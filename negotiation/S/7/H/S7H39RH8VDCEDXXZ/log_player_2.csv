"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than my limit and even higher than her own valuation. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $1,250,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We are getting closer. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000. Alice is showing signs of being flexible, so continuing the negotiation seems like the right choice at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This shows I'm serious about closing the deal while recognizing the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I need, but $1,025,000 isn't quite there yet. To be honest, I'd feel better closing this deal at $1,075,000. This allows both of us to walk away happy with a solid deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is not budging enough, and at this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her not going any lower. I can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It makes more sense to take the sure deal."
