"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. The product is worth a lot to me, and I need to make a profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $105. That's a fair price for both of us. ",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I can do $115, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is already a compromise for me.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $110. That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. ",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already told you I won't go below $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115, so I'll offer you $112.50. That's the best I can do.",112.5,Alice,7,
