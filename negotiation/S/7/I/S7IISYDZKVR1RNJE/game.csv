"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and while it's worth significantly more to me, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects a fair compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while ensuring I receive a reasonable return.  Consider this a unique opportunity to secure this product. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
