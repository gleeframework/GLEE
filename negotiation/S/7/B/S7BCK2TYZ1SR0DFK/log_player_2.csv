Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she will go much lower than $10,250, and we can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
