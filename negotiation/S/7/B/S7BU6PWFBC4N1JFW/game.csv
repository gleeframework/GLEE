"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to find a price closer to its true worth to me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $950000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $900000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $925000.  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's get this done.",925000.0,Alice,5,
