Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  My starting price is $1,000,000. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to find a price closer to its true worth to me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  There's still a chance I can get a better deal with Bob, and I have 8 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $950,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a proposal of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not satisfied. I have several rounds left, and I'm confident that with careful negotiation, I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not going to settle for anything significantly below $1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $900,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, we're getting close, and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds. Accepting Bob's offer at $910,000 ensures a profitable sale and prevents me from potentially losing out to John's offer if I continue to negotiate with Bob."
