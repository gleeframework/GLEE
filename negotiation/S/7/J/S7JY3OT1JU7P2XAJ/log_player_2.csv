"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can get the product for a better price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and moving on to a counteroffer is the best option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Buying from John is the best option as you can get the product for your maximum budget."
