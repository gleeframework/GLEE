"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I can earn a good profit and you get a valuable product at a price lower than its worth. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
