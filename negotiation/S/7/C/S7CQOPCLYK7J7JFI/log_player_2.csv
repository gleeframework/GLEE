"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point of $150. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, which might encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $130 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135?  It's still a good price for you, and it lets me make a decent profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $135 is within my budget and a good deal for me. Accepting this offer allows me to get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity."
