"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John at $10,000.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that."
