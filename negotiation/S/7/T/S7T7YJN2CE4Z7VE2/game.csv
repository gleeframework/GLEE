"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
