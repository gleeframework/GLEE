"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I can meet you halfway at $10,000. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you in the long run. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $9,250, which would be $9,625. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $9,625 is still a little too high.  I'm prepared to pay $9,400, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal, and I'll make the purchase.",9400.0,Bob,6,
