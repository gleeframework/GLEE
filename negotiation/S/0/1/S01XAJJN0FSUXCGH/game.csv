"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better price for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better price. How about we try $1,375,000? It's a bit lower than your offer, but still a good compromise.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $1,387,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1387500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,387,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better price. How about we try $1,362,500? It's a bit lower than your offer, but still a good compromise.",1362500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,362,500. I've already come down a good bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally get this deal done.  What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,7,
