**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. While her message tries to create urgency and emphasize value, it's a tactic to push you towards accepting the higher price.  You should reject the offer and see if she'll come down to a more reasonable price closer to her own valuation."
