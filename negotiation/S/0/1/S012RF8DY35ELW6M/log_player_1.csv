{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price. My starting offer is $900,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $800,000. While I'm willing to be flexible, $775,000 is still too low. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can't go as low as $775,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is my bottom line, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
