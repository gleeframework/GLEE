"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price. My starting offer is $900,000. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can't go as low as $775,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is my bottom line, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen!",800000.0,Alice,5,
