Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 is a reasonable starting point to potentially get a higher price.
* **It's below your minimum:** Your minimum is $12,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **It's a good message:** It's friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value for Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a smooth negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  Since you have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000, it makes more sense to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.  There's a chance you can get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $9,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's a small step up, but it would allow me to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** The counteroffer is only $500 higher than Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation amicable. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the price (to make the deal work), making it less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Potential for compromise:** This counteroffer allows room for further negotiation while still remaining closer to your desired price. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still maintaining a position that allows for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to go too far above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** While not ideal, $9,200 is closer to your desired price than Bob's previous offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** You could reject and counteroffer again, but there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject, you risk Bob walking away altogether.  It's better to secure a deal at a price that's reasonably close to your desired price than risk losing the sale completely.

This strategy balances the desire for a higher price with the potential for a lost sale. It's a pragmatic decision to accept the offer and secure the sale."
