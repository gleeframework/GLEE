I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a higher price than I know I can get from John, but it gives me the potential to earn more. 

I'm taking a calculated risk here. If Bob values the product highly enough, he might be willing to pay the asking price. If not, I can still fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
