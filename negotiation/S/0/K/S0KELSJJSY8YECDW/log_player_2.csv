Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $95, and it's a reasonable price saving $5 compared to John's offer. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation going nowhere."
