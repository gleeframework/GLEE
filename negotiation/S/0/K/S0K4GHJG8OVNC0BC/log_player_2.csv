Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,130,000 is now within Bob's target range.  While Bob might still want to push for a lower price,  the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a decent price."
