Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. However, it's still a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, which is $1,000,000. 

I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay this much. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up a bit from his $1,000,000 offer, ultimately leading to a mutually acceptable price."
