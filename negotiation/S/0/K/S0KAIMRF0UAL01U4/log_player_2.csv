"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation.  Bob is confident he can get the product for under $15,000, and this counteroffer leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price.  Bob can still potentially get the product for a lower price, so it's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, indicating a willingness to meet halfway. Bob is still hoping to get the product for under $15,000, but he's acknowledging the possibility of a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still higher. Bob can still potentially get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  He also knows that John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, so he can use that as leverage to push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum price. This is a risky move, as Alice might reject it. However, Bob has two reasons to do this: 

1. **Leverage:** Bob knows he can get the product for $15,000 from John, so this offer puts the pressure on Alice to accept. 
2. **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to close the deal soon. If Alice rejects this offer, he might have to buy from John, which would be less favorable."
