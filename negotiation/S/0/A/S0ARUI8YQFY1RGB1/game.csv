"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $12,750. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really close to my budget, and I'm only able to go up to $12,600. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize this deal.",12600.0,Bob,6,
