Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $130 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob is being firm at $130.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a better deal than selling to John."
