"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $110 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice came down in price, and $130 is a reasonable deal. It's not worth risking going higher or going to John at this point."
