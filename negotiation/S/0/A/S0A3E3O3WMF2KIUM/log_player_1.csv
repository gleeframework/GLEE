Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a starting point that attempts to balance my desire for a high price with the potential of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob. It's more than Bob's valuation but significantly less than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation while still leaving me a healthy profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and less than what John is offering. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum.  However, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has slightly increased his offer, it's still not close to my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, selling to him is the best course of action at this time.  There's a chance Bob might come up with a better offer, but I don't want to risk losing the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
