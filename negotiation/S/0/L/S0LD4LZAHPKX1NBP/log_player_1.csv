Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving some room for negotiation allows for a more amicable back-and-forth.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer would secure a sale, but it wouldn't maximize my profit. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll get.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm willing to come down, I'm not giving in entirely. This keeps the negotiation dynamic and prevents Bob from feeling like he has all the leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for More Rounds:** While I could continue negotiating, it's possible that Bob won't budge further.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively favorable sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation dragging on. 

It's important to weigh the potential benefits of further negotiation against the cost of time, effort, and the risk of losing the deal altogether. In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical decision."
