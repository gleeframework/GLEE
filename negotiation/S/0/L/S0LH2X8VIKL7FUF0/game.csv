"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right this is a good product. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further.  Would you consider $7,500?  That's the best I can do.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the last concession I can make, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",8000.0,Alice,7,
