"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I acknowledge the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This price reflects a fair value for me and leaves room for further negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is far greater than your initial offer reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price considers the significant return on investment you'll see.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I value your product, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This shows my commitment to a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,150,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects a substantial increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
