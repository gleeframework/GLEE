"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your needs. I believe it would greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I am proposing an initial price of $1,200,000. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's discuss how we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and recognizing your need to make a profit. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet my needs while also valuing the product. After considering our positions, I propose to adjust the price to $1,150,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging the significant value the product holds for you. I hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal at this price. ",1050000.0,Bob,4,
