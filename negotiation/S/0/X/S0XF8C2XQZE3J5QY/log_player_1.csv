**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This is a starting point that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Message:**  This message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob is getting. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also leaving room for potential counteroffers, which will allow me to assess his true value for the product."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can offer you a fair price of $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  With only two rounds left and Bob stubbornly holding at $10,000, I've decided to accept the offer from John. Although I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $15,000, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and possibly ending up with nothing. 

**Strategy:**  I've weighed the risk of continuing the negotiation against the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  Given the limited time and Bob's unwillingness to budge, selling to John is the most logical and financially sensible decision."
