"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a price closer to the middle ground we discussed earlier. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would allow you a good deal while also ensuring I receive a fair return on my product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer!  While I'm willing to make a compromise, $10,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",10250.0,Alice,7,
