"Alice, that's a great offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $8500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $10000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet you halfway from $9250? I'm thinking $10250 is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
