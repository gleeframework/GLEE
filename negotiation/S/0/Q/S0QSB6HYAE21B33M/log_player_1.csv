Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I'm sure you can make a significant profit with it at that price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the potential for Bob to profit, making the offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:** This price leaves room for me to potentially go lower if necessary, but it gives me a strong starting point.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, based on my current financial situation, I am only able to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, potentially closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer as backup:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,150,000? This still leaves you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Stay Firm:** I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but I'm not going too far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value and Profit:** The message focuses on the value of the product and the profit potential for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Building Towards Agreement:**  This counteroffer is a step closer to a potential agreement, demonstrating my willingness to work with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my price, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid I can't go above $1,050,000 for the product. I've done some research and believe this is a fair price given its market value and potential for profit. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and delaying a sale.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is my desired outcome.

**Conclusion:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This decision maximizes my profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum price."
