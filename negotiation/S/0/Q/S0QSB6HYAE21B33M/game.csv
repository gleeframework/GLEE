"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, based on my current financial situation, I am only able to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,150,000? This still leaves you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid I can't go above $1,050,000 for the product. I've done some research and believe this is a fair price given its market value and potential for profit. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
