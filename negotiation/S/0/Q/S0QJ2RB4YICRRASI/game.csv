"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $11000 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $9500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $10250. This is a fair price that allows us both to come out ahead.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10250 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
