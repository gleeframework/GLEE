"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $900,000 for the product. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle on $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking we're getting close to a reasonable price, so I'll offer you $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know now.",800000.0,Alice,5,
