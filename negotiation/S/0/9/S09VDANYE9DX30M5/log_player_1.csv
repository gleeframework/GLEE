Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** Offering $12,000 allows for potential counteroffers while still ensuring a profit for me. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider making a lower counteroffer or opting to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can close the deal with him.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a more mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  which reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Flexibility:** $11,500 still gives me a decent profit and leaves room for another counteroffer from Bob if needed.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $11,500. I would like to propose a final offer of $10,500. This amount closely aligns with my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Further counteroffers with Bob are unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired range.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $15,000, which is significantly higher than the current offer from Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Although I would prefer to sell to Bob if I could get a better price, the risk of further negotiation with him and potentially ending up with an even lower offer outweighs the potential gain. Therefore, selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision at this point."
