Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price might entice Bob while still yielding a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides leverage. I don't need to go below my minimum.
* **Psychology:** A slightly higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
