"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. I believe a million dollars is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to me is at least $800,000. Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This price is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum value for the product.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept this price and close the deal. It's a good outcome for me, and it saves me the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John."
