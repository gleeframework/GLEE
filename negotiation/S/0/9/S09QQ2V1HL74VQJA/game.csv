"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good deal and ensuring I can make a profit. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,5,
