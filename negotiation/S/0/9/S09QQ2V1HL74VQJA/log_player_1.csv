Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to sell for at least $1,200,000, so you have room to lower the price if needed.
* **It shows flexibility:**  It shows Bob you're open to negotiation, which can encourage him to counteroffer. 

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to consider his offer, it's too low to justify selling at this point.  

You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, potentially meeting him somewhere in the middle, but accepting his initial offer would be a huge loss."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price. It's important to remember you have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,200,000. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price."
