"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product for $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefits for Bob to emphasize the value of the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $10,000, I allow for multiple rounds of negotiation before having to accept a lower price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, I am still not happy with that offer.  I want to see if I can get Bob to go higher. 

I will counter with an offer closer to my desired price, but still below what I would get from John.  This will give me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000.  How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise that would allow you to get a great product at a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and reiterate the benefits of purchasing it.
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""reasonable price"" encourages Bob to see the offer as mutually beneficial. 

This counteroffer gives me a chance to earn more than Bob's initial offer while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within $8,000. Could we possibly agree on a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $9,000 price point. While this is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. There are still 6 rounds left, and I might be able to convince Bob to come up a bit more. 

I'll make a counteroffer again, but this time I'll emphasize the value of the product and the time remaining in the negotiation.  This may encourage Bob to reconsider."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but we're running out of time! This product is truly worth more than $9,000, and I'm confident you'll see the value once you have it. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go down to $9,250. It's the best I can do, and it's a fantastic price for this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time pressure:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that time is running out, potentially making him more willing to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth and the benefits he'll gain from purchasing it.
* **Final offer stance:** I'm presenting this as my ""best offer,"" implying that I'm unlikely to go lower, which could push Bob towards acceptance.
* **Slight decrease:**  I'm offering a smaller decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm moving closer to Bob's price but not giving in completely. 

This approach aims to build urgency and encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer, getting me closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $8,750 for the product. This allows us to stay close to my budget while still acknowledging the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to accept $8,750.  It's too far below my minimum acceptable price. I need to see if I can get Bob to go higher.

I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still slightly lower than my previous offer. I'll also try to emphasize the limited time remaining to see if I can push Bob to make a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fantastic deal for you, and it's my last offer.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:**  I'm clearly stating this is my ""last offer"" to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise language:**  ""Final compromise"" indicates I'm being flexible, but also implies that further concessions are unlikely.
* **Value emphasis:**  I remind Bob of the product's value and how the price is still a good deal.

At this point, I'm pushing hard to get closer to my desired price, knowing that I have only 3 rounds left. This counteroffer should put pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. After careful consideration, I'd like to counter with an offer of $8,500 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached a critical point.  Bob's offer of $8,500 is too low, and we're down to our last two rounds.  

If I reject Bob's offer and counter, there's a high chance he'll reject my final offer, leaving me with nothing. It's a risky gamble, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. 

Therefore, it's more advantageous to sell to John at this point.  While I won't get my ideal price, it's still a guaranteed $12,000, which is higher than anything Bob has offered and above my minimum acceptable value.  Selling to John secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing."
