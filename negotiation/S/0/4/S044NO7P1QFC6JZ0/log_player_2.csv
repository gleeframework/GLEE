Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $7,750 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $8,500. Would you consider $8,250?  It's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is very stubbornly sticking close to her asking price.  It's unlikely further haggling will get you significantly below $8,250, and John is offering the product for $8,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice short and go with the guaranteed better deal."
