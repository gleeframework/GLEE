"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($10,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting the initial offer opens the door for counteroffers and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $12,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $14,000 but still above Alice's minimum value of $10,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is within Bob's budget and is closer to the product's value to Alice. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and eventually reaching a higher price, or even losing the deal altogether, is significant. Accepting the offer at $13,000 ensures a successful transaction at a reasonable price."
