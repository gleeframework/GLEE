Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?

Bob is not going to budge much past $11,500. It's time to cut bait and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
