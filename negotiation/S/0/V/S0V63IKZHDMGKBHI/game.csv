"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $975,000 for the product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $912,500 for the product. This seems like a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",912500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $912,500. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $940,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $940,000 is still above my limit.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. I'm offering $925,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $935,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",935000.0,Alice,7,
