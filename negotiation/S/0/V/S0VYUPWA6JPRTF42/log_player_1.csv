Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get a better deal. To make this work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $1050000.  This would still give you a healthy profit, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
