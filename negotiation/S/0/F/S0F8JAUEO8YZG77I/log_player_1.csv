{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to potentially get a good price. I'm also being friendly and making it clear I believe Bob might be a good fit for the product, hoping to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to negotiate, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $160?  I think this is a fair price that values the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go up to $160. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $140? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum threshold of $150. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a sale rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
