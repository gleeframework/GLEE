"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to secure a fair price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $1,300,000 is better than John's offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that offers us both a good deal. Let's work towards this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer.  While I value your business, $1,250,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm offering the product for $1,275,000,  Let's close this deal at a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is only $25,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and sticking to this price, or even increasing it. It's also possible that John could change his price if the negotiations drag on.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob a good deal and avoids those risks."
