"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe the product is a good one, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $10000. Can we meet in the middle at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500.  This reflects a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still not sure it's the right price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6000. Can we meet in the middle at $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to offer you the product at $8200. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6500. Can we meet in the middle at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
