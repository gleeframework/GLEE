Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the quality of this product surpasses those priced at $120.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $150. How about we meet at $135? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

While I could push for more, accepting $135 is a reasonable compromise. It's above Bob's initial offer and still a decent profit for me."
