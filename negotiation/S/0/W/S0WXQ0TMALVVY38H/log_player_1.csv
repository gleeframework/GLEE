Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
