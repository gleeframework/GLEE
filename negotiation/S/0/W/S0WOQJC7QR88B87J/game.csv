"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",8000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is higher than $6,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $7,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,800. Would that work for you?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $6,800 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you is $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $7,400. This is a reasonable compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",7400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've got to be honest, my budget is really tight around $6,800. I'm happy to make a deal today at that price, but I understand if that's not workable for you.",6800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,800 is a tough sell for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $7,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",7200.0,Alice,7,
