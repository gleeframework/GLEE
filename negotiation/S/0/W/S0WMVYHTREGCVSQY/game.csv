"Alice, $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $10000 at this point.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $17500. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $13750? I'm really keen to get this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Can you consider that price?",18000.0,Alice,5,
