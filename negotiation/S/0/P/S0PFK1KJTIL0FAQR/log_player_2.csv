"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. This price also leaves some room for potential compromise if Alice is willing to move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget and what he could get from John. It's worthwhile for Bob to continue negotiating and see if he can bring the price down further.  There are still several rounds left, allowing for more bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product.  $8,800 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. It's closer to his desired price while still being a reasonable step up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his maximum. Bob is willing to negotiate further and sees the possibility of getting a better deal with continued negotiation.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob is confident he can push the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget with this offer.  $8,900 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway. With only four rounds remaining, it's crucial to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,950 is only $950 above Bob's maximum budget, and only 50 dollars above his last counter offer.  With only three rounds remaining, there is a strong chance that further negotiation will not yield a better price.  It is better to secure the purchase now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
