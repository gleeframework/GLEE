Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, and I would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about considering the product at $95? This is still above your initial offer, but it's closer to what I'm looking for, while also being within your budget range.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'd like to propose $90 for the product. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but still below my original asking price. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $90 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely further haggling will get you much closer to $85, and risking John changing his mind or running out of stock isn't worth the potential savings."
