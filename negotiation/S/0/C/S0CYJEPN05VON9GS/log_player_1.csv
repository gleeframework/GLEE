Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you think the product is ""perfect"" for Bob, you are subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Letting Bob know you have other options (""list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.

While there's a chance Bob might reject $120, you have a backup plan with John at $100."
