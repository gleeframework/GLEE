Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to offer a price that's significantly better than John's standing offer of $100.  Continuing negotiations with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, but it also risks him walking away. Accepting John's offer is the safest option to guarantee a profit and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations."
