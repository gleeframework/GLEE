Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with an ambitious offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's benefits and future value, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear we're open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Reservation Price:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:** There is room for negotiation. We started high, and Bob countered lower, which is a typical negotiation pattern.
* **John as a Backup:** We have the security of John's offer, ensuring we won't be forced to accept a price below our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your number. How about we settle on a price of $1,100,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're showing flexibility by reducing our price by $50,000, signaling our willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** The new price of $1,100,000 represents a compromise, aiming for a price point roughly in the middle of the previous offers. 
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a positive and collaborative tone to foster a good negotiating atmosphere."
