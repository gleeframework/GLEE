"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. It's a good starting point that gives me some room to negotiate while still getting a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $10,000 to John. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise after Bob's low offer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of time. I'm not comfortable with a price that low, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $10,000. I'm going to sell to John to secure a fair price and avoid further haggling with Bob."
