"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $105 out of this deal. Can we talk about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $98? It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $110. How about we meet at $105, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of extras, Alice, but I'm really trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you consider $100 even? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a lot of concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for $100. That's below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,7,
