"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $12,800.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you think $12,800 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,6,
