The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120.  You can potentially get it for less, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm a bit hesitant to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  $115 is better than $120, but you can likely get it for even less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we add a small premium to that price? I'll offer it to you for $120, but that's as low as I can go.

Alice has come back up to her original price of $120.  While you'd prefer to pay less, it's still a good deal for you compared to buying from John for $150. You've saved $30, and it seems unlikely Alice will go lower."
