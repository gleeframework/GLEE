Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation"", I signal that I'm willing to compromise, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** $100 is higher than John's offer of $80, so I'm not immediately risking losing out on a sale. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Me:**  My minimum selling price is $80.  While Bob's offer is above that, it's still lower than my desired price. 
* **Potential for Better Offer:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate. There's a good chance I can push him closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** I'm not in a rush to sell to John, especially since I think there's a chance for a better outcome with Bob. 

**Next Move:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a good profit.
* **Strong Justification:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:**  By offering a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation alive and avoiding selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $95 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could you do $90? That would really help me out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** $90 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:**  While I could potentially push for $95, there's a chance Bob might walk away completely. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a good price without risking a longer, potentially unproductive negotiation.

I'm confident that $90 is a fair outcome, considering Bob's interest and my minimum selling price."
