"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price point of $12,000. I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so he's unlikely to accept this offer, but it establishes my starting point and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I am willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is another compromise on my part, and it's getting close to Bob's perceived value of the product.  It's also a good strategy because if he rejects this, I can go to John and still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While I would prefer to get my initial asking price of $12,000, Bob has shown that he is unwilling to go above $10,000. John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, so I'll take that deal."
