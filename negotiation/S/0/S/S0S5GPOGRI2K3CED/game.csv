"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000.  It's a fair deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make at least $1,600,000 on this. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. Can we compromise on that?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $1,500,000. It's a fair price considering what the product is worth to you. Let's try to make this work. How about $1,525,000? It's a small step towards your price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,525,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,475,000. Can we find a mutually beneficial price?",1475000.0,Bob,6,
