"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This allows for a healthy profit for you while also reflecting the value I hold for this product.  Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to me, but also allows for a more reasonable profit for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value I have for the product while still offering you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the effort to find common ground.  $950,000 is closer, but still leaves me with a significant loss compared to what I'd receive from another buyer. To make this work for me, I need to stick with $1,000,000.  This allows us both a healthy profit and allows me to move forward. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
