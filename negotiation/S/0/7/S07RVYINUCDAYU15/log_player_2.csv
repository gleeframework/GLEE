"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This allows for a healthy profit for you while also reflecting the value I hold for this product.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value I have for the product while still offering you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the effort to find common ground.  $950,000 is closer, but still leaves me with a significant loss compared to what I'd receive from another buyer. To make this work for me, I need to stick with $1,000,000.  This allows us both a healthy profit and allows me to move forward. Let's see if we can finalize this.
