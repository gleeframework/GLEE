Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,750 is still a bit steep for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, but he also wants to get the product. Alice has come down to $13,250, which is a better price than John's $15,000.  There's a chance Alice won't budge further, so accepting her offer is the most logical choice. It secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and is a good deal compared to other options."
