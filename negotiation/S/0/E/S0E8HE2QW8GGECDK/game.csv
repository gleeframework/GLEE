"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great fit for someone with your interests and needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,750 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to you and would save you the hassle of finding another buyer.  Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,250. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.
