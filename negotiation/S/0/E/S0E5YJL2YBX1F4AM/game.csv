"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $137.50? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $137.50. How about we meet in the middle between $137.50 and my previous offer of $145? I'm thinking $140.75. Would you be willing to meet me there?",140.75,Alice,7,
