Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's important to balance getting the best deal with the risk of running out of time and having to sell to John for a lower price. Considering the current offer is just slightly lower than my minimum, it's strategically better to accept and secure the sale before potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
