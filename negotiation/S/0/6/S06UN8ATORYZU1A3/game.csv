"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference again and land at $800,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,5,
