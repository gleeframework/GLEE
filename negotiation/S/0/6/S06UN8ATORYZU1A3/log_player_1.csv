I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference again and land at $800,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.
