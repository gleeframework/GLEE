"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This would allow me to cover my costs and give you a valuable product. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
