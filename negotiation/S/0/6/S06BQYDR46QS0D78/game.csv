"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on the product.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $925,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a good compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,5,
