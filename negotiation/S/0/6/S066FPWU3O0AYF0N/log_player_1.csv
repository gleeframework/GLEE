Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. 

Here's why:

* **Profit:** I'm aiming for a profit of $20, which is better than the $0 I'd get if Bob rejects and I sell to John.
* **Attractiveness:**  The price is still significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product ($120), making it likely he'll accept. 
* **Backup:**  Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John, ensuring I don't lose money."
