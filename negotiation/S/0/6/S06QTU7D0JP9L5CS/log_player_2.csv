Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $600,000 is your current limit.  However, I'm unable to go that low.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this happen.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $700,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer and allows us both to make progress.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
