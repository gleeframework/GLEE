"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives you a good deal while still acknowledging the product's value.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. I'll offer $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $975,000 is still below what I consider fair.  Let's close this deal. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This is a final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
