"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,250. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? This is a fair price that allows you to get the product and me to meet my minimum. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
