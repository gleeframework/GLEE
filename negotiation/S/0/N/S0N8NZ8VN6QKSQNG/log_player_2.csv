Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to compromise further on the price.

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting her offer of $630,000 is a good deal considering the product's value and the fact that John would charge us $1,000,000."
