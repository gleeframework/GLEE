"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. I'm still quite interested, but $700,000 is a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $600,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $650,000 is getting close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $625,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $630,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",630000.0,Alice,7,
