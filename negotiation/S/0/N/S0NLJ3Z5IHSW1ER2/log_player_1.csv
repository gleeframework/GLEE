Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You want to maximize your profit, so starting high is crucial.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without you feeling like you need to immediately accept.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a price that's close to your ideal outcome, you demonstrate that you're not just fishing for a lowball offer. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or you reach an impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and well below the value he places on the product.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your negotiating position:** Accepting a low offer weakens your position for future negotiations. 
* **Explore better options:** By rejecting, you can counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Consider selling to John:** If the negotiations with Bob stall, you have a backup option to sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go below $850,000. This price still offers you a significant gain, and it's closer to the product's true value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is a good move:

* **It's firm but fair:** It's clear you won't accept Bob's low offer but are willing to compromise. 
* **It emphasizes value:** You reiterate that the product is worth more than Bob's offer.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** There's still space for negotiation, allowing Bob to come up with a counteroffer closer to your desired price. 

Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John if you feel the negotiations are going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me. Can you meet me at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired outcome and your last counteroffer. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your negotiating power:** Accepting his offer could set a precedent for future negotiations.
* **Explore a better deal:** By rejecting, you can counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Consider selling to John:** Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if you're not satisfied with Bob's offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but I can't go below $800,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the value the product holds for you and the significant gains it will bring you. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Final Offer:**  This establishes that you are serious about this price and aren't willing to negotiate further.
* **Compromise:**  You've met Bob halfway by lowering your price from $850,000 to $800,000.
* **Focus on Value:** You emphasize the significant gains Bob will experience by using the product.

This approach puts pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer for $800,000 if negotiations break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. Can you think about meeting me at $775,000, or I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has indicated he is unwilling to meet your minimum acceptable price. While $775,000 is closer to your desired outcome than his previous offers, it still falls short of your minimum.  You have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000, which is a better option than risking further negotiations with Bob that may not result in a higher price.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
