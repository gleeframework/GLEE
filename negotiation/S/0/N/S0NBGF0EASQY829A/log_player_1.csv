"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($150) to give me room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Opening:** The message is friendly and open-ended to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value for Bob, which might make him more open to negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John is a fallback option:**  I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer."

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While Bob seems determined to get a low price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **John is a reliable backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept a lower offer.  I'll likely only accept a price of $140 or higher at this point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $125 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $135. If you're serious about buying, this is my best price. "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final concession, showing I'm open to negotiation but also setting a clear limit.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No significant increase:** Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous offer, and still below my minimum acceptable value.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation. 
* **Limited time:**  Time is running out, and John is a safe alternative to risk further negotiation with Bob."
