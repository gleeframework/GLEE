Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,250,000, which reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but reasonable starting point:** Aiming high allows room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Highlighting value, not just price:** The message focuses on the product's benefits, subtly reinforcing its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving the door open for negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach maximizes the potential profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation. 

* **Best-case scenario:** Bob accepts the offer, and you make a significant profit.
* **Good scenario:** Bob negotiates, and you settle on a price higher than your minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Worst-case scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John at your desired price.

This strategy ensures you're in a strong position, regardless of Bob's decision."
