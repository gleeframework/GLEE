"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is interesting to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential returns.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I see you're serious, so I'm prepared to make a significant move. However,  $950,000 is too far below its true value.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This is the lowest I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
