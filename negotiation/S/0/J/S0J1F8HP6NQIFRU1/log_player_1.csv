Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I'm confident you'll find this a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John gives me leverage.
* **Psychology:**  Offering a ""limited time"" deal creates a sense of urgency and the slightly discounted price ($119) might seem more appealing than a round number like $120. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the sale."
