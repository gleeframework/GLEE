"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my absolute maximum is $95. If you're willing to come down to that, we have a deal. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $95, which would be $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
