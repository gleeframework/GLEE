"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my own assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,600,000  was already a significant reduction from my initial evaluation. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the true worth of this product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
