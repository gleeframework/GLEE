"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $150, which is more than it's worth to her. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate. It's definitely worth rejecting the offer and trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 
This is the maximum price I'm willing to pay, as I can get the product from John for this price. If Alice is truly willing to sell, she should accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than the product is worth to her. While $130 is better than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum price. It's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed deal with John at $100."
