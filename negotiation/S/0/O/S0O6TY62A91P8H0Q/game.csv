"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we settle for $8,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll give you an additional discount of $200, so the new price would be $8,800. That's as low as I can go!",8800.0,Alice,5,
