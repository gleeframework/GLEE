(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $12,000 is above your desired price range of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** It's good to know John is an option, but you want to try and get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive first counteroffer:** I'm starting with a lower price to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly.
* **Within your budget:**  $9,000 is well within your budget and allows for potential further negotiation.
* **Not too low:**  While it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for both parties to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:**  $11,000 is still above your desired price range.
* **More negotiation needed:** There's still room to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown some flexibility by dropping her price from $12,000 to $11,000.
* **Buying from John is a last resort:** You're still early in the negotiation process and have time to try to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm raising my offer by $1,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget.
* **Mid-point approach:** $10,000 is the midpoint between Alice's last offer ($11,000) and my previous offer ($9,000), making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will gauge if Alice is willing to meet you halfway or if she'll hold firm at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is very close to your desired price range of $15,000, and well within your budget.
* **Negotiation is likely over:** Given Alice's previous counteroffers, it's likely she won't drop her price much further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's a risk that Alice might not accept your next counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic decision at this point.  It saves you money compared to buying from John and secures the product without risking further negotiation."
