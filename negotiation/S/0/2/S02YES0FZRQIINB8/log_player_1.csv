Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $8,900? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a competitive price. "", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8900 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We've reached a stalemate, and while I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $8,750 is a decent outcome. It's significantly more than selling to John, and further negotiation might not yield a better result."
