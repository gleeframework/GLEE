Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate further if Bob counters, while still leaving a good profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe $110 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me, considering my minimum is $80.  It's better than selling to John, and the negotiations have gone on long enough.  I'll take the deal."
