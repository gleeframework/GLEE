"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a rare and valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's offer is also $15,000, you are not saving any money by accepting her offer.  You can get the product for the same price from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best decision to keep your options open and potentially find a better deal."
