"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. $10,000 is still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000), and Bob has room to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance he can get it for less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Alice ($8,000).  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget ($12,000) and is a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer, and he'd be left with the option of buying from John at a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
