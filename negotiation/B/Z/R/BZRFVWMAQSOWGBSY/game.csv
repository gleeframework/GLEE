"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal now, or I might have to move on to another buyer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
