"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll do $15,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. That's the highest I can go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's try $14,250. That's a good compromise and I think we can both be happy with that price.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $14,000. How about we meet at $13,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",13750.0,Bob,6,
