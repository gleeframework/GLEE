Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is quite far from what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget limitations."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $7,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to consider $15,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000, which is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
