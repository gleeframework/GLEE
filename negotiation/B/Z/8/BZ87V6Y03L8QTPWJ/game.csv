"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is quite far from what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget limitations.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $7,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to consider $15,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
