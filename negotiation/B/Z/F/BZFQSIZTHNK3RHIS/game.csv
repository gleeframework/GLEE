"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even more potential for you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its potential value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $950,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This is a very fair price considering the product's potential value to you. Let's see if we can agree on this and finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so how about $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there at $975,000. It's important for me to get closer to my desired value. Let's split the difference again. How about $987,500? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",987500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you want to get closer to your desired value, but I'm still not comfortable with $987,500. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",980000.0,Bob,8,
