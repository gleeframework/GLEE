Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand it's a lot, but I'm willing to come down to $14000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer and a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?
