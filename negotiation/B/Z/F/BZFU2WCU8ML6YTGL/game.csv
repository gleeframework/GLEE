"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth a lot more than that to the right person.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand it's a lot, but I'm willing to come down to $14000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer and a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
