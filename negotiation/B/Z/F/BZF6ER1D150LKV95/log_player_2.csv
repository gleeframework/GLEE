"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's budget.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that offers a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still only two rounds into the negotiation and has a backup option with John. Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, with the potential to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  My final offer is $825,000.  This is a strong offer that allows you to make a significant profit while also giving me a great deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $900000, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $862500. This is a reasonable compromise that should satisfy both of our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now five rounds into the negotiation and Alice is still unwilling to come down below $862,500. This is getting very close to Bob's budget, but he's also at a point where he's spent a lot of time negotiating, and Alice doesn't seem very flexible.  

Since Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, it makes more sense to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John.  He's saved $62,500 compared to Alice's last offer and has minimized the time spent negotiating."
