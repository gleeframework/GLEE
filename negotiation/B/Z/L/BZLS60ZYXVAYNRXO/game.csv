"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. To start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This takes into account its value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,300,000 is still significantly outside my budget. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget limitations and the product's potential. Let's work towards an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair valuation.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the value you place on this product, $1,150,000 is still too much for me. To show my commitment to making a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
