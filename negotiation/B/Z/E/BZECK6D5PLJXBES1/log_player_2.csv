"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price is a significant discount compared to its value to me, and I believe it's a fair offer that provides value for both of us. Please consider this carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $1,500,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
