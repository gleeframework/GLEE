(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is far above his budget, and he has better options."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 40% to $600,000. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a substantial amount, but still within his budget.  This allows for room for negotiation and sets a strong starting point."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He should reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

Bob raises his offer to $700,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice he's willing to meet her halfway. It's still within his budget, but it's closer to Alice's desired price. This move could lead to a quicker agreement."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is close to Bob's budget, it's still above what he wants to pay. He has a backup option with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get a better price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down further, especially since Bob has been persistent."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is his maximum budget, and a fair compromise. It's time to see if Alice will accept it. He's willing to pay John this amount, so there's no need to go lower, and if Alice is willing to negotiate, this could be the sweet spot."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, she's still above his budget. It's worth seeing if she'll budge further.  He has a solid fallback option with John, so there's no need to rush into this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Bob sticks with his maximum offer of $800,000. He's already at his limit and knows John is willing to sell at this price. It's time to see if Alice will accept his final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's time to take the guaranteed deal! Bob has already made it clear he's willing to pay $800,000, but Alice is still being stubborn. With only two rounds left, it's too risky to continue negotiating.  John is a reliable alternative and Bob can get the product for his desired price."
