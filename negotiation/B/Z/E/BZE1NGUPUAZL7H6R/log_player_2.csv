"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $13,250?  That's a compromise from my initial offer and closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $13,250 is still a bit more than Bob wants to pay, but it's a good compromise.  If he rejects the offer and counteroffers again, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and he risks losing the product altogether. It's also possible that Alice might accept his counteroffer and he'll end up paying the same amount. Buying from John would mean getting a lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice will not come down any further and he'll lose the product to John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice, balancing a good price with the risk of losing the product to another seller."
