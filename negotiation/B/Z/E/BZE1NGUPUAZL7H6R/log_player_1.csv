Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000 valuation, giving him a potential benefit from the deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's lower than your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  It's a significant discount, but not so much that it seems like you're desperate to sell.

By offering a good starting point, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a productive negotiation. Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.  Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **You have leverage:**  You know John is willing to pay $15,000, giving you a strong bargaining position.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still a $1,500 gap between Bob's offer and your minimum. A counteroffer can bridge this gap and potentially lead to a deal that's more favorable for you.
* **You're not giving up:** Selling to John is always an option if the negotiation fails. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control and increase the chances of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $13,250?  That's a compromise from my initial offer and closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.  This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Reasonable increase:** The $750 increase from Bob's offer is a moderate step up, making it less likely Bob will immediately reject it. 
* **Maintaining your position:** You're still above your minimum of $15,000, but you're showing flexibility to reach a deal.

This counteroffer positions you to potentially close the deal while still ensuring a decent profit."
