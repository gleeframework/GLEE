"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations at a point slightly above your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing the product's high value.
* **Strong Stance:** Offering it at your walk-away price immediately signals that you believe in the product's worth and are not desperate to sell. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer and start a discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal with Bob before considering John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's early in the negotiation, and we have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the product's true value is significantly higher.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Dropping $100,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm to a price significantly above both Bob's offer and his perceived value.
* **Anchoring:** By offering $900,000, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to our desired price point. This can influence Bob's subsequent offers.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reinforces the product's high value, justifying the price reduction as a gesture of goodwill rather than a reflection of the product's worth.

We are still in the early rounds, and this strategy keeps the negotiation open while pushing for a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $700,000 is still significantly less than our minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and we're willing to counter to see if we can reach a more agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our conversation and believe we can still make a deal. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) creates urgency and subtly increases the product's perceived value. This doesn't have to be a bluff; it's simply leveraging the existing situation. 
* **Firm but Fair:** Offering $800,000 is both firm (as it's our bottom line) and fair (meeting Bob at his perceived value). 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  Directly asking if Bob is willing to meet halfway makes it clear this is our final offer and encourages a decision.

This approach aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while reminding him of the alternative and pushing for a close."
