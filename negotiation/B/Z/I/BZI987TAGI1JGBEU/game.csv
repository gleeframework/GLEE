"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price we can both be happy with. How does $12,000 sound? It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
