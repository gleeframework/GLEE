"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will choose option 2: Reject Alice's offer, because I can get the product for $8,000 from John. Alice's offer is higher than John's offer, so I'll reject it.
