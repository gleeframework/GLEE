Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high but within reason.  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Starting at $925,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the price and increasing his perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give yourself more wiggle room.
* **Market Factors:** Are there other potential buyers similar to Bob? If so, you have more leverage to aim higher."
