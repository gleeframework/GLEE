"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, it's still above your target of $120.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $110. Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a little. However, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $112.50.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112.50, which is within your acceptable range of $120.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance she might hold firm at this price.  It's likely a better deal to accept her offer than to risk losing the product or buying it from John at a higher price."
