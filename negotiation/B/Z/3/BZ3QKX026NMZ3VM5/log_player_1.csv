"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,700,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, framing the offer as a great deal. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually decrease the price if necessary, while also keeping John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.  I want to maximize my profit while ensuring a deal is reached within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about we aim for $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my starting offer and still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Reasoning:** While I want to close a deal, I'm not desperate. I have John as a backup option who is willing to pay my minimum price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target, but still leaving some room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,550,000?  It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $1,550,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  This price is also significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I reiterate that $1,200,000 is too low for me, but emphasize that I'm willing to compromise. I frame the new price as ""fair"" and highlight the potential benefits for both of us. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a firm stance.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that balances my desire for a good profit with the need to close the deal. By gradually decreasing my price, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to come up in his offer and ultimately reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has increased his offer to $1,400,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm not in a rush to close the deal. I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation going and potentially push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise."

```

**Explanation:**

I'm also keeping John as a backup option, which gives me the leverage to push back against Bob's offers if necessary. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more assertive in finding a solution."

{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I think we're both getting closer to a deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm trying to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to Bob. I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price, but I'm being more flexible in my counteroffers to reach a deal. I'm also using a more assertive tone to encourage Bob to accept my proposal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not confident I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John at my desired price. 
* **Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I need to prioritize securing the best possible price for my product. John is a reliable buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity. 

**Outcome:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I've made a calculated decision to sell to John and secure a deal at my minimum price. This ensures that I don't lose out on a valuable opportunity."
