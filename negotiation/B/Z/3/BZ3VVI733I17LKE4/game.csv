"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $950,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, but considering my financial situation, $1,050,000 is still quite high. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
