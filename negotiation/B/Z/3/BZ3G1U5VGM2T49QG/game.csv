"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm counteroffering at $17500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",17500.0,Alice,3,,
