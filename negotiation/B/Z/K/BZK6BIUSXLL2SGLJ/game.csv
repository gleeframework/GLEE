,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
