Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
