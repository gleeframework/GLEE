# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product name] for a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to secure a product that's directly aligned with your needs and worth exactly the same to you.  I understand the value of this product to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Consider this a fair and mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as the price you would pay John. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but there is no information provided to indicate that.  Therefore, rejecting her offer and buying from John is the best strategy given the information provided."
