"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've done some research and I know this product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or Bob losing the product to another buyer exists. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage."
