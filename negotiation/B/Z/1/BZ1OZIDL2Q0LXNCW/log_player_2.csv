"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. There's a chance you could get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down in price."
