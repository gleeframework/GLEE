{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can save $300,000 by negotiating with Alice further. While $900,000 is better than John's price, it's still within your budget and worth trying to lower further."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer keeps going up. At this point, it's better to buy from John for $1,200,000. Even though it's the most expensive option, you've reached a point where further negotiation with Alice isn't likely to yield a significantly better price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks the chance she'll walk away completely, leaving you with no product."
