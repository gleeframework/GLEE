Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,800. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price that's closer to Bob's last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,400. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get a little more, $9,000 is a reasonable offer and very close to my minimum.  It's not worth risking losing this sale and having to sell to John for less."
