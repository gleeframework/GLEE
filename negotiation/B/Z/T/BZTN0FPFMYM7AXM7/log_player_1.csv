Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. It's a substantial discount, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I've set the price at $900,000. This leaves $100,000 on the table for Bob, making it a potentially appealing deal for him.
* **Message:** The message highlights the value of the product to me and emphasizes the significant discount.  It also uses a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes Profit:**  While I'm willing to take a small hit from my ideal price, $900,000 still represents a substantial profit for me.
* **Appeals to Bob:** The offer provides Bob with a considerable gain over what he believes the product is worth, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Minimizes Risk:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum desired price, guaranteeing my profit."
