"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. How about we aim for $900,000? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than the value I'm seeking for the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let's meet halfway.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we set the price at $950,000? This would still give you a good profit while aligning closely with my valuation of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
