"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a substantial profit margin.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to accept a lower counteroffer, especially since it's still above her own valuation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a price closer to his budget by making another counteroffer. The risk of going to John is still present, but this negotiation seems promising."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $860,000 is still slightly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $865,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a price that will allow us both to come to an agreement.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is $800,000, Alice's offer of $865,000 is only $65,000 above that.  This is a relatively small difference considering the product's true value.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer guarantees the purchase and keeps the cost within a reasonable range."
