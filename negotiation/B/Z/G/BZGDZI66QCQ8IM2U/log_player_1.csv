Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport and a price that is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, while still leaving room for negotiation. It gives Bob a good starting point for discussion and allows you to potentially close the deal quickly.  If he rejects, you can then gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your desired price point. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That way we both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still working within my budget constraints. Could we possibly agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to your desired price and you're at a point where further negotiations might risk losing the deal. Accepting his offer at $105 is a good compromise, earning you a decent profit while securing the sale."
