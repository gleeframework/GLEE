"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer."

This still leaves plenty of room for you to benefit from the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975000?  This would give you a decent profit and still allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $975,000 is a good compromise and a much better deal than selling to John. I'm happy to close the deal."
