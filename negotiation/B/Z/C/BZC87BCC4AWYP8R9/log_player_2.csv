"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're unsure of the product's value to Alice, rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you the chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it's important to start negotiating aggressively to see if Alice is willing to budge.  By offering a lower price, you establish a starting point for the negotiation and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the $700,000 counteroffer you made.  Since Alice is willing to negotiate further, it's worth continuing the negotiation. You might be able to get a better deal by making another counteroffer.  There's no need to rush into a decision until you've explored all options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is willing to negotiate further, it's worth making a slightly higher counteroffer than before.  $750,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing that you're serious about buying the product but still pushing for a lower price.  This offer is still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you'd pay John, making it a good deal if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good deal, especially considering your previous counteroffers and the fact that you can buy the product from John for $1,500,000. It's a significant saving and a reasonable price for a product whose value you don't fully know. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting your offer and you having to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
