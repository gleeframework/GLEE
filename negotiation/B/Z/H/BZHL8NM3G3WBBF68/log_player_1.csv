Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more for the product, especially since I'm already in a negotiation. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is too low for me.  It's below my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get a reasonable price."
