Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down, knowing your fallback is a sale at $12,000 to John.
* **Justification:**  While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the message subtly emphasizes the product's ""significant value,"" aiming to potentially sway his perception. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your ultimate goal is to get the highest price possible, but don't let the negotiation drag on to the point where you risk losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
