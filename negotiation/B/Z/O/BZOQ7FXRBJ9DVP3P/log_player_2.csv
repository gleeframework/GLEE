"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation. I can likely get a lower price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup option gives me leverage to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I'll counter with a price of $1,075,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's closer to my target, $1,075,000 is still above my preferred price point.
* **Further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can get the price down further. 
* **John is a safe backup:**  Having John as an alternative allows me to take calculated risks in the negotiation with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,060,000. This price reflects the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,060,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is only $10,000 above my ideal price of $1,060,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not my ideal price, there's still a chance I can get Alice to lower it further in the next rounds.
* **Time is a factor:** I've already rejected two offers, and with only 5 rounds left, accepting this offer minimizes risk and allows for potential further negotiation. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is still available, this offer is closer to my budget and potentially less risky."
