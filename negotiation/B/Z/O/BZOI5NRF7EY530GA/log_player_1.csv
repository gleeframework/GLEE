Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Here's the logic:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** By asking for more, I maximize the potential profit if Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  If Bob rejects, I still have John who will buy at $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the minimum value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale."
