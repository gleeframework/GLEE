"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would only be worth $8,000 at most for my needs. I could consider an offer closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let me know!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to the middle, but that price is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000, but that's really the highest I can go.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the $7,000 offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
