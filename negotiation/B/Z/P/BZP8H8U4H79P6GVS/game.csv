"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you letting me know about this unique product. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $160 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $160 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $140. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $155 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",155.0,Alice,5,
