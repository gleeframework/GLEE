I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  It's also above John's offer, making it more appealing to Bob."

While $12,500 is a decent price, I can still potentially get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
