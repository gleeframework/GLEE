"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value of $1,500,000, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price, potentially getting closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, but still higher.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get even closer to your target price of $1,200,000. There's a chance she might accept a counteroffer closer to your budget or, if she doesn't, you can always buy from John."

I believe this price is fair considering my budget and your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1320000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is closer to your budget but still higher.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is risky.  She may not budge further, and you risk wasting time.  It's more advantageous to buy from John at $1,200,000, as this guarantees you the product at your maximum budget."
