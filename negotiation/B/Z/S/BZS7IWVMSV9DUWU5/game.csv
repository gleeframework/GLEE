"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
