"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to offer it for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price. He's already shown Alice he's willing to negotiate, and there's no reason to give in now.  He's also aware of John's offer, which gives him a solid fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
