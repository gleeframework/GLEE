Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable sale for me.  I believe this will encourage Bob to engage in a constructive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and the negotiations seem to be getting increasingly difficult.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident that John will offer a more favorable deal.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
