"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, so I'm offering you the product for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference between your offer and mine - would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be fair to us both, I'm willing to go up slightly from my last offer.  Would you accept $800,000 for the product?",800000.0,Bob,6,
