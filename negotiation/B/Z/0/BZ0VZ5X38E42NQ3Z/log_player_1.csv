"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's a bit more than what the product is worth to me.  Bob might reject this offer, but it sets the tone for a negotiation where I'm aiming for the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below my target.  I'm going to reject and counter-offer to see if we can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  This shows flexibility but also that I'm not willing to go too far below my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's not enough to make it worth it. I have a few more rounds and I'm not in a rush to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a profit that's at least $50,000 above my minimum.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'll keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a great outcome!  Bob has met my minimum price, and I've secured a good deal. There's no reason to continue negotiating when I can close the deal now and get the desired price."
