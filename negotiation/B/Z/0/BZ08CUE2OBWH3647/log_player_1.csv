Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, my goal is to maximize profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below this price is not strategic.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it at $950,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and the certainty of John's offer."
