"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. I think it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $120? That's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
