Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I am unable to accept $85 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $95 as a new offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $95 is closer to my budget, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. John is offering the product for $80, which is within my price range. I'll go with John's offer."
