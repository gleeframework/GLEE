Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's close this deal!

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a bit more. Since Alice is already offering the product for $120, which is the same price I can get from John, I'll try to get her to meet me at that price. Here's my message:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
