"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $95?  It's still a good deal for you, and within my budget.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $98? That would be a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $102. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
