Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, who values the product more than you do. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 (closer to Bob's value) leaves room for potential negotiation downwards while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives you leverage. 

By starting the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase your chances of securing a higher sale price while still maintaining a comfortable margin above your minimum."
