"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer starts high, but it's within Bob's range of what he's willing to pay, so it's likely to be accepted. If it isn't, we'll see what Bob's counteroffer is and adjust accordingly. It's a good starting point to try and maximize my profit, but also leaves room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, but still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profit closer to my ideal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hoping to get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate further. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  This is a smaller compromise than before, but still shows I'm willing to negotiate while aiming for a price closer to my ideal. It's a reasonable middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I still have 4 rounds left and I'm not desperate. It's worth trying to negotiate further before settling or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

This offer is a compromise again, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer. With only 3 rounds left, I need to start considering the risk of losing the deal completely if I keep asking for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold, I'm still holding out hope for a slightly better price. There are two rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for $11,000. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a small increase from Bob's offer, but with only one round left, I'm hoping he'll accept it. I'm willing to accept $11,500, as it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the last round, and Bob's offer is $500 more than John's offer.  It's not ideal, but it's still above my minimum threshold.  I'm going to accept it, as I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
