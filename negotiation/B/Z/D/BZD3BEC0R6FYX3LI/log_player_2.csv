"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $7,000 is lower than John's price of $8,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer, potentially saving even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $6800. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, offering $6,800.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $8,000 and closer to Bob's ideal range. It's likely that further negotiation would result in a smaller price reduction, making it more advantageous to accept Alice's offer."
