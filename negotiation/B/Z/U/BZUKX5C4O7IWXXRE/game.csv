"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm able to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
