{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm able to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  To ensure I get my desired value, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
