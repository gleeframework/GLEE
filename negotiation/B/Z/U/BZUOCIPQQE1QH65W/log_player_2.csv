# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120, which is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a great deal considering how much you value this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.
