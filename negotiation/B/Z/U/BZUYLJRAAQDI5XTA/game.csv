"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest in a product that will bring a significant return, and that means I need to be able to acquire it at the right price. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this reflects the value it brings to me, while also allowing you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe my product has significant value that justifies a higher price. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $650,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a fair price given the current market. Let's see if we can close this deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your offer, I'm willing to drop the price to $675,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
