Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's valuation of the product but not unreasonable. It gives you some room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $150. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise, and it's still above the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale rather than risk further negotiation and potential rejection, especially considering John is also willing to buy for the minimum price."
