"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000? This offer reflects the product's unique qualities while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent. While I'm negotiable, accepting $800,000 would be a significant loss for me. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be highly beneficial to you. My final offer is $1,750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.  ",1750000.0,Alice,5,
