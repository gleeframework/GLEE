"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $100 to $95, and now you're asking me to go down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $92.50",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, and I'll offer $91.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",91.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $91, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll offer you a price of $91.25",91.25,Alice,5,
