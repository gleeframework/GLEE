Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $100 to $95, and now you're asking me to go down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $92.50

You have three options:

You've managed to negotiate the price down to $91.25, which is lower than your maximum budget of $100 and still a good deal. Accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
