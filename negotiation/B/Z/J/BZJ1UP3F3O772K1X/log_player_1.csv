Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but also offers Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to the minimum you're willing to accept, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
