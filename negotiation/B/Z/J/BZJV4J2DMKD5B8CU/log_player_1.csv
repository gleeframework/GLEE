Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position. 
* **Uncertainty about Bob's Value:**  Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to gauge his interest. A high starting price will either deter him, revealing his low interest, or encourage him to counteroffer, giving me an indication of his willingness to pay. 
* **The John Option:**  The presence of John as a backup buyer with a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back to John. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profits while also having a fail-safe option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above my minimum acceptable value, I am not willing to settle just yet. Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a higher price. Bob's counteroffer indicates his willingness to pay more than $1,000,000, but it's still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Understanding Bob's Limits:** By rejecting his offer, I can get a better sense of his upper limit. He may be willing to go higher if he truly wants the product.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it's not the most profitable. I'm willing to take a calculated risk by continuing the negotiation to try to achieve a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a better deal without completely losing the opportunity to sell to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,400,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price allows me to test Bob's real limit without pushing him away completely. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't end up selling at a loss. 

By making this counteroffer, I aim to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us and ultimately secures a favorable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is now very close to my desired price point. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and losing the deal entirely is high.  Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to Target:** $1,350,000 is only $50,000 away from my initial offer. This is a good compromise considering the negotiation progress.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate. Bob may not be willing to go higher, and I may not be able to lower my price significantly without compromising my profit margin.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While $1,350,000 isn't the highest possible price, it's a solid outcome considering the risks involved in continuing the negotiation.  The potential of losing the deal completely outweighs the potential gain of a few more thousand dollars."
