"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're willing to start negotiations at $105. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to set the terms and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $105 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasonable offer:** $95 is still within Bob's budget and shows he's serious about buying the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes that Bob is open to further discussion to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. To meet in the middle, how about we offer the product at $100? This is still a good saving for you compared to its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $100 is closer to Bob's target, there's still some room for negotiation. Alice is already willing to move down from her initial price, so there's a good chance she'll come down further.
* **Staying firm on price:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob is serious about getting a good price and isn't afraid to walk away if he doesn't get it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $97.50, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  Bob is increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise but not caving completely.
* **Midpoint approach:**  $97.50 is the midpoint between his previous offer ($95) and Alice's latest offer ($100). This demonstrates a genuine attempt to meet in the middle.
* **Maintaining negotiation:**  The message remains polite but firm, emphasizing that Bob is serious about acquiring the product at a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, how about we settle at $98? This offers a good balance for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $98 is very close to Bob's ideal price point of $95.
* **Little room for improvement:**  Alice has already moved down significantly from her initial price.  Further negotiation might only result in small concessions and could risk Alice walking away from the deal. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob has already used several rounds.  There's a chance Alice might become less willing to negotiate further in the remaining rounds, increasing the risk of losing the deal altogether.

At this point, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of missing out on the product while still securing a good price."
