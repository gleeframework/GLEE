Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's maximum gives him the feeling of getting a deal if he accepts immediately. 
* **Ensure a Profit Above John's Offer:** The offered price is still significantly higher than John's offer ($100), guaranteeing a better profit if Bob accepts.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while having a safety net (selling to John) if Bob rejects the offer."
