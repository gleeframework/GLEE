"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, and I think that's a fair compromise given your original asking price. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
