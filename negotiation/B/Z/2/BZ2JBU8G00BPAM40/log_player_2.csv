"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is offering it at $120.  While this is a decent discount, I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. It's also worth noting that Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's definitely room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for Alice (she's willing to sell for $80). This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer and should encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to pay up to $150 from John, and Alice is willing to sell for $80.  There's still a significant gap, and I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $110. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It's a compromise that could be acceptable to both of us. If Alice rejects again, I'll be prepared to go back to my initial counteroffer of $100 or even consider buying from John if the negotiation stalls."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still closer to my maximum willingness to pay from John than to what Alice is willing to sell for.  I'm confident that I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradual concessions. I'm increasing my offer to $115, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to be easily pressured. If she rejects this offer, I'll be ready to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but it's still not a great deal. I'm only $10 away from John's price, and Alice is still holding out for a price well above her minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final attempt to negotiate with Alice. I'm increasing my offer to $125, which is only $15 less than her current offer and closer to my acceptable range.  If Alice rejects this, I will buy from John.  I've already shown I'm willing to negotiate and compromise, but there's no point in continuing to haggle if she's not willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is only $5 less than John's price. I've tried to negotiate, but Alice is clearly not willing to meet me halfway. There's no point in continuing to haggle, as I'm likely to end up paying more than John's price if I keep going.  I'm better off buying the product from John to avoid any further wasted time and effort."
