Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer without being too aggressive.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize initial profit:**  $9,500 is closer to my desired value of $10,000.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  By not starting too high, I avoid scaring Bob away. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects the offer, it's likely he'll counter with a lower price, giving me the chance to negotiate further. 
* **Secure a backup option:**  Having John willing to pay $10,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Signal my commitment:**  I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Continue the negotiation:**  I can propose a counteroffer and explore if we can find a price that works for both of us.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me confidence to stand my ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're keen on the product, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm looking for something closer to my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,250? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $9,250 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate my belief in the product's value. I emphasize ""fairness"" to appeal to his sense of reason.
* **Maintain Leverage:** This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's initial offer and signals my willingness to negotiate, but it also demonstrates that I'm not going to settle for significantly less than my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $9,000 is a fair offer given my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $9,000, which is still below my desired value.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely this will become a drawn-out process.  

I'm confident that John is willing to pay $10,000, so selling to him is the most sensible choice:

* **Guarantees my target price:**  I'll get the $10,000 I'm aiming for.
* **Saves time and effort:**  Negotiating further with Bob might not yield a better result and would take more time.
* **Minimizes risk:**  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob, even if I continue negotiating.

John represents a sure thing, and I prioritize maximizing my profit and minimizing risk."
