"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  $7,500 is a bit steep for me.  How about $7,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,3,
