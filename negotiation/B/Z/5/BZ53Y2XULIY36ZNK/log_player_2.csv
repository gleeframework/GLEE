Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a lower price:** I'm starting at $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows her I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** $9,000 is still within my budget, but leaves space for potential compromise.
* **Know your fallback:**  Knowing I can purchase from John for $10,000 allows me to confidently push for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my last chance to buy from Alice within my budget. 
* **Meeting her halfway:** By offering $10,000, I'm meeting her halfway from her last offer ($10,500).
