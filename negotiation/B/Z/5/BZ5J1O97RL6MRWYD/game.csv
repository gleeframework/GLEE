"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $110? I'm really hoping to snag this product, so let's see if we can work something out.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $125?  I really want this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I can meet you halfway at $127.50, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",127.5,Alice,5,
