"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110.  This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 less than my previous offer and much closer to my goal than John's offer of $100. I'm going to accept his offer to close the deal."
