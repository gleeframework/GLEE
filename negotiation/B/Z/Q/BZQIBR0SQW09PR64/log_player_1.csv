Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (You have a guaranteed backup offer)
* **Bob's Value:** $800,000 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since the product's value is identical to both of you, you need to create the perception of extra value for Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true value and represents a smart acquisition for someone like you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exceptional product,"" ""unique features,"" and ""smart acquisition"" are designed to subtly influence Bob's perception of value.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **No Mention of John:**  Keeping your backup offer secret maintains your negotiating strength.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $925,000).
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob is likely to counter-offer. Have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go. Remember, walking away with $800,000 from John is a good outcome, so don't feel pressured to accept a low offer."
