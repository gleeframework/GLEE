{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $13,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this premium. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but going higher might scare Bob away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly, but still ensures you get significantly more than his perceived value.
* **Backup Offer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum price."
