Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He initially aimed for $1,300,000 and Alice has countered at $1,350,000, which is a good compromise. It's better than his original goal, and it saves him $150,000 compared to buying from John."
