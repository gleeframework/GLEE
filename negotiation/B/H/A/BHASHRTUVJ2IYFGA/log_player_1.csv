``` 

This offer sets the starting point at the minimum value for me.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed.  If he rejects, I'll see if he makes a counteroffer and then decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? I am willing to pay up to $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product, but $500,000 is far below its true value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above a certain price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target value.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to meet the price of $750,000. I'm looking for a price closer to $600,000. Is there any possibility we could meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $600,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $750,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $700,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a middle ground. I'm still not able to meet the price of $700,000. I believe I can offer $650,000 which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

Bob's offer of $650,000 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation that could drag on. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
