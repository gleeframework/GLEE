Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is higher than Bob's $10,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $11,500 is still above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space to go up or down in price, allowing for a potential win-win scenario."
