Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (Bob's Value - Your Minimum)

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might scare Bob away.  It's about finding the sweet spot.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm prepared to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It emphasizes exclusivity and value to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It allows for potential negotiation downwards while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship is more valuable than maximizing immediate profit, a less aggressive starting price might be wise. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you can then negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
