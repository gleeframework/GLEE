"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value, and while my asking price is $2,000,000, I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is friendly and suggests flexibility. I want Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than walk away immediately. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This high initial offer sets a benchmark and potentially anchors Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I started high, hoping for more, there's no guarantee further negotiation will yield a better outcome. Accepting now secures the sale at my bottom line."
