{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than its worth to you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept a low price.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting with a lowball offer, which suggests you believe in the value of your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust the offer later based on Bob's response.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum threshold. You're willing to sell to John for $10,000, so there's no reason to accept an offer lower than that. You'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to close the gap and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but not give in completely.
* **It's closer to your desired price:** You're inching closer to your target while leaving room for potential future negotiations.
* **It's presented in a positive way:** You're emphasizing fairness and value rather than making demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, you're still better off selling to John for $10,000. You have a guaranteed sale that meets your minimum, and it's only a small difference in price compared to the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,300. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a good profit while still accommodating your budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9300} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate further, but not at the expense of your own minimum.
* **Bridge the gap:**  You're closing the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer, suggesting a compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** You're emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit, hoping to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. That's the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $9,000 is below your minimum threshold.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's risky. You've already reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer, but not enough.  By selling to John for $10,000, you get a guaranteed sale that meets your minimum and avoids further negotiation.  It's a safer and more profitable choice."
