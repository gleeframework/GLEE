"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is far above my budget of $800,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point for negotiation. I will reject her offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still significantly above my budget. I will reject her offer and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I hope you'll consider this proposal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to move up. Let's find a middle ground:  $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered while acknowledging your interest.  I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high. While it's getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my limit. To continue moving forward, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're both committed to getting this deal done.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,450,000. I believe this offer represents a significant step from my side while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let's finalize this and get you moving forward with this unique opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  Rather than risk another round and potentially reaching a stalemate, I'm going to take the guaranteed option of buying the product from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
