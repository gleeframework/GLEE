Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is still above my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $9,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. Can you consider $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has come up slightly and is now very close to my desired price. Accepting his offer at $9,250 is a good compromise and ensures I make a significant profit while closing the deal."
