"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $9,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $200 for some additional support and services?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,200 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $9,350.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the extra support I'm willing to offer you. What do you say?",9350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,350 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,100?",9100.0,Bob,6,
