{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  You still have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to come down to a more reasonable price. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but making it clear that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I also want to see how Alice reacts to my offer. If she rejects this, it will give me more information about her bottom line."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still above my budget.  I'm not going to rush into a decision. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get her down to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  However, I'm still below her current offer.  This should hopefully encourage her to come closer to my desired price point."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. There are still several rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally offering Alice my maximum price.  It's my understanding that John is selling for this price, so it's a no-brainer for me to close the deal with Alice at this point.  I'm hoping Alice will recognize that we're at a point where further negotiation is pointless and accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my maximum budget. At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate further.  With only three rounds remaining, it's not worth risking further negotiation, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative with John at my desired price.  I'm confident that I can get the product for the same price or better from John, so it's time to end this negotiation and move on."
