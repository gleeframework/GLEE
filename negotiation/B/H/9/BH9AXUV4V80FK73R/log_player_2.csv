# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?

While $11,000 is closer to my goal, I'll try pushing a little further. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to try and get closer to $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

Alice is clearly holding firm, and $10,750 is a good price. It's not worth risking the deal by pushing further and potentially having to buy from John at full price."
