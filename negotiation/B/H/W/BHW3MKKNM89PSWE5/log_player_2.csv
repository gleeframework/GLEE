"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is better than John's offer of $800,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's room for Alice to lower her price to meet Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum price point of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation while still showing a willingness to compromise. This approach aims to  get Alice to consider a price closer to Bob's budget, potentially leading to a quicker and more favorable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is within Bob's budget of $800,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer guarantees a purchase of the product at a price that's favorable to him.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and the risk of further negotiations could lead to a situation where Bob ends up paying John's $800,000 price instead."
