Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging Bob's potential higher value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is more than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to reach a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 
This counteroffer increases the price from Bob's offer, but still acknowledges his potential value for the product.  It's a good compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still lower than I want.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer close to Bob's last offer but slightly higher. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible but am still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still giving me a chance to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is now only $20,000 away from my minimum.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's lower offer is too high.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
