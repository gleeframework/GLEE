Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a good starting point. It's a fair price for both of us, offering Bob a discount while still leaving me a profit. 
* The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value Bob will receive.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a price that leaves some room for negotiation. 
* I'm keeping John as a backup option, knowing I can always sell for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I understand he's on a budget, I'm not willing to sell for a significant loss.  I'm going to counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and would still be a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still offering a discount from my initial asking price.
* The message acknowledges his budget concerns while also emphasizing the value of the product. 
* I'm hoping this counteroffer shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is still below my ideal price of $15,000, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 than my previous offer.  Also, there's a chance that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  This price still gives me a reasonable profit, and it seems like Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
