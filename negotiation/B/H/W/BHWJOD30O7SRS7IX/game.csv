"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $800,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $810,000 for the product.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",810000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $810,000. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still firm on $810,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and both of our positions.  It's a significant discount from your original price, and it allows you to still make a profit. I'm confident we can close this deal if you agree to this price.",810000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on $810,000, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $820,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",820000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, we're down to the wire here, and I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still holding firm on $810,000.
