"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $95. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you is $80. I hope you find this offer compelling and decide to make the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $95 is slightly better than her initial asking price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
