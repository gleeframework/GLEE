Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 875000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $800,000? I'm willing to close the deal right now at that price, otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.
