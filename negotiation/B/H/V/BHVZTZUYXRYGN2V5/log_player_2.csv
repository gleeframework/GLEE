"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $800,000? I'm willing to close the deal right now at that price, otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a decision. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that it's still a compromise considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $850,000.  While closer to your ideal price, you have the option to buy from John for $800,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John."
