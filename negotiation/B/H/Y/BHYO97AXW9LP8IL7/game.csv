"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial limitations.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,550,000.  This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, while still ensuring a fair return for my investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to go to $1,300,000, which represents a significant investment on my end.  This offer shows my serious intent to purchase this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in it. Let's continue to work together to find a solution.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see your commitment to acquiring this product, and I want to make this happen.  However, $1,300,000 is still a significant undervaluation of its worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  This offer reflects the value we both recognize in this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I hope you'll consider this fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still beyond my current budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,350,000, which represents a substantial investment for me.  This offer demonstrates my commitment to purchasing this product, and I believe it is a fair and achievable compromise.  Let's find a way to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but we're getting closer.  $1,350,000 is still a significant undervaluation of this product's worth.  To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000.  This offer reflects a fair balance between our respective needs and positions. I believe this is a solid compromise that will allow us to finalize this transaction successfully. Let's make this happen.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
