Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial limitations.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to go to $1,300,000, which represents a significant investment on my end.  This offer shows my serious intent to purchase this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in it. Let's continue to work together to find a solution.

While $1,300,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I need to see if Bob will budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see your commitment to acquiring this product, and I want to make this happen.  However, $1,300,000 is still a significant undervaluation of its worth.

Round 6

# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still beyond my current budget.
