Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive, given the product's worth to him is $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $85 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
