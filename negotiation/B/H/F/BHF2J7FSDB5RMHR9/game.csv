"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $14000, which would be $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find the product is worth it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $14500. Would you be willing to consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $16000 and $14500, which would be $15250. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find the product is worth it.",15250.0,Alice,5,
