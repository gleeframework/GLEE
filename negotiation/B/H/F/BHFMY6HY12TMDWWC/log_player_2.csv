"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still too high. You want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can see you're interested. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $100, which is a good price for Bob. It's within his budget and significantly lower than John's price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price and move on."
