"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that holds significant potential for your business.  My asking price is $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. I understand its value to you may be higher, and I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
