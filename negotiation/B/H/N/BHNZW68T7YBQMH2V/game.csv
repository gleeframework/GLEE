"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11250. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
