{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115 is a good starting point.** It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob.** This encourages him to consider the offer and hopefully accept. 

By starting with this offer, I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a bit of a savvy shopper and I'm looking to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. 

While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I'm still hopeful to get closer to my desired price.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still allows me to make a decent profit and reflects the value of the product for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $105 is a compromise,  higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I want to keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation.
* **Emphasize value:** Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him can encourage him to consider the offer. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  At this point, I'm hesitant to continue the negotiation with Bob.  He seems determined to drive the price down, and further negotiation may not result in a profitable outcome. 

Selling to John for $100 guarantees a secure sale that meets my minimum requirement.  It's a safer choice than risking further negotiation with Bob."
