"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer is well above Bob's perceived value of the product, but I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent sum, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my target. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  This counteroffer represents a significant step down from my initial offer but is still well above Bob's initial offer.  This should encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still far from my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to achieve a better price.  There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession, but I'm still holding firm to a price that reflects the value of the product to me. This counteroffer is still well above Bob's last offer and should show him my commitment to reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, and Bob's offers consistently below my minimum acceptable price, I've decided to sell the product to John. It's important to prioritize achieving my minimum value, and John's offer guarantees that. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price with Bob, this decision ensures I don't risk further losses by continuing to negotiate."
