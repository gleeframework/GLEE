"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, as a compromise. Let's try to make this work!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, $9,500 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - how about $9,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,
