"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his target price of $8,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price, as he can still get the product for $8,000 from John."
