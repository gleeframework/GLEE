"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering buying from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I could consider a price closer to  $650,000."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** Aiming significantly lower than Alice's offer creates room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning a ""tighter budget,"" I provide a reason for the lower offer without revealing my absolute maximum price.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from the original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still quite a bit above John's price. We're getting closer to my limit, but it's worth pushing a little further to see if I can get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By offering $725,000, I'm essentially splitting the difference between her current offer ($825,000) and my previous counteroffer ($650,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards my target price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to a sense of reciprocity in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room to maneuver:** While I'm getting closer to John's price, there's still some buffer if Alice rejects this offer and I need to go up slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has met my bottom line.  There's no point in rejecting her offer and risking her going higher or having to buy from John at the same price."
