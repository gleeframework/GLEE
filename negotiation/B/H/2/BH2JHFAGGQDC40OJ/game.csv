"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I could consider a price closer to  $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from the original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
