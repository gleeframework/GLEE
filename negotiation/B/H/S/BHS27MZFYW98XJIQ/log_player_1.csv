# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,137,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1137500}

This is a good deal for me, given the limited number of rounds remaining and the potential of getting a lower price if I keep negotiating. I'm happy with $1,130,000."
