"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $850,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Valuation Gap:**  Alice values the product at $800,000, and Bob's maximum is $1,000,000. There's a $200,000 gap.  
* **Aggressive Offer:** A counteroffer of $750,000 is a strong opening move, leaving room for compromise.  It's also a big enough discount to make Alice think about accepting. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Alice's Response:** Bob will need to be prepared to negotiate further based on Alice's response to this counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  Bob needs to keep John's $1,000,000 price in mind as a fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's new offer of $825,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price. It's only $25,000 above Alice's own valuation, indicating a potential for a deal.
* **John's Offer:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 would cost Bob significantly more than Alice's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible. Accepting the offer secures a good price with minimal risk. 

**Conclusion:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $825,000. It represents a good compromise and a better deal than purchasing from John."
