"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a significant return on your investment, and it allows me to get closer to the value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
