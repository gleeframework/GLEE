"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  This product offers substantial value that I'm confident you'll recognize.  Would you be willing to consider this adjusted figure?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for this product.  This offer reflects the value I see in it, while staying within my budget.  Let's bridge the gap and come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
