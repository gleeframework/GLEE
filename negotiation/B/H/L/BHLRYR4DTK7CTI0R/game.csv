"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to speak with you about this opportunity. Given the value this product brings, I'm happy to offer it to you at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,200,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $1,150,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be mindful of the true value of this product.  I can go as low as $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
