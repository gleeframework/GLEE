"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to speak with you about this opportunity. Given the value this product brings, I'm happy to offer it to you at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than her own valuation of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation. 
*  It's also significantly below my own maximum of $1,500,000.  
* Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below Alice's offer, but it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.

* My message highlights the mutual benefit of the deal and emphasizes that I'm serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

* I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,200,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $1,150,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
