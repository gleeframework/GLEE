# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you.  I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, at a price that's still very attractive given its value to you.  Let's work together to make this happen.  My price is $1,400,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
