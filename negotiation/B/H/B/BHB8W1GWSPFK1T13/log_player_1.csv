Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I think I can get more if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $15,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll lower the price to $17,500.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my desired price and the negotiation seems to be moving in the right direction. Accepting this offer will secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation rounds that might lead to a lower price or a rejection by Bob."
