"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm excited to discuss this opportunity with you. To kick things off, I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's potential. Can we meet at this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
