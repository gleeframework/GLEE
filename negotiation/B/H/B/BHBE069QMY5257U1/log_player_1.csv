Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's potential. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While negotiating with Bob might eventually lead to a higher price, it's getting risky. Bob is consistently staying below my minimum acceptable price, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at that minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the sure thing with John."
