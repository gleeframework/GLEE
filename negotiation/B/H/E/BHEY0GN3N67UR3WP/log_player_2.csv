Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

While you can still try to negotiate further, Alice is now offering a price that's only $800 above your maximum budget.  It's likely you won't be able to get a much lower price from Alice, and there's always a chance she might reject your next counteroffer. Accepting her offer is the safest choice to ensure you get the product."
