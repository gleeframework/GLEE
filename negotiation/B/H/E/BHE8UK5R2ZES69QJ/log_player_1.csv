Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can confidently aim higher with Bob."
