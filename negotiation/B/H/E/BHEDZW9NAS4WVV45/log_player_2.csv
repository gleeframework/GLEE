"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. This unique item is priced at $950,000, which I believe represents an excellent balance between its worth and the investment you're making. Given its significance to you, I'm confident this offer will be appealing. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's any way I can assist you in making your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more attractive.  You can then see if she'll counter with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving as much as possible.  John's offer acts as a fallback option if negotiations with Alice don't result in a better price."
