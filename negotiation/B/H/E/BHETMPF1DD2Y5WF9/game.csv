"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to the true value of the product, which I believe is worth more to you than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $950000 for it. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $925000 is enough to reflect the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $975000 for it. I'm thinking that's a fair price considering its worth to you. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950000. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but I think $960000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $960000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $980000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. Can you consider that?",980000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $990000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $970000 and $990000. Let's aim for $985000. Can you consider that?",985000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $980000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $982000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",982000.0,Bob,10,
