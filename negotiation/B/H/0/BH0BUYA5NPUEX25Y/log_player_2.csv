# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is closer to your target of $800,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price. Accepting Alice's offer saves you time and ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
