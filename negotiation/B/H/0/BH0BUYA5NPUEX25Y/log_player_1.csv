Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $900,000 leaves some room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum:**  I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so this offer is still within my acceptable range.

I'm hoping to get Bob to accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 875000}
