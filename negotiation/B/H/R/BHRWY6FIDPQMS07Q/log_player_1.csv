**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly anchored at $975,000 and unwilling to budge.  We've reached a point where the negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a $225,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
