Round 3

}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $75 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a final offer from my side. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $85 is tempting, it's still above your $80 maximum budget. You know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. It's better to take the sure thing and save the $5."
