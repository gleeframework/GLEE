"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great price, if I do say so myself, and I think it's a steal considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than that, so it's better to reject her offer."
