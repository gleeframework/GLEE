"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price in that range?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we settle on $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $17,000 for the product. Can we meet at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $14,000. That's the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $15,500. That's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $14,500.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $16,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get a fair price for the product. I'll meet you at $16,250. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,9,
