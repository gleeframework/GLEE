"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm aiming for.  To be fair to both of us, could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, which is my absolute limit. This is a fair offer considering John is also offering me the same product at this price. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
