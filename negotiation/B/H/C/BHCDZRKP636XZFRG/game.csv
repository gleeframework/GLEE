I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $180.,180.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $160. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $160 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $145.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $145 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a price of $155. This is a good compromise that should work for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $150?  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",150.0,Bob,6,
