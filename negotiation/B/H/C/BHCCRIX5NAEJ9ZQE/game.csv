"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
