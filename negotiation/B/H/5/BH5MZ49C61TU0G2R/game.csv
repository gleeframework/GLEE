"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $10500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11500. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Can you meet me at $11250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
