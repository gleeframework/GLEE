"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and my original offer of $7,500. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
