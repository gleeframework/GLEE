"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $22000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know if that's a possibility.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly. I'm truly interested, but $18000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. If you're open to that, I'm ready to move forward. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my last offer of $12000. If you're not able to accept that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
