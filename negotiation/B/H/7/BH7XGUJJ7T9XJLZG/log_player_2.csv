"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is very fair considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than John's price. There's significant room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. Could you do $650,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives us a sense of how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $850,000?  This price still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired range. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

We're getting closer!  This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and our previous one, showing willingness to negotiate but also holding firm on a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price gives you a substantial deal while allowing me to recover some of my investment. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're in a good negotiating position now. Alice is clearly motivated to sell.  Let's push a little further and see if we can get her closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle on $780,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm convinced the product is worth it at that price."",
 ""product_price"": 780000
}
``` 

This offer puts us very close to John's price while still leaving some room for Alice to counter if she's really set on a slightly higher number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $800,000.  This price is a significant compromise for me, but it's a price I can live with. Let's finalize this and move forward! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met our bottom line, matching John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John at this point.  We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
