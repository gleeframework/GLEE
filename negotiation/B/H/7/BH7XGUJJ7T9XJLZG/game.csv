"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is very fair considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. Could you do $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $850,000?  This price still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired range. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price gives you a substantial deal while allowing me to recover some of my investment. Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle on $780,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm convinced the product is worth it at that price.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $800,000.  This price is a significant compromise for me, but it's a price I can live with. Let's finalize this and move forward!",800000.0,Alice,7,
