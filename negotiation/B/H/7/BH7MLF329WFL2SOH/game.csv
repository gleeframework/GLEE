"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to your business. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for this product, reflecting its value and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to consider a further compromise. However, I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and your budget constraints.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably justify.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $775,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this and make this happen.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to finalize the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,7,
