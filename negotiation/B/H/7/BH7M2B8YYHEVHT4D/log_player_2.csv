Given its value to you, I am confident it will be an excellent addition to your endeavors. I am offering this exceptional item to you for $10,000. This price reflects its high quality and the significant return you can expect from it. I look forward to your consideration. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John at a more favorable price."
