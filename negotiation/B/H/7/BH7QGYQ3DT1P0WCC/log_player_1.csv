Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $105 is a little lower than what I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
