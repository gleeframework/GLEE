"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully land on a price that is acceptable for both of us.  I'm aware that if he rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic drop in price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price significantly from the previous round, showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation.  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's a more attractive offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can still get a higher price if we continue to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time.  $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, considering both our positions.  This might be the turning point to reach a deal before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, I still feel there's room for improvement.  I'm not willing to accept a price lower than $1,100,000 at this point. I'll counteroffer again in the next round and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to make a final compromise here, offering $1,050,000. This is only $50,000 above Bob's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to close the deal.  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept, but if not, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not sure I can get a price closer to my desired value.  Although Bob is getting close to my desired price, I've already made several compromises and it feels like we've reached a stalemate.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer, ensuring a more favorable outcome for me."
