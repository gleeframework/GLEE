{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point.  While $860,000 is a substantial sum, accepting it would mean losing out on a potential $340,000 profit. It's in Alice's best interest to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
