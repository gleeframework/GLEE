"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $7,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,000 is a good deal, there's potential to negotiate further and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $6,500?"", ""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also pushing for a lower price. The $6,500 price is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $6,800? It's a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the option of buying from John for $8,000 makes accepting this offer the most logical choice.  A $6,800 price achieves a significant saving compared to both John's price and Alice's initial offer, making it a good deal for Bob."
