"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This establishes my initial position and sets the stage for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm willing to compromise to some extent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'm open to negotiating, his offer is unacceptable. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm not going to settle for anything close to his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,200,000. This shows some flexibility while still leaving significant room for profit. I believe this is a more realistic starting point for negotiation, considering Bob's low initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still too low.  I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers if I want to get closer to my ideal price. I will counter again in the next round, but I will start to consider the option of selling to John if we don't make significant progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,100,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but with time running out, I'm getting closer to considering John's offer.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what I consider a reasonable price, even though it's closer to my desired range.  I'm going to counter again, but I'm also seriously considering John's offer as a backup. With only four rounds left, I need to make a strong push to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer before I seriously consider selling to John. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's increasing offers."
