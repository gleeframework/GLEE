Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. How does a price of $1,100,000 sound?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's buying price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer shows Bob I'm serious about selling and values his potential purchase.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it leaves a small margin for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity, subtly justifying the price."
