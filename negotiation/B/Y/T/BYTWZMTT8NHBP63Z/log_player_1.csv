Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how I'd approach this negotiation as Alice:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Minimum Price:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,500,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have John as a backup who will pay your desired price.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you hold a strong position.  You should aim for an offer that's attractive to Bob but still nets you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 represents a fair deal. This offer is valid for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message confidently positions the product and implies its high value.
* **Strategic Price:** The $1,350,000 price leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to counter) but is still significantly above his perceived value.  It provides a substantial profit margin for you.
* **Time Limit:**  The 24-hour limit creates urgency and encourages a faster decision from Bob.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start with a slightly higher offer, anticipating a counter-offer.
* **Relationship Importance:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly more moderate price, even though you have a guaranteed buyer.

**Remember:**  Even if Bob rejects your initial offer, you're in a strong position.  You can always walk away knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John."
