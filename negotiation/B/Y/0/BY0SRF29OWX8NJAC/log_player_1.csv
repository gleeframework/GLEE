Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $7,500 is significantly below its true value.  Could you do $8,750?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a great investment, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,750. Can you meet me at $8,000? I'm willing to make a serious decision at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher. While we could try to negotiate him a bit higher, we already have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000. Taking the sure thing is the best option at this point to maximize our profit and minimize risk."
