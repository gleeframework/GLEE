"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm sure you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing Bob might counteroffer.  This gives me room to negotiate down while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price.  I want to try and get closer to my minimum of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $95?  That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm not yet ready to settle for less than $100. I believe I can still push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be at least at $97 for this to work for me. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97}
```"
