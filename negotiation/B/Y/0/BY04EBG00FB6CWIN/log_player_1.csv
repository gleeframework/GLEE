Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer gives Bob the impression there might be room to negotiate downwards.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While risky, there's a chance Bob might accept the $12,000, netting you a higher profit than selling to John. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
