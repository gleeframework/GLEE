"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it gives him some room to negotiate further while still being closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price. While $13,000 is a respectable offer, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. We're getting close to a potential deal, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more. This counteroffer is still a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to settle. I want to see if I can get a bit more in the next round.  I'm confident I can get closer to $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is the last offer I'm willing to make.  If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John.  It's a solid price, and I think it's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
