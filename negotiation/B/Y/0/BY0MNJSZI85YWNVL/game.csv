,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to close this deal, but this is my maximum offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you've proposed doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you.  To move us closer, I'm willing to consider $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while recognizing your budget considerations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value to me while staying within my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
