"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and exploring possibilities."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" hinting at the product's worth beyond Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message signals a willingness to negotiate while not immediately revealing your bottom line. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor** Bob's perception of the product's value higher.
2. **Gather information** about Bob's willingness to pay. 
3. **Maintain flexibility** for future rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to close this deal, but this is my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches his stated valuation of the product. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  You have room to negotiate and explore if Bob's ""maximum offer"" has any flexibility.  Selling to John guarantees your minimum, but leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you've proposed doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you.  To move us closer, I'm willing to consider $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while recognizing your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledge Bob's offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Value Emphasis:** Reiterate the product's value, subtly challenging Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer drops substantially from the initial price but remains comfortably above your $1,500,000 minimum. This signals flexibility while preserving room for further negotiation. 
* **Framing as Compromise:** Presenting the price as a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with concessions on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value to me while staying within my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away in future rounds. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
