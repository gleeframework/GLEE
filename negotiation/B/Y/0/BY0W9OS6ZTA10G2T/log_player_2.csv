Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your proposal, but we need to ensure we're getting a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $800,000. This is a good price considering I'm still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. I'm going to accept the offer and close the deal."
