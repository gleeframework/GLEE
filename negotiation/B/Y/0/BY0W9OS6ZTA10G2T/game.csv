"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit too steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits and the value of the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  While I appreciate the offer, $850000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $800000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your proposal, but we need to ensure we're getting a fair price for the product.
