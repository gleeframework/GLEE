Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $150. I believe it leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I won't accept a price that is significantly below my minimum. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still ensuring I make a profit."

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so I'll accept. I'd rather sell to Bob than to John, and this will allow me to continue a potential relationship with him for future transactions."
