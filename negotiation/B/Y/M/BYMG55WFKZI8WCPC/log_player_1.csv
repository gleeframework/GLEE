Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a price higher than both your minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100) leaves room for negotiation. It also allows you to potentially secure a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value of the product ($100).  There's room for negotiation. Selling to John for $100 is a possibility, but it's better to try negotiating with Bob first to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Compromise:**  While $80 is too low, countering with a slightly lower price than your initial offer shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Targeting Value:** $120 is still above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, giving you room to potentially negotiate down while still securing a profit. 
* **Staying Above John:** It's important to aim higher than John's offer ($100) to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** While not ideal, $95 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Minimal Gains from Further Negotiation:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, as he's already close to his perceived value of $100.  
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Pushing further risks Bob walking away, leaving you to sell to John at $100."
