Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,750 is still above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $14,250. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiations with Alice are getting very close to his limit. Even though $14,250 is not a terrible price, it's still above his maximum budget. 

Since John is offering a price within Bob's limit, Bob should choose to buy from John and save some money."
