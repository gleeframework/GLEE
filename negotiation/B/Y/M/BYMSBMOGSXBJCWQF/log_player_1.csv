Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $890,000? This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain from this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $890,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $870,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is negotiating but in smaller increments.  We're still well above Jhon's offer, so the risk is acceptable.  Continuing to counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and maintains the potential for a higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to come down slightly to $885,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 885000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply a little pressure and signal this is a serious offer. By stating it's our final offer, we aim to elicit a decision from Bob.  We're still above John's offer, but the slight concession shows we're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $885,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  He's gone back on a previous ""highest I'll go"" statement and is now too close to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
