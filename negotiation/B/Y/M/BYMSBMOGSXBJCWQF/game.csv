"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is tempting, I know the true value of this product.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $890,000? This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain from this product.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to come down slightly to $885,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",885000.0,Alice,7,
