"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards while still maximizing my profit.  I want to see if I can get close to my target of $1,500,000 before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to consider.  I'm hoping to close the deal within a few more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm still holding out for a better price. I think I can get closer to my target with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm offering $1,450,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price for both of us. If he doesn't, I'm still considering selling to John in the next round if I have to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is too low for me. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's significantly below my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me my target price."
