"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I do want to start with a fair price of $1200000. This is a competitive offer considering the product's worth to you is $800000, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $950000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and your budget constraints.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target.
