"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While I can't go as low as $850,000, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still be a very fair price for both of us, given the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I respect that. Let's split the difference: I'll come down to $887,500.  This is a good compromise that acknowledges your needs while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
