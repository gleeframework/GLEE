I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While $150 is my maximum, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.  There's no harm in trying!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount, hoping to get Alice to budge.  I'm offering $120, which is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $140, which is a good deal for me.  While I'd love to try to get it lower, I don't want to risk losing out on the product completely.  It's only $10 more than my ideal price, so I'll accept."
