"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly more than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to consider a price closer to $700,000, given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",800000.0,Bob,4,
