"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at that price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $140, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $155. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
