"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,100,000 is still too far out of my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This offer reflects the significant value the product holds.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,5,
