"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $900000 is a bit outside my initial price range. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $600000.  This would allow me to stay within my budget and hopefully make this deal work for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably offer right now.  I'm prepared to pay $700000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still get a good deal and me to secure the product without exceeding my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
