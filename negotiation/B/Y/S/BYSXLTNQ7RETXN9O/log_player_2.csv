"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my initial price range. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.  This would allow me to stay within my budget and hopefully make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, but still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to try to push for a lower price again. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably offer right now.  I'm prepared to pay $700,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still get a good deal and me to secure the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, I'm starting to run out of time and the risk of not getting the product at all increases. At this price, I'm comfortable closing the deal and securing the product, especially since it's significantly lower than my maximum budget."
