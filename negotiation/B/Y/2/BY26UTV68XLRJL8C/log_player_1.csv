Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's closer to my ideal price. I'm going to accept it and close the deal."
