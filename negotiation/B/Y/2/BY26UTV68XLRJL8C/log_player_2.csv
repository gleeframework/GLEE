"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price. While buying from John guarantees you the product, it's not the most cost-effective option.  Negotiation with Alice has the potential for a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price still allows for a decent profit for me, while being within your budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, you can still potentially save more by continuing to negotiate. You're closer to your desired price, and rejecting this offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to go even lower. Buying from John at this point would be a less desirable option."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
