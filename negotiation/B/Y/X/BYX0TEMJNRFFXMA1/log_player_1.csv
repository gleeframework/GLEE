Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm aiming to get as much as possible, but also understand that a higher starting price might scare him off. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $15,000 is better than selling to John, but I believe I can get more from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a good profit margin for me. I hope this will be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,500 is a solid deal.  It's significantly higher than selling to John, and it seems likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without guaranteeing a higher price."
