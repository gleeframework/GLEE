"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, you can still potentially save more money by negotiating further.  There is room for Alice to lower her price, as she values the product at $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering my valuation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's still higher than your desired price, but it's lower than her initial offer and closer to your valuation.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you significantly lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product at a reasonable price without risking the opportunity cost of losing it to another seller."
