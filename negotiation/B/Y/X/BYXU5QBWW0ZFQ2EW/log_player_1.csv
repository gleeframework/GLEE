I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, giving me a decent profit. However, it's still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay if he values the product highly. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a sale entirely."
