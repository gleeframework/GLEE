"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is unfortunately far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your budgetary constraints. To find a mutually agreeable point, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,750,000. I believe this still reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still beyond my current budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
