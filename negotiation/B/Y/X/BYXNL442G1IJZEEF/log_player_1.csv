Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is significantly more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to counter, potentially settling somewhere in the middle, maximizing my profit.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I'm not afraid to walk away.  The knowledge that I can get $1,500,000 from John gives me leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and also less than the value I know the product holds for him. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows his interest in the product.  I can use this to my advantage by making a counteroffer.
* **Leveraging John:**  I have John as a backup, which allows me to be firm in my negotiations and not feel pressured to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profitable deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing the fairness of the offer.
* **Building Momentum:**  I'm keeping the negotiations moving forward, hoping to reach an agreement before Bob changes his mind or walks away."
