"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Would you be willing to meet at $850,000? This is a significant compromise on my end.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, this is a good product and I respect that you're trying to find a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
