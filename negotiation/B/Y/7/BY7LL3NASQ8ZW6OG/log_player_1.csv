Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, considering my budget and the current market conditions, I am comfortable sticking to my maximum offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge beyond $10,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a better offer. Since John offers a guaranteed $10,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to him now rather than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
