"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can aim for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit:** $9,000 is only $500 more than Bob's maximum price of $8,500.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not come down further, and Bob could end up paying the full $8,000 to John. 
* **Time is a factor:** Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting the offer now ensures a quicker purchase. 

While it's not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic move in this round to avoid a higher cost or losing the deal completely."
