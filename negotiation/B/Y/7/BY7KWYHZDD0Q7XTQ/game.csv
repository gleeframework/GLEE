"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go for now.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your interest in the product. Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $937,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,
