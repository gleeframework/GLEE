Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information you've provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the right hands.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his maximum.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (while true, as you have John) encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming just below Bob's valuation makes the offer seem immediately attractive and potentially avoids him countering with a much lower offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. If he's more agreeable, this offer might be spot on. 
* **Market Demand:** The fact that you have John as a backup suggests the market might not be flooded, giving you leverage.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
