I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still believe the product is worth more than $1,400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price slightly above his last offer.  It's getting risky, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer but still below my ideal price.  I'm trying to show flexibility while still aiming for a profit.  If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm not sure Bob is willing to budge further.  I'll take John's offer of $1,200,000 to avoid the risk of losing even more money."
