{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $600,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for some back and forth.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is positive and inviting, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, gradually lowering my price. 
* If the negotiation drags on or gets frustrating, I'll walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.** While I'm open to negotiation, $600,000 is far too low. 
* **I need to push back and try to find a middle ground.**  Accepting his offer would leave me far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  If the negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always walk away and sell to John for my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still acknowledging his lower valuation. 
* I'll keep in mind my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and try to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $600,000 is quite low, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's significantly higher, but still closer to his perceived value. 
* **Finding middle ground:** This price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and focusing on the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Assess Bob's reaction.** If he rejects again, I'll need to decide if I want to lower my price further or sell to John.
* **Stay firm on my minimum acceptable price.** I won't go below $1,500,000, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation within that range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle somewhere around $700,000? This would be a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's getting closer to my initial counteroffer, $700,000 is still far below my desired price and significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **The negotiation is becoming more challenging.**  Bob's offers are getting closer, but not enough to make it a worthwhile deal for me.
* **Selling to John is still an attractive option.** I'm not willing to risk losing too much money by accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my desired price. 
* I'll keep in mind that selling to John is always a viable alternative if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* I'll need to consider if I'm willing to invest more time in negotiating with Bob or if it's better to move on to a sure thing with John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $700,000 is still too far below my acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** My message emphasizes that this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Focusing on finality:** I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to consider this as a potential end to the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Assessing Bob's response:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John.  His price is significantly higher and would guarantee my minimum acceptable profit.
* **Weighing my options:** I'll need to decide if I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob or if the risk of losing more time is too high."
