"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can do better than $10,000. You have a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000, so there's no reason to accept anything higher than that.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. Since you can buy the product from John for $8000, this counteroffer gives Alice some incentive to negotiate while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You can get the product from John for $8,000. Keep negotiating with Alice, as you're getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, but at $9,800, it's still not worth it.  You have a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000, so it's better to take that option and avoid further negotiations."
