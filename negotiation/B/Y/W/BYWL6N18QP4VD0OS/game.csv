"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering our both sides.  Let me know if you're willing to agree.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",975000.0,Bob,6,
