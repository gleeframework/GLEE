Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to you, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob counters. 
* **Strong Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""return on investment"" adds perceived value for Bob.

**Important Note:**  While aiming high is good, it's crucial not to alienate Bob with an unreasonable initial offer. This approach finds a balance between aspiration and realism."
