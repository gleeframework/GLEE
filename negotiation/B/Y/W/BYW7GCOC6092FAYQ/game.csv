"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,400,000? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm really not comfortable going below $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from what I originally wanted, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers.  The choice is yours.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
