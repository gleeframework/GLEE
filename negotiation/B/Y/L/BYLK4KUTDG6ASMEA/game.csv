This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. Let me know if this works for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $825000. Would you consider $800000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,
