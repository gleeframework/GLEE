"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant amount, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is serious about purchasing the product.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm comfortable starting high and seeing if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  I want to see how committed he is to getting this product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is only $250,000 less than my initial asking price, and it's significantly higher than what John is offering. I'm comfortable accepting this offer to ensure a sale and a good profit."
