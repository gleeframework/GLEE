"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but  I believe my initial offer is closer to reflecting the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for your specific needs.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This offer represents a significant value proposition for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. It seems we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers? I'd be willing to sell for $875,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $862,500. However, I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. That's my final offer.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure we reach a deal that works well for both of us. Let's try this - $850,000.  This feels like a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John.",800000.0,Bob,8,
