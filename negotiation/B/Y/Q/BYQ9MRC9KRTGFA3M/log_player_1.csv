"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155?"", ""product_price"": 155}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $140 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $140 is still a $20 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations has no guarantee of Bob increasing his offer significantly. He might be firm at $140. 
* **John as Backup:**  While John offers $150, securing a deal now with Bob avoids any potential delays or complications that could arise from waiting. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $140 guarantees a reasonable profit with minimal risk."
