Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm offering Bob the product for $15,000.  This is the price I would receive from John if Bob rejects the offer.  There's no incentive for Bob to accept this price, as it's higher than the value he places on the product.  However, this strategy maximizes my potential earnings, as I'm guaranteed to receive $15,000 regardless of Bob's decision."
