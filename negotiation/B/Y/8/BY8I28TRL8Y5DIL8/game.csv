"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,150,000?  This leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm willing to be flexible.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I hope we can close the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,100,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
