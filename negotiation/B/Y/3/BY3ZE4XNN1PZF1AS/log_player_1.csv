Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with an offer of $18,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a higher price initially gives me more room to negotiate and potentially earn a better price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to me emphasizes its potential worth to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly signals that I'm open to discussing the price, which encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Note:**  This is a starting point.  The actual offer will be adjusted based on Bob's responses and my understanding of the product's market value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $18000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $13,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John would leave me with a smaller profit than I could potentially get by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's unique value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I again emphasize the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** The message encourages Bob to consider the offer and potentially counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
