"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at $150, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open."
