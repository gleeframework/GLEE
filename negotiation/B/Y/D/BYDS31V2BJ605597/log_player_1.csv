Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount, incentivizing him to buy, while you gain $19 more than selling to John. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
