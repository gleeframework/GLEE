Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Higher than minimum:** It's above my minimum of $100, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **Not too high:** I want to be attractive to Bob, so I'm not starting at a price that seems unreasonable.
* **Friendly tone:** I want to build a rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider my offer.

I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to figure out how much he values the product and make a counteroffer accordingly.  I'll also keep John's offer of $100 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Value for me:** $120 is still above my minimum of $100, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $150. 
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's room for a counteroffer. Bob has shown interest, and I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not ready to settle just yet.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

Here's the breakdown:

* **Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.  $135 is a good middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us.
* **Messaging:** I'm still maintaining a positive and friendly tone.  I want to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to continue. 

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to re-evaluate.  I'll consider how determined he seems to be and whether I want to lower my price further.  Of course, I'll also keep John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Close to my target:** While $125 is lower than my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $100.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** I've already made a few counteroffers, and I don't want to risk going back and forth for too long. There's a chance Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with John's offer.
* **Potential for future business:**  By accepting this offer, I'm establishing a positive relationship with Bob.  He might be a potential customer for future products I have.

While I'm a little disappointed not to get closer to my initial asking price, I've achieved a successful negotiation and secured a good deal."
