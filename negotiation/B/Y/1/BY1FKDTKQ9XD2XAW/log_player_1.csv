{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 110}
