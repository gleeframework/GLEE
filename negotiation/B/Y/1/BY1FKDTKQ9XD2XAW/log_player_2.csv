"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is within Bob's budget and a better deal than John's $150.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer ensures he gets the product at a decent price without risking losing it to John."
