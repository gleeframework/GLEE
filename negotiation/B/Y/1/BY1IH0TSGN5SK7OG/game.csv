"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $11,000? I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $12,000? I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still open to negotiating.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000.  Would you consider $11,500? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,250? I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're nearing your minimum, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've made a big concession already, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's make a deal.",12000.0,Alice,9,
