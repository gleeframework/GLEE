"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $750,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 10 rounds to try and get a better deal. It's too early to commit at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest.  $600,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it allows for some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $700,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has several rounds left to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she rejected his counteroffer. Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $650,000. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise but also demonstrates that he's still seeking a better deal than $700,000. This approach is more likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's target price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, he only has 5 rounds left. The risk of continuing is that Alice might become less willing to negotiate or even increase her price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise that saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
