"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Alice, it emphasizes the ""immense value"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""a fair starting point for negotiations"" signals to Bob that you're open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. This knowledge empowers you to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need you to come down significantly. How about we start at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for you. It's clear that there's room for negotiation, so rejecting this offer and presenting a counteroffer is the best strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair outcome for both parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  Alice's counteroffer reduces the price by $150,000, showing flexibility.  It's still well above both her minimum and Bob's stated value, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob he's getting something worthwhile.
* **""Middle Ground"" Language:**  By framing the counteroffer as finding a ""middle ground,"" Alice encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly reasonable move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still pretty far apart.  While I believe this product has value, $1,300,000 is not a reasonable price point for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This offer reflects the seriousness of my interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $950,000 is still substantially less than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Bob's message suggests a willingness to negotiate further, so rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's be transparent â€“ I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable solution. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as anything less wouldn't be fair to me."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:**  Alice introduces a sense of urgency by mentioning the other buyer (John). This is a strategic move to nudge Bob closer to a decision.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is her final offer, Alice emphasizes the need for Bob to respond seriously. 
* **Slight Concession:**  The price reduction to $1,250,000 is minor, showing firmness while still exceeding Alice's minimum.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Framing the final offer as a matter of fairness attempts to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potentially make him more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. My final offer is $1,075,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,075,000, while higher, is still significantly below your minimum of $1,200,000.  He has also labeled it as his ""final offer,"" suggesting limited room for further negotiation.
* **Time Investment vs. Guaranteed Offer:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of reaching no agreement, costing you valuable time. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** By continuing with Bob, you're potentially losing other opportunities to sell the product, especially if John's offer is time-sensitive.

**It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John.**"
