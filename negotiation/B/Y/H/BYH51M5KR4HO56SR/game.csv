"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need you to come down significantly. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair outcome for both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still pretty far apart.  While I believe this product has value, $1,300,000 is not a reasonable price point for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This offer reflects the seriousness of my interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's be transparent â€“ I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable solution. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as anything less wouldn't be fair to me.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. My final offer is $1,075,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
