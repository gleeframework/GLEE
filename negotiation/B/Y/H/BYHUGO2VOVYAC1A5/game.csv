,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
