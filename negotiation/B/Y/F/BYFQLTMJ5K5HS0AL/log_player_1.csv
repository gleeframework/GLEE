"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $12,000. It's worth every penny, and I believe you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the deal within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I believe there's room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to continue the process and explore higher prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9,500 isn't quite enough for me to let go of this product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
