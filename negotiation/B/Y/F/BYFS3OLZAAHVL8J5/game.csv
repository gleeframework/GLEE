"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.",8500.0,Bob,4,
