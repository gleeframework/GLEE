"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm starting with a lower price to give myself room to negotiate.  
* **Not too low:**  $7,000 is still a decent amount of money and shows I'm taking the offer seriously. 
* **Clear communication:** The message explains my reasoning and sets the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I can continue negotiating and see if I can get Alice closer to my target price.  I'm still within my 10 rounds and haven't reached the point where buying from John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm inching closer to Alice's offer but still keeping it below my maximum budget.
* **Reasoning:**  The message reiterates my willingness to buy while highlighting the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Setting the stage:**  I'm making it clear that I'm serious about buying but also setting a limit to my negotiation range."
