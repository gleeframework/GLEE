"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's offer of $120, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There are 10 rounds, so Bob has time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $107 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $107 is within Bob's budget of $120 and is a better deal than John's offer of $120.  It's also likely that Bob won't be able to get a significantly lower price by continuing to negotiate, as Alice has already moved from her original $110 offer.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a decent price while saving time and effort in further negotiation."
