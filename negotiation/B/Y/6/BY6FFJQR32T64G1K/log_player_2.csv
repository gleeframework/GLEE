Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget than her previous offer, it's still above his target. He should try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, and it seems unlikely she'll go lower.  John offers a price that fits within Bob's budget, making him the better option."
