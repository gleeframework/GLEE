"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal and get this product in my hands.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
