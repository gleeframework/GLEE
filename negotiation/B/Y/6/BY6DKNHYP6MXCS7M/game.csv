"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $135 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $137.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $129. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $132. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $132 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle one more time. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm starting to think it's time to consider other offers.",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you at $125 one last time. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Bob,10,
