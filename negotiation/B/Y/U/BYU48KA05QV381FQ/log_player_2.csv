"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product for less from Alice, or you can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer again.  While $11,000 is closer to my limit, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  If it doesn't work, I can always buy from John."
