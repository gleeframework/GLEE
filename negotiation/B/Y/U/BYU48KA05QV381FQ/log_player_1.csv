This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 
I'm counter-offering Bob at $11,000. This is still above his offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'd rather sell to John for $12,000."
