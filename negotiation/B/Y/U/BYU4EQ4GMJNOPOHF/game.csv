"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $550,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $450,000? That would work much better for me.",450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $475,000 to try and find a middle ground.  Do you think that would work?",475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $475,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $525,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to make one last offer at $485,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll need to explore other options.",485000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $485,000. I'm willing to make one last compromise and offer the product for $510,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",510000.0,Alice,9,
