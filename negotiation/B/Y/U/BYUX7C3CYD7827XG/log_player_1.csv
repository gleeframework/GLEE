"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my goal of $8,000. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out.  While I agree the product looks great, $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I want to maximize my profits, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering a slightly reduced price from my initial offer, but still above Bob's perceived value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more. I'm also reiterating my desire to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway and settle on $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than my goal.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,250 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and go with $7,625? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7625}
```

I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price than his last offer. I'm also highlighting the fairness of the offer to hopefully convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could go up to $7,400, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $8,000.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and it's becoming clear that we're not going to agree on a price that works for both of us.  I'm running out of time, so it's best to sell to John for $8,000 to avoid losing any more money."
