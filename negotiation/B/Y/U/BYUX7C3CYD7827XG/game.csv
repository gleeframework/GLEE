"Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out.  While I agree the product looks great, $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway and settle on $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,250 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and go with $7,625? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",7625.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could go up to $7,400, but that's as high as I can go.",7400.0,Bob,6,
