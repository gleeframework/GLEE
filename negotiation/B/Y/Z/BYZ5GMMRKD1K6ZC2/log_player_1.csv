Round 2

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there is room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can try to secure a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is my best price.  This is still a significant discount from my initial asking price and a great opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. There are still several rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'm confident I can get a better offer than $1,325,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I am still hoping to get a better deal. I am confident that we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I don't want to sell to John yet as I can potentially get a higher price from Bob."

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation has stalled.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and there's a high chance that we won't be able to reach a deal in the next round.  To avoid the risk of getting a lower price or no deal at all, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a guaranteed profit and meets my minimum expectation."
