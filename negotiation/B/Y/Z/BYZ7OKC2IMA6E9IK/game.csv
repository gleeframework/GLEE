"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $2000000.  I believe its value to you could be substantial, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. While I am interested in the product, $2000000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. $800000 is significantly below what I need to part with this product.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1500000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is the absolute maximum I can pay. If you are not willing to accept this offer, I will have to go with John's offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
