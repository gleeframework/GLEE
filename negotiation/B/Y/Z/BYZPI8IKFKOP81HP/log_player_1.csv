Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Openness to negotiation:** By expressing a willingness to discuss, you encourage Bob to engage in the conversation, increasing your chances of a successful sale at a price above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your guaranteed selling price to John. If Bob had that information, he would be in a stronger position to negotiate you down."
