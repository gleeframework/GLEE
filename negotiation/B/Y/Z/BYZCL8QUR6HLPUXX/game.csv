"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $90? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $87.50 is still too low for me.  How about we compromise at $89?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $89. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $89, which would be $88.25. Can you consider that?",88.25,Bob,6,
