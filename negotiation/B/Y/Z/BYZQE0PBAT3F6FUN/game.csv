"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to me is much higher.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $9,000 again, or even $9,250? I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our negotiation and appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 one last time. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,8,
