"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the unique value of the product. However, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. I can see that $1,250,000 is a good midpoint between our initial offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
