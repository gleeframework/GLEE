Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  I'm also keeping John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything below my minimum price of $800,000.  I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $850,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer.  If he rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John, as $800,000 is my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't think we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  I'm going to take John's offer of $800,000, which is my minimum."
