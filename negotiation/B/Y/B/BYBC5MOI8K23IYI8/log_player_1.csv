Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below that is pointless.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Confidence:**  Presenting a confident opening offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
