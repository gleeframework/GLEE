"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
