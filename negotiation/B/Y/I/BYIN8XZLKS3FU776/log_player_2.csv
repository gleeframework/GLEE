"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to see how much negotiating room there is. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to get as close to $8,000  below my maximum budget as possible. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counter-offer leaves space for Alice to counter, and for me to potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $6,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice has come down significantly, but her offer of $8,500 is still slightly above John's price of $8,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, especially if I hold firm. I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. $8,500 is closer, but I was really hoping to keep it around $7,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between Alice's current offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($6,500). This shows willingness to compromise but keeps me below my maximum.
* **Final Attempt:** This counteroffer is a good balance between seeking savings and potentially securing the deal with Alice. If she rejects this, I'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:** Alice has finally matched John's price of $8,000. There's no further benefit to negotiating, as I can't get a lower price from John. 
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at the best possible price without risking further negotiation."
