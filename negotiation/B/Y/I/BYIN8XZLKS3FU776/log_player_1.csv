{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances your desire to maximize profit with the possibility of losing Bob as a buyer. 

* **$10,000 is above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **$10,000 is below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and even lower than what I initially offered him. I'm not willing to sell it for that low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $6,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give away the product for a fraction of its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. $8,500 is closer, but I was really hoping to keep it around $7,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to what I'm willing to accept, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a final agreement."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
