Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find highly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** By offering the product at $1,500,000, you leave room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit margin. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as highly valuable or scarce. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can always adjust your price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) during negotiations."
