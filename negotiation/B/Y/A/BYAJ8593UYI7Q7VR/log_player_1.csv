Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating, which might make Bob more likely to engage. 

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any) or his rejection.  I'll keep John's offer of $100 in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob stall or go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.**  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for less than my minimum.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can secure a guaranteed sale with John for $100.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum.  I'll aim to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate you're interested.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  That gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $95 splits the difference between my initial offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm using positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value by mentioning ""a good deal"" for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his decision. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to decide whether to further reduce my price or sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.**  I'm unwilling to go lower than my minimum, even though I want to make a sale.
* **John's offer provides a guaranteed $100.**  This is a much better option than accepting Bob's offer and getting $85.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll move forward with selling the product to John, as it's the best option available to me at this point."
