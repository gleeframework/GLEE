"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can find a middle ground. This is a good price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $7,000 is closer, but still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $8,250? That's my final offer.",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8,250 is getting closer, I need to be at $8,400 to make this worthwhile for me.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",8400.0,Alice,7,
