"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point for the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation and demonstrates my interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can find a middle ground. This is a good price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to a reasonable price, I still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price closer to my target while still leaving some room for negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $7,000 is closer, but still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to pay, but I know I can get it for $8,000 from John.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $8,250? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

This counteroffer makes a small concession while establishing a firm limit and suggesting this is my best and final offer to encourage Alice to accept. If she rejects it, I will take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8,250 is getting closer, I need to be at $8,400 to make this worthwhile for me.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to budge from her final offer of $8,400. It's time to exercise my option to buy from John for $8,000 and save the extra money."
