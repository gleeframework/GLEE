"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to prompt Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  I'm not going for the full $15,000 initially because I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. If the negotiations don't work out, I can still sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's also significantly below the initial offer I made.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** Even though Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's still interested. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can find a middle ground. This is a good price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm proposing $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Justification:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good price"" for both of us to maintain a positive negotiation tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $7,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left to negotiate a higher price, and I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting this offer keeps my options open and ensures I don't settle for a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $7,000 is closer, but still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by lowering my price again.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""closer to an agreement"" to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  $8,500 is a significant jump from $7,000, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $8,250? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $8,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Even though we're close, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **Room for counter-offer:** I have 4 rounds left, and Bob has declared his final offer, so it's time to counter and see if we can close the gap.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting this offer keeps my options open and demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8,250 is getting closer, I need to be at $8,400 to make this worthwhile for me.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm declaring this as my final offer to signal to Bob that further negotiation might not be possible.
* **Small Increase:** I'm raising the price slightly to push for a better deal, but not going too high to risk losing Bob. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm highlighting the compromise to make the offer sound reasonable.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm urging Bob to close the deal to encourage him to accept my offer."
