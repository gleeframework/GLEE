"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John is selling it for $1,000,000.  
* **It's within Bob's budget:**  The offer of $900,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. 

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save $100,000."
