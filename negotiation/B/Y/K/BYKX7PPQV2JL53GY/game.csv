"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. I'm confident in the product's value and believe a price closer to $2,100,000 is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $2,050,000 is the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",2050000.0,Bob,4,
