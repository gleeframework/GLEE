"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
