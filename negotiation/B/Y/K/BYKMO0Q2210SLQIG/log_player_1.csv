{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. This brings us closer to the value I place on it, while still allowing you to make a profit. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's best to sell to him to secure the best possible outcome for myself."
