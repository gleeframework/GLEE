Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob. If Bob rejects, you'll have the opportunity to either counter-offer or accept his counter-offer depending on the price he suggests.  Keep in mind John's offer of $80 as your safety net if negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. You want to see if you can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a significant step up from my last offer, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$95 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
