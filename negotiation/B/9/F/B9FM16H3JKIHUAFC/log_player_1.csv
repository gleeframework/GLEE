{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting the product's value to you. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still potentially securing a profit for you.  Remember, you have a safety net with John, so you can always walk away if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept $14,000,  it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price. You can use John's offer as a baseline for your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $14,000 is a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?  This gives us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $15,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While you could try to push for a bit more,  accepting his offer is a good move.  It's a profitable sale, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
