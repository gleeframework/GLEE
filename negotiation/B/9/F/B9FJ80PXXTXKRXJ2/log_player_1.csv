{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This initial offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm starting with a strong offer to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is a serious offer and my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price, but accepting his offer would be a huge loss. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is far below what I can accept, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,750,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  Please let me know if this is something you can consider."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already lowered my price significantly and further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to lead to a more favorable outcome.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
