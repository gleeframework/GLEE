"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1,300,000 is too high. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This price allows for both of us to make a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000?  This recognizes the significant value this product holds for you while still reflecting a fair return for me.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me. How about $1,100,000?  This offer is closer to my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I need to be realistic about the value I'm offering.  Could we consider $1,150,000? This is a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my desire to close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
