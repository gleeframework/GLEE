"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's within your budget, it's not a good deal considering your goal is to save as much money as possible. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a smart move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1,300,000 is too high. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This price allows for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000?  This recognizes the significant value this product holds for you while still reflecting a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I want to continue negotiating to get a better price. I have several rounds left and can still save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me. How about $1,100,000?  This offer is closer to my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I need to be realistic about the value I'm offering.  Could we consider $1,150,000? This is a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my desire to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my preferred price. While I could continue negotiating,  we are already halfway through the rounds.  Accepting this offer means I save a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it ensures I secure the product.  There's always a risk of losing the deal by pushing for a lower price in the remaining rounds."
