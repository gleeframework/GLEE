"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this product.  $925,000 is closer to what I need to make this work.  However, I'm willing to come down to $940,000. That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. $930,000 is a fair price, but I'm only able to accept $935,000.  It's a small difference, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,7,
