Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up a little, getting me closer to my desired minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still a ""deal"" if he's interested in the product. It creates a sense of value and urgency. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible outcome with Bob, knowing I have John as a reliable backup."
