"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $140 is too high, as Bob values the product at $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, but still above Alice's value of $120. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still potentially making a profit. This counteroffer also demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going down to 130. How about we meet in the middle at 135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $135 is within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that is lower than John's price, while still leaving some room for Alice to make a profit.  It's also a reasonable compromise in the negotiation."
