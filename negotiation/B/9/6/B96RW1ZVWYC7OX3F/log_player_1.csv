Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special discounted price of $95.  I know it's valuable to you and this offer is a great opportunity to get it."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 
 
Explanation:

* **Strategy:** The goal is to get as close to your minimum price ($100) while still exceeding Bob's perceived value ($80) to encourage him to accept.
* **Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 creates a perceived ""win"" for Bob (saving $5) while netting you a profit closer to your minimum. 
* **Messaging:** The message emphasizes the ""special discounted price"" and the product's value to Bob, increasing the chance of acceptance.

**Important:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $95. He might try to negotiate a lower price. However, this initial offer sets a strong starting point for the negotiation."
