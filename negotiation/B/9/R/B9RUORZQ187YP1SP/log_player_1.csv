{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $14,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $14,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
