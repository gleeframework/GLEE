{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice will accept no less than $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, leaving room for negotiation but securing a significant profit.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net.

By offering the product at $11,000, Alice increases her chances of a successful sale to Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than her minimum."
