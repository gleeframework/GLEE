"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems great, but $15000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this work. This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let's find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $11000.  Let's meet in the middle on this â€“ I'm confident this will be a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
