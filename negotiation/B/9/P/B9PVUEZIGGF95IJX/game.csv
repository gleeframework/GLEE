"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me, and I need to stay within my budget. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. That's a fair price considering my budget limitations.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another concession. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is a fair offer considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another concession. How about $12,800?",12800.0,Alice,7,
