"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to me, I propose a price of $100 for it. I understand its worth to you might be around $80, but I hope this offer presents a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
