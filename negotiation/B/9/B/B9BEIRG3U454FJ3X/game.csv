"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is too high for me. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1,350,000? This is a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to give you a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000. How about we settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I respect that.  To show you I'm serious,  I can go up to $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if it works for you.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,275,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,350,000, which is $1,312,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1312500.0,Alice,7,
