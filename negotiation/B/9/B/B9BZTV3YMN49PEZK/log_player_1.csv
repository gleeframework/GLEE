"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too outrageous. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a decent price, I'm aiming for more.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still staying above Bob's perceived value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,800 is closer to my minimum but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's last offer and still significantly above my minimum. I'm getting closer to his perceived value, but I'm hoping he sees the potential of the product and is willing to go a little higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly close to my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds and it's unlikely he'll go higher. At this point, John is offering my minimum price and it's a secure sale with no more negotiation.  I'll choose to sell to John and avoid further rounds."
