"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point while also signaling my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $925,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves room for Bob to make a counter-offer if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I have several rounds left and there's a chance we can find a mutually acceptable price that's higher than $875,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000, meeting Bob halfway from the previous round. This shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to what I could get from John, I'm not giving up yet. I've already rejected offers closer to my minimum, and I still have a few rounds left to try and reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again, offering $875,000. This is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob before potentially selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is only slightly better than what John is offering.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and getting no deal is too high.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
