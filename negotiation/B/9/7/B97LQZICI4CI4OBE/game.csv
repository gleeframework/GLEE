"Thanks for your offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
