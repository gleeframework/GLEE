{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always best to start by rejecting an offer that's out of your range.  You can then counter-offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, my budget for this purchase is capped at $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, given the unique value and capabilities of our product, I'm unable to reduce the price below $1500000. It would be a significant loss for us to sell it for less than its true value. Let's explore if there might be other terms or conditions that could make this transaction more feasible for both parties.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to negotiate below her initial asking price of $1,500,000. This is well above your budget, and further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price you're comfortable with.  Therefore, the most sensible option is to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget."
