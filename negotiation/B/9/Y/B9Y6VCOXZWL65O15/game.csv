"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm really hoping to close this deal and think this price would work for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
