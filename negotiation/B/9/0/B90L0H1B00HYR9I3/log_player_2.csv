"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is significantly above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to $800,000. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget.  It's worth one more counteroffer to try and push Alice further down.  If this fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even though she's coming down in price.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high.  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he could end up with no deal and no product.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000 and move on."
