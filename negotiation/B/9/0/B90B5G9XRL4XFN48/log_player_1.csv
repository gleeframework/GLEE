Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a quick deal. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down but always keep John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $70. Would you be willing to consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $80. I will reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $75? It's still a good deal for you and closer to what I need. "", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to a price closer to $65 if possible. This would allow me to make the purchase without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $65 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that we're far apart in our desired prices.  Rather than waste more time, I'll take John's offer of $80, which is my minimum acceptable price and a guaranteed sale."
