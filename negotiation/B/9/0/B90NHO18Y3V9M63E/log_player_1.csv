Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm happy to buy the product for $13000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
