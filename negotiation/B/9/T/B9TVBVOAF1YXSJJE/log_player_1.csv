{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a good compromise - it's more than my minimum but still below Bob's full value. This opens the negotiation in a positive way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't justify spending $10,000 on it at this time. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 isn't quite enough for me at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to justify spending $9,000 on the product. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer and is only $500 below my ideal price.  I'll accept it to avoid further negotiation."
