"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $900000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950000? This still leaves me room for a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about we settle on $920000?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While I'm getting closer to your price,  $920000 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise one last time at $935000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth.  What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
