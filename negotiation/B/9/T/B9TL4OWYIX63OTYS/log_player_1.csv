{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since I have a backup buyer in John, I can be confident in rejecting any offers below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $85 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my asking price. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I understand your position, but I can only commit to $90 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a deal closer to my goal of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $97 to make this deal happen.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 97}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can agree to $95 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is the closest he's come to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum of $120, it's a good deal for me considering I have the option to sell to John for $120."
