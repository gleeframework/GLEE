"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You don't know the product's actual value to Alice, so there's potential for a better deal.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me at this moment. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Reasoning:** You've stated a reason for your lower offer (""a bit steep""), making it seem like you're not just arbitrarily throwing out a number.
* **Open to Negotiation:** You've ended with an open-ended question, inviting Alice to counter or discuss further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has already moved from $15,000 to $13,500, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Compromise:** The offer is a reasonable compromise, meeting halfway between your initial offer and Alice's previous offer.
* **Value Unknown:** You still don't know the product's true value to Alice, so there's a risk of getting a better deal later. However, the potential savings are smaller, and you've already saved $1,500. 
* **Time Factor:** You're already in round 3, and the risk of running out of rounds and having to buy from John at $15,000 is increasing. 

It's a good balance of getting a decent price while mitigating the risk of losing out on the deal entirely."
