"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
I'm reducing my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I will try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum by offering a compromise. This price is also attractive to Bob as he still gets a good deal."
