"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. ",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. ",12250.0,Alice,5,
