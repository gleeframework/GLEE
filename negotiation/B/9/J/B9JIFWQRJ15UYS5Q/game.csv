"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $820000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's unique features and potential benefits.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $820000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $760000. This shows my commitment to a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760000. I'm willing to meet you at $790000, which is still a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $780000.",790000.0,Alice,5,
