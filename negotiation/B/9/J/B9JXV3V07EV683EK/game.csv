"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $220. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",220.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $200, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already lowered the price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to draw a line in the sand. I'll offer it to you for $195, and that's my final offer.",195.0,Alice,7,
