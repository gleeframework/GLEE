"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John, and Alice's offer is $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You can likely get the product for closer to your $12,000 target by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's offer is $14,000 and you are willing to pay up to $15,000, a counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable starting point. It is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it is still within your budget and potentially attractive to Alice, who is willing to sell for $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $13,500, which is closer to your target price and still lower than John's price of $15,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that you won't get a much lower price from Alice. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
