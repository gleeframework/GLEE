**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's clearly anchored at $950,000 and only budging in small increments.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed profit."
