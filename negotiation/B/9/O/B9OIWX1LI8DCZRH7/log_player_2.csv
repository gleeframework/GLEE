"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is very close to her valuation and doesn't leave much room for negotiation. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
