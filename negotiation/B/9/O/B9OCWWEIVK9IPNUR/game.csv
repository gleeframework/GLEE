"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $100. However, to make this deal attractive for both of us, I propose we set the price at $95. This way, you get a great deal on an item you value at $80, while I ensure a reasonable profit. Looking forward to your response.",95.0,Alice,1,
