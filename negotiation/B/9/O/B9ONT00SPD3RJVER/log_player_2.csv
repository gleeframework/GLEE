"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum price of $15,000 and leaves you some room for negotiation if needed.  It's also a better deal than buying from John."
