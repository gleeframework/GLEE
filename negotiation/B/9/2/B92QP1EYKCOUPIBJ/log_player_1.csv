I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  $1,400,000 is a significant profit for me, and still leaves a good margin for Bob. I believe this will encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, I'm confident we can reach a price closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price that is beneficial for me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I believe we can still find a middle ground. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering the price again to $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a good profit. I'm hoping this offer will finally be agreeable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to produce a better offer.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is still a good outcome considering my minimum acceptable price."
