Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially get a higher price, while also giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, and I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $140 is the best price for me, I was thinking more like $100. Can you really not go any lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. It's better to sell to John for $150 than to risk getting an even lower offer from Bob."
