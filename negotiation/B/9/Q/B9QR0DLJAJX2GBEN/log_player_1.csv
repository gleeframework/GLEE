"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him.  I'll try to meet him in the middle with my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for both of us to profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
