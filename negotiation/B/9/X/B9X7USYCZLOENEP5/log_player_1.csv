Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Knowing Bob's value is lower than yours and John's, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at high demand (""interest I've already received"") to justify the price and potentially make Bob act quickly. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price or move on to John."
