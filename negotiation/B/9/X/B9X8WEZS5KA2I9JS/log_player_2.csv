Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still quite a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,225,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You're getting the product for $75,000 less than your maximum budget and Alice is unlikely to go much lower.
* **Time:** You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and further haggling might not yield much more benefit.
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, leaving you to buy from John at your maximum budget anyway."
