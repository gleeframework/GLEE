"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $1,125,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still quite a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,225,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
