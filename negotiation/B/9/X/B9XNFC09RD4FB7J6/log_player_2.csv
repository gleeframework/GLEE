"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $9,000, which is higher than her value of $8,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us, giving me a good price and you still making a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $8,750 is closer to your desired price point of $8,500. 
* You are still saving $1,250 compared to buying from John. 
* Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there is a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you ending up with no deal.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the safer option to secure the product and save money."
