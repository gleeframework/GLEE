"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us, giving me a good price and you still making a profit. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,750. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
