{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $10,000 (selling to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you want to aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, leaving him with a perceived good deal while still securing a significant profit for yourself.

**The Offer:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you rather than miss out. You secure a $4,000 profit, which is a good outcome compared to selling to John."
