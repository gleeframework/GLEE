"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1100000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value for the product, and I'm willing to accept it if you're willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
