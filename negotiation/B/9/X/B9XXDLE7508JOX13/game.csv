"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $110 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $107.50. Let's find a compromise.",107.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $109.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us, and it gives us both a little room for compromise. Let's make a deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
