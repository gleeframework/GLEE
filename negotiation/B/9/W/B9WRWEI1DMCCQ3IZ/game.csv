"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me right now. Considering its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response and your understanding of the product's inherent value.  While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a higher investment. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This price acknowledges your interest while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
