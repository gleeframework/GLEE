"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $108 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
