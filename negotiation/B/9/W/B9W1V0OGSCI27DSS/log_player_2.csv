"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's always beneficial to see if you can get a better deal.  Since you have 10 rounds, rejecting the first offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. A million dollars is a significant reduction from her initial offer, and it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This will give me an idea of her flexibility and hopefully lead to a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above my desired price range.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price closer to my desired value before resorting to buying from John.  I have 7 rounds left, and I'm confident I can still secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm still aiming for a price that is significantly lower than her last offer. This approach aims for a gradual compromise and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is a good price considering my initial goal was to stay under $1,500,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, it's risky to keep going.  There's a chance she could become less flexible, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer guarantees I get the product at a good price, and I still have 5 rounds left if I need to negotiate other terms later."
