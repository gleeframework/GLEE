Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me, and it's within a range that might work for both of us.
