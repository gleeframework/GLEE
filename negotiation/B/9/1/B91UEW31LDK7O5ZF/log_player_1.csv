Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $975,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects a price that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $950,000 is still a bit high. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This represents a solid compromise and allows for a successful transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While holding out for a higher price is tempting, Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to my price point. Accepting his offer of $925,000 is a significant profit, and continuing to push risks losing the deal entirely."
