Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $150.  I have John as a backup buyer if this negotiation falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than Bob's offer, but I'm also trying to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, $150 is my minimum, and I'm confident I can find another buyer.  I'm going to sell to John."
