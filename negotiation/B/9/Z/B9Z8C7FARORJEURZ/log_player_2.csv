"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than his maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his target. It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially reach an agreement closer to $1,200,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to move slightly from my previous offer. Let's settle at $1,250,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my part and is as low as I'm prepared to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still $50,000 more than what he could get from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation, as John is offering a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
