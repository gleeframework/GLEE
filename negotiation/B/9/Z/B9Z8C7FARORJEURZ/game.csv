"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, considering its value to me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to move slightly from my previous offer. Let's settle at $1,250,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my part and is as low as I'm prepared to go.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
