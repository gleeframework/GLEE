"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and lets me gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to frame the high price as justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message expresses openness to finding a mutually agreeable price, signaling I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy helps me gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the possibility of a highly profitable deal on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  To start, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product, which is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better deal.  I know I have a backup offer from John, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet. There's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This reflects the true value and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial drop from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000, signaling flexibility. However, it keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's inherent value to justify the still-high price.
* **Forward Momentum:**  The language emphasizes moving the negotiation forward, encouraging Bob to engage constructively. 

I'm aiming to create a sense of progress while holding firm on a price that remains beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to settle for $1,150,000 yet. I still have room to negotiate and I'm aiming to get closer to $1,300,000. It's a risk, but I believe there's still potential for a more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the significant value you're getting while still being fair to me."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:** I'm stating a firm price this round, aiming to signal this is my target zone. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm explicitly using the phrase ""middle ground"" to encourage a sense of compromise and fairness.
* **Balanced Justification:** The message acknowledges the value proposition for Bob while emphasizing the need for a price that works for both of us.

I'm aiming to strike a balance between standing firm on a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and equals what John is offering. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting this offer guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids the potential of losing both buyers."
