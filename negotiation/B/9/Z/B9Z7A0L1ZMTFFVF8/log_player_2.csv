Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the significant value you're getting while still being fair to me.

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still higher than my maximum. I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get her closer to my target.  I still have some room to negotiate and I don't want to pay more than I have to."
