"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  To start, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
