Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers incredible value, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the ""incredible value"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** While the price is high, it leaves a tiny bit of room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
