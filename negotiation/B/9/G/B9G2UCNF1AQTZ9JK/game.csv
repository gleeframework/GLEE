"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  It's a significant value for a product that can really boost your operations.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000 for the product?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value the product brings.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for my current budget.  Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
