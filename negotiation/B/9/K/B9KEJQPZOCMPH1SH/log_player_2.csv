"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,100,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  This option is only desirable if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant discount:**  Offering $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's $1,100,000, showing your commitment to negotiating.
* **Leave room for compromise:** This counteroffer still gives Alice a profit margin above her $800,000 valuation. 
* **Gauge Alice's reaction:**  This first counteroffer will give you an idea of Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects it outright, you'll know you need to be more aggressive in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to your target, $1,050,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You have more negotiation power:**  You've successfully pushed Alice down from her initial price. Continuing to negotiate could potentially yield an even better price.
* **John is still a fallback:**  Remember, you can always purchase from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice.  

**Next Steps:**

You should make another counteroffer to Alice in the next round. You can try a price slightly lower than $1,050,000 to test if Alice is willing to move further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This price is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's most recent offer. 
* **Showing willingness to meet halfway:** It demonstrates your commitment to finding a solution while still leaving room for Alice to make a small concession.
* **Assessing Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will tell you if Alice is willing to budge a bit more. If she rejects it again, you'll need to adjust your strategy in the following rounds."
