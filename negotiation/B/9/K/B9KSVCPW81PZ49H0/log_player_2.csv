Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While I understand your desire for a lower price, $1,175,000 is still below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $1,187,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,193,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,193,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,193,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than this. Accepting at $1,193,750 secures a significant saving compared to John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
