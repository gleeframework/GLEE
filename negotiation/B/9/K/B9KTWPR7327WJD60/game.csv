"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $7,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value while working for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is the last price I can offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
