"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $137.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",137.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $137.50 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and I take it for $133.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",133.75,Bob,4,
