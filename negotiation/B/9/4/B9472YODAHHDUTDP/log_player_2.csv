"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting Alice's initial offer and trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $11,500 is still slightly above Bob's ideal value of $10,000, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob has already made a counteroffer and been rejected.  Continuing to push for a lower price risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Alternative:**  While John's offer is still available, it's $4,000 higher than Alice's current offer, making Alice's offer the best option.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer represents a good compromise that saves Bob money while securing the desired product."
