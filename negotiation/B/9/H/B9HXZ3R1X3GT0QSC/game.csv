"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your minimum is $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant returns. How about we meet halfway at $2,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,850,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for us both. How about we settle on $1,925,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your investment.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,925,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for $1,875,000 as a final price. It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
