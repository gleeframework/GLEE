"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $875,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about $800,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",800000.0,Bob,4,
