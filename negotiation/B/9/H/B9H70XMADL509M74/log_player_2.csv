"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000. There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is aiming to get a price closer to his ideal value of $12,000.  A $1,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point.
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm. It acknowledges Alice's offer while stating Bob's counterproposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. While I believe the product is worth more than that, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice's offer of $13,750 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a $1,750 gap. This leaves room for more negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If Bob rejects the offer, he might get a better price, but he also risks Alice becoming less flexible in the future. However, the potential savings outweigh the risk at this point.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** Rejecting the offer signals that Bob is determined to get a better deal, and it keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,750 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob is offering a smaller reduction this time ($250) to show he's serious about reaching an agreement. This also leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving too much away.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting.
* **Closing Intent:**  The message clearly indicates Bob's willingness to finalize the deal at this price."
