Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However, I'm not aiming for a wildly unrealistic price as I'm also aware of John's offer of $8,000, which serves as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more than $8,000, Bob's counteroffer is already my minimum price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
