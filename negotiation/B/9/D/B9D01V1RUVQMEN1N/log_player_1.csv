Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $120 is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting me closer to my desired price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A lower starting price might leave me with less room to bargain if Bob counters.
* **Attractive to Bob:** $120 is still a good value for Bob since the product is worth $150 to him. 
* **Avoiding immediate John sale:** $120 is significantly higher than John's offer, so I'm not rushing to sell to him immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for profit:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's not the best deal possible.
* **Negotiation power:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm willing to walk away, giving me leverage in the next round.
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired range ($120), potentially leading to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $110 shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  Framing it as ""splitting the difference"" makes the offer seem reasonable and fair to Bob. 
* **Avoiding John:**  $110 is still significantly better than selling to John, so I'm still prioritizing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? That's the lowest I can go, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $105 is just $5 below my initial offer of $110, which is a small enough difference to accept.
* **Good profit:**  $105 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring I'm making a profit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject his offer, he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80.  
* **Bob's willingness to compromise:** His comment about liking the product suggests he's still interested in the deal.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good deal, making a decent profit while avoiding the risk of getting a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
