"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in exploring this further. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1400000.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise: $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit higher than my target price.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This feels like a fair price that's within both of our budgets.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1300000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession: $1320000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
