"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully curated and I know it will serve you well. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a significant discount considering its true value.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent offer, you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price."
