"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly above my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true worth of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $1,150,000. This is a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
