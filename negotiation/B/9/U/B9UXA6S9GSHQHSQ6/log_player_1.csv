"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn closer to my desired price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm offering $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay. This should give Bob a strong incentive to accept, as it's much closer to his valuation than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his own valuation, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to try to get a better price, as we still have more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering $1,300,000 as a compromise.  It's a significant step down from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's latest offer.  This might make him more likely to accept, while still getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  While there's a chance we could reach a deal, it's also likely that he'll continue to offer prices below what I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
