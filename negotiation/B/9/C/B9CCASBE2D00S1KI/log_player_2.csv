# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $11,500 for the product. This offer takes into account the significant worth of the product to you and aims to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you, or if you have any questions or concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you can save $500 by going with John's offer. Since your maximum budget is $12,000 and John will sell it to you at that price, it makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer."
