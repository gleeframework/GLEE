"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find the best possible price. While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this reflects its worth while still offering you a good deal.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price range.  
* **Further negotiation is possible:** There's still a gap between Bob's desired price and Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially close that gap."
