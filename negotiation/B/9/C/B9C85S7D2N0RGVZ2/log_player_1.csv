Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a $10,000 limit. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to him for $10,000, I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Would you be open to reconsidering?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer, I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000, which aligns more closely with my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his $10,000 price, which is below my minimum. It's clear we are not going to reach an agreement. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, I will choose to sell the product to him to maximize my profits."
