"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a $10,000 limit. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Would you be open to reconsidering?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer, I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000, which aligns more closely with my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,4,
