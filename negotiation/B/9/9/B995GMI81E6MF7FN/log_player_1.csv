Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John ($80), so you're not desperate to accept any offer below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
