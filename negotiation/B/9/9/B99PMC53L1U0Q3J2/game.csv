"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. To be completely transparent, my absolute floor for this product is $1,050,000. I'm making a significant concession at this price because I believe in its potential for you. I'm hopeful we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
