"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1100000 is still too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate that.  But $1075000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $1125000?  That's a fair compromise that recognizes your value and my need to get a reasonable return on this investment.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
