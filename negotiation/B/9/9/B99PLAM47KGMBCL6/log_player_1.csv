Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.

Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. It's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, and I have several rounds left to negotiate.  It's a risk to accept this, as we are nearing the halfway point and I'm still above my minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate that.  But $1,075,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  That's a fair compromise that recognizes your value and my need to get a reasonable return on this investment.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the halfway point, and while $1,090,000 is tempting, I'm confident that we can close the deal at a higher price. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. We've come a long way in the negotiations, and it's important not to settle for anything less than what I believe is fair."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 2 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult. Bob is not willing to move much further, and I am concerned that if I reject his offer, he may walk away entirely.  I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round, and it's better to secure a sale at this price than risk ending up with nothing."
