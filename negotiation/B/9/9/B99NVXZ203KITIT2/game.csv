"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to sell to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10500, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
