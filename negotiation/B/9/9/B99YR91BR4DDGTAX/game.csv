"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to find an agreement.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,250,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
