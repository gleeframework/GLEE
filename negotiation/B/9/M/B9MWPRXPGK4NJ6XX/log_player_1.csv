This offer is strategically placed. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets the tone that you're willing to compromise, while still aiming for a profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
