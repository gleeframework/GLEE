Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You are better off continuing to negotiate or buying from John for a fixed price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget. You've already tried negotiating with Alice, and she's clearly not willing to go lower than $1,250,000.  It's best to cut your losses and buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
