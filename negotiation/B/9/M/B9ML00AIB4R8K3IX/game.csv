"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
