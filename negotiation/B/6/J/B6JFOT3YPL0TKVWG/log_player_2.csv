"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, I can attempt to get the price even lower. I have the safety net of John's offer if negotiations fail, so there's little risk in pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This allows for a good profit margin for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also acknowledging your desire to pay less. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her original offer but still within my budget and gives me a substantial saving compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance I won't be able to get a lower price, so accepting her offer is the best choice at this point."
