"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price range.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
