"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $7200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",7200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $6800? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it. Can you see your way to meeting me at this price?",6800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $7000.

I hope you can see the value in this offer and consider it a fair compromise.",7000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6800 and $7000. Would you be willing to consider $6900? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really want to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me at this price?",6900.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a significant concession to get to $7000. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $7100. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can see the value in this offer.",7100.0,Alice,7,
