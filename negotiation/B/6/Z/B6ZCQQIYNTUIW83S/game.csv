,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $105.  How about $110? That's a significant discount from my original price, and still leaves some room for us both to be happy.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $105 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $105 just isn't feasible for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a good compromise.  Let's try to make this work.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. How about $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,6,
