"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm willing to let it go for less than my minimum value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns closely with my valuation and budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This still leaves a reasonable profit margin for me, and is closer to your desired price. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I am still unable to meet at $11,000 due to my financial constraints. I propose we settle at $10,000 for the product. This aligns closely with my budget and would allow us to reach an agreement. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,4,
