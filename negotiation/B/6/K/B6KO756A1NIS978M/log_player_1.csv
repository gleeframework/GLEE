"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($100), hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also framing it as a good deal to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to pay up to $95 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value ($100). I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm coming down to $105, which is still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $100 for your product. I hope this meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum value, and it's a good outcome considering he started at $95.  I'm willing to accept and close the deal."
