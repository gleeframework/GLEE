(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you want to pay, but you're getting closer to a deal. You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice is showing flexibility. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating for a price closer to your target. You can make a slightly higher counteroffer, but you should also be prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice continues to be inflexible."

{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's position. It's also still under your maximum budget, leaving some room for further negotiation. At this point, you're gauging Alice's willingness to meet you halfway. If she rejects this offer, you might be better off purchasing from John to avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price, and you've already made multiple counteroffers. This suggests that she may be unwilling to negotiate further. It's now approaching your maximum budget, and you're risking getting stuck in a stalemate.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at a price within your budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
