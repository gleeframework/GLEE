# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows for some profit for you as well. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
