"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the $9,000 range. Would you be willing to consider $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $9,800? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",9800.0,Alice,5,
