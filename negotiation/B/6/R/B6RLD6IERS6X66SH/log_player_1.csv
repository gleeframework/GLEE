"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum and even his own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we possibly settle around $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below what John is offering.  I'm going to hold firm for now.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe $16,000 is a fair price that reflects that. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product offers value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough decision. Bob has now met his own valuation of the product, but it's still less than what John is offering. I'm concerned that if I push further, I might lose Bob completely. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher.  Selling to John guarantees me the price I need and avoids the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with nothing."
