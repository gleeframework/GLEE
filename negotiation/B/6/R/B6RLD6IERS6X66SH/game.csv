"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we possibly settle around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe $16,000 is a fair price that reflects that. What are your thoughts?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this product offers value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
