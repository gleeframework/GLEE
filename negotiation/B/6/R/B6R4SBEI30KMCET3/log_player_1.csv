Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and based on its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I should aim for a higher price with Bob. 
* **Strategic Overpricing:**  Starting with an offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, attempting to justify the higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob might reject the initial offer, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $300,000."
