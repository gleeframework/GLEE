{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, acknowledging the value of the product to me, but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price than John's offer.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? I appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I am willing to potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $15,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $16,500? This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $15500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $15,500 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer.  This is a good deal, especially considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's offer of $12,000.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent price and close the deal."
