"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500. Would you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9250.0,Alice,5,
