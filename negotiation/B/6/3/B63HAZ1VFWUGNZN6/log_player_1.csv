{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  There's a chance I could get a higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away is too high, especially since John is also an option.  $13,300 is a good compromise."
