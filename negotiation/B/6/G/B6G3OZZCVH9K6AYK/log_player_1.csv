"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.

This strategy aims for a quick sale at a high price, but we're prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  We always have the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me though. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still significantly lower than both our initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate and are willing to wait a bit longer to secure a better deal.  We are confident we can bridge the gap through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its value."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and are willing to move from our initial price.
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** The drop of $150,000 is substantial enough to show flexibility but still keeps us well above Bob's offer and closer to our target price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 

We are pushing for a strong price while remaining open to negotiation.  Bob's willingness to engage in counteroffers suggests he's motivated to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me. How about $1,000,000?  That's a strong offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now within an acceptable range. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This offer is $200,000 above our minimum sale price to John, representing a healthy profit margin.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, demonstrating his strong interest in the product. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations for a potentially smaller gain might not be worth the additional time and effort.  

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and settling for $800,000 from John is not worth it at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures a substantial profit and a successful negotiation."
