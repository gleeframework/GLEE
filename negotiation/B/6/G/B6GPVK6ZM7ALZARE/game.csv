"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is higher than my current budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This reflects my understanding of the market value and is the highest I can go at this time.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your highest offer at this time. However, I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable going that high.  I'm willing to offer $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $950000 is a bit below the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support, which will add significant value to the product. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
