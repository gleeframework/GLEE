Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $85 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him for $85, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can secure at least $90, which is still better than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $90.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've received your latest offer of $90. While I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, I still feel that $85 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's clearly not willing to budge much, I'm not giving up on getting closer to my target price of $90. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $88.  This is a great price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 88}
