"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested and how high his budget might be.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and also lower than my guaranteed minimum value from John. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll counteroffer with a higher price to try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum value from John.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, even though it's closer to my minimum value from John. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not willing to accept a price below $1,000,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still holding firm above my minimum value from John.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while also demonstrating my determination to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer, and I'm risking losing the sale to John. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum value without any further risk."
