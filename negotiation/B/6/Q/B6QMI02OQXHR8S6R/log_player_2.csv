"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept the initial offer or buy from John immediately.  We have 10 rounds to negotiate, and Alice's opening offer is our maximum budget. We need to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($1,500,000) allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. It's a bold move, but it establishes a clear expectation that we're seeking a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to our desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. We're not in a rush, and we can try to secure a better deal with more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're increasing our counteroffer from the previous round, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate. The price is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it demonstrates our willingness to compromise. We want to test if Alice will accept a price closer to our initial counteroffer."
