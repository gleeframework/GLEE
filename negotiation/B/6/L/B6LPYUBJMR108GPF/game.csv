"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already stretched my budget to try to reach an agreement, but I think I've gone as far as I can. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $980000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",980000.0,Bob,6,
