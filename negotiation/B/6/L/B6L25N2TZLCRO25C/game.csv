"Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations.  My initial offer is $1150000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair starting point considering its true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure $1150000 is the right price. Considering my maximum budget and the potential for negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price point. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a significant concession on my end. This price ensures a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to maximize the value of your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
