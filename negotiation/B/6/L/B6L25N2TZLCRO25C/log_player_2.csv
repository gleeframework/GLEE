"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations.  My initial offer is $1150000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair starting point considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure $1,150,000 is the right price. Considering my maximum budget and the potential for negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price point. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a significant concession on my end. This price ensures a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to maximize the value of your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a better price than what John is offering.  While there's always a possibility of getting a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer and Bob having to settle for John's higher price is too high. Accepting this offer secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
