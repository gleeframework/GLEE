Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (John's offer) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down while still staying above our minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the price more palatable.

**Why not ask for more?**

While we could start higher, it risks alienating Bob. A price too close to $1,200,000 might make him walk away immediately, sending us to John (our guaranteed backup)."
