"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a bit high. How about we settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,125.  That way we both get a good deal and can move on. What do you say?",12125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right about finding a middle ground. How about we agree on $11,950 and call it a deal?",11950.0,Bob,6,
