Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000 before listing it publicly. This is a great opportunity to get ahead."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We start by aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than your minimum ($15,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **First Offer Advantage:**  Presenting a strong initial offer can often lead to a quicker sale and potentially discourage negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""before listing it publicly"" implies scarcity and encourages Bob to act fast.

**Why not higher?**
Pushing for a price too close to $15,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. 

**Why not lower?**
While a lower price guarantees a sale, it leaves potential profit on the table. You always have John as a backup who values the product at your minimum."
