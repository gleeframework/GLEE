Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and leaves room for counteroffers.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still sell at my minimum.
* **Potential for Compromise:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so a price between $8,000 and $10,000 could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, but I really like the product and think it's worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $1,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation might take time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, accepting Bob's offer is still a good deal and ensures a quick sale."
