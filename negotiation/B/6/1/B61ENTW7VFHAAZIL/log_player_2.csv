"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly beneficial for your business. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay the full asking price. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* Alice is offering the product at the exact price you are willing to pay. 
* There is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as you can buy the same product from John for the same price.
* Since you want to save as much money as possible, the best option is to buy the product from John."
