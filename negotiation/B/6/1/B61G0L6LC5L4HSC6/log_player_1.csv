"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong opening offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We don't want to start too low and undervalue the product, but we also want to give Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, ensuring we don't have to settle for less than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than our opening, but still above our minimum. This suggests he's willing to negotiate further, and we can likely reach a price higher than $1,200,000. 
* **Backup Buyer:** We still have John as a secure alternative, allowing us to confidently counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. The value this product offers is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This seems like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've come down by $100,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit. 
* **Justification:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We've used three rounds, and while we have time, moving towards a close is generally beneficial in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's counteroffer movement is getting smaller ($50,000 this time). This might indicate he's nearing his maximum, and we have room to push back.
* **Above Minimum:** We're still comfortably above our guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Strategic Delay:**  Rejecting gives us time to assess Bob's next move and potentially make him believe the product is more valuable than he initially perceived."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. However, this product's unique value justifies a higher price point. Let's settle this at $1,250,000 and close the deal."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at a price point closer to our previous offer, signaling we're serious about the product's value.
* **Compromise Incentive:** Offering a $10,000 decrease might be enough to entice Bob while still remaining profitable for us.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By framing this as a final offer (""let's settle this...""), we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Absolute Maximum"":** Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to go higher.  By stating this is his final offer, he's trying to force our hand.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could negotiate further, the potential gains are shrinking, and we risk pushing Bob away entirely. 
* **Still a Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit above our guaranteed sale price with John. 

It's better to secure a strong deal now rather than risk losing the sale by being overly aggressive."
