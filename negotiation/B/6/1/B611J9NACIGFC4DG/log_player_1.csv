"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not overly concerned about risking a deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's first offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly higher than my minimum. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not ready to accept it.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a slightly higher counteroffer.  If not, I'll be willing to accept John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $8,500. This is a significant concession, but still $500 above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and recognizes that I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  Since we're nearing the end of the negotiations, I'm going to take John's offer and sell the product to him for $8,000. This ensures I get at least my minimum price and don't risk ending up with a deal that is less than what I'm comfortable with."
