Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which still leaves you with a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.
