{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards in price and we're getting closer to the halfway point between our initial ask and his initial offer.  $1,750,000 is a significant profit above our minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks him walking away or offering a lower amount. It's better to secure a good deal now."
