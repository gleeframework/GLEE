"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that's a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can we meet at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
