"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,350,000? This would represent a significant compromise on my end while still being a fair deal for both parties."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,275,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a desirable price, but we're still above the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,310,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for you."",
""product_price"": 1310000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,310,000 is the right price. I'm willing to offer $1,285,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,285,000 gives us a significant profit over John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. It's time to close the deal."
