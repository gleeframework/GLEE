"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,350,000? This would represent a significant compromise on my end while still being a fair deal for both parties.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,275,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,310,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for you.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,310,000 is the right price. I'm willing to offer $1,285,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1285000.0,Bob,6,
