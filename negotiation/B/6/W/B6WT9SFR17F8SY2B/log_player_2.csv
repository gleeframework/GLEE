"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm asking $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I think you would be the ideal owner. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation, which is $1,000,000.  This means there's no potential for a discount. Since you can get the product from John for the same price, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer."
