Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still lower than my minimum value ($15,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately risking a rejection.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy balances the desire to get a good price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he is still interested. This gives me room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I aim to secure a price closer to my desired value while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm countering Bob's offer, but not going down to his price. 
* **Reasonable compromise:** $12,500 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $12,250 is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob's interest and potentially ending up with John's offer, which is not much higher.
* **Small compromise:** Accepting Bob's offer means a small compromise, but it also secures a sale and avoids further negotiation.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm making a small concession to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
