Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't come close to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to go higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum. I believe this counteroffer is fair and gives Bob an incentive to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
