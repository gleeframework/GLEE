"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $105? I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings, and it's still a good compromise for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
