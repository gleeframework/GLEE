{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price, but I'm running out of time, and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum.  I'd rather take the guaranteed money than risk getting stuck in a negotiation loop and potentially ending up with less."
