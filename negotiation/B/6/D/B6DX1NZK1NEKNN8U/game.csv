"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above what you value it at. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to compromise too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, considering its worth to you is $8,000 and my original price was $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
