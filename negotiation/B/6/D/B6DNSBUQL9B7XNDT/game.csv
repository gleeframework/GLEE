"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  My initial price is $900,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let's discuss.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can increase my offer to $700,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, while staying within reasonable limits.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 simply isn't enough to justify selling. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a significant concession. This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we are making progress, but $750,000 is still below the value I need to consider. Let's try $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. It's a win-win for both of us, allowing you to acquire this valuable asset at a competitive price while ensuring I get the value I need.",800000.0,Alice,7,
