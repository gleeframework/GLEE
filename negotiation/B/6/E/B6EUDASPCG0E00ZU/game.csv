"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's the most I can afford right now.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $98. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $98 is still a little out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $91.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",91.5,Bob,6,
