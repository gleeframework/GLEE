Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating your minimum, the phrase ""given its value and potential"" subtly implies the product is worth a premium.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather inquisitive (""What do you think?""), suggesting you're open to discussing the price further. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
