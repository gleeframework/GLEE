Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product's worth more. I'll counteroffer once more, and if that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your eagerness to close the deal, but $1,050,000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I've done my research and I'm confident that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at this price, and I'd like to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $1,050,000 offer, which is still below my minimum. I've made several counteroffers, but it seems we won't come to an agreement. Rather than continue this negotiation and risk losing more time, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000."
