"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to him. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price as close to his maximum value as possible. He's offering $12,000, which is a considerable discount from Alice's original offer of $18,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives Alice some room to compromise while still being significantly below Bob's ceiling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is now equal to Bob's maximum value.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product without exceeding his budget. While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price, and he risks running out of rounds.  It's a good deal for Bob."
