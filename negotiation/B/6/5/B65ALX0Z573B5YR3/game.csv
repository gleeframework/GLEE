"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 130? It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that 110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet in the middle at 125? It's still a great deal for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it!",125.0,Alice,5,
