Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message might encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can lower the price slightly in future counteroffers.
* **Knowing my alternative:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $15,000, so I won't go below that price."
