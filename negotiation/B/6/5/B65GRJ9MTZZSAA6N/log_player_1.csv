I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for my minimum price of $10,000.  If he rejects, I'll move to John, as that's the guaranteed sale."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to $10,000.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9800.  This is still a good profit for me and hopefully close enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm going to sell to John. It's guaranteed money and gets me my desired price."
