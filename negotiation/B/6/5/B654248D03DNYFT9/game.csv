"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
