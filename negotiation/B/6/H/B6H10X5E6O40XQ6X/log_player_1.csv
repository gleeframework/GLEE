Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's enticing but still profitable.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net.  
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice aims for a win-win scenario:

* **If Bob accepts:** Alice makes a $1,500 profit (better than selling to John).
* **If Bob rejects:** Alice sells to John for her guaranteed $12,000."
