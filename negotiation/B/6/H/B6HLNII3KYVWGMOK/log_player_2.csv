"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $11,500 is a better price than the $12,000 Alice offered previously and is getting closer to Bob's ideal price. While it's still above the $10,500 counteroffer, it's a reasonable compromise.  There's a chance Bob could get a lower price if he rejects the offer and counteroffers again, but it's also a risk.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids the potential for Alice to reject his counteroffer, leaving him with no option but to buy from John at a higher price."
