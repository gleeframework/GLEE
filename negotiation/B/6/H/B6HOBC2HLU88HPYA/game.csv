"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,150,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,250,000. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
