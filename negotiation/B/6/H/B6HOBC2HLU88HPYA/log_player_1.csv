"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I also want to test Bob's true commitment to the purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,150,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,250,000. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
