Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for profit above your minimum price ($80).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $100 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a fallback buyer (John) at $80, ensuring you won't be left with a loss if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
