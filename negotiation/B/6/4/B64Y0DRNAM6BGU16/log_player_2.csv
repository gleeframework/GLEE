{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I am aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* Offering $700,000 is a considerable discount, leaving room for negotiation.
* This price is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, making it a reasonable starting point."

* It is also within my budget.
* Accepting the offer ensures I get the product without further negotiation."
