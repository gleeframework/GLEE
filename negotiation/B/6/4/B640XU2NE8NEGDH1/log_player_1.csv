Bob is not showing a willingness to move significantly towards a price point that reflects the value of the product.  While going back and forth might bring his offer up slightly, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is already offering. Cutting my losses and taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the best move at this point."
