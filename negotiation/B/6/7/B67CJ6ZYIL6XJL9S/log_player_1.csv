Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still higher than Bob's initial offer. I hope this will incentivize Bob to accept, as it's closer to his perceived value and still provides me with a reasonable profit."

Bob is stuck at $12,500 and I'm not willing to go that low.  I've already rejected his offer once, and I'm not confident he'll budge further. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
