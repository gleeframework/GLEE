"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you ($10,000). You can get the product for less by rejecting Alice's offer and buying it from John."
