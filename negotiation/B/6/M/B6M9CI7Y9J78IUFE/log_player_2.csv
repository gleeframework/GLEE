"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for her to make a profit.  Let's see if she'll accept!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still better off trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can still get the product for less than $95.  Let's see if you can get her to go a little lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, but it still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. You're showing that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with her at this point. You'll save more money by buying the product from John."
