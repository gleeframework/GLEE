"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of immense value to your business. I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **It's a better deal than John's:**  You can save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 

While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer guarantees you the product at a price that's better than your other option."
