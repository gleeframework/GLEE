# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for my product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice you're willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price lower than her offer.  It's a strategic move to try and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm thinking of $1350000. This is my best and final offer on this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there.  $1,325,000 is the highest I can go at this point.  If you're serious about making a deal, let's close it here."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a subtle increase from your previous offer, showing Alice you are willing to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price. It's close to her offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal, but still keeps some room for bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1325000 and my previous offer of $1350000, so I'm thinking of $1337500. This is my last offer before I start to get concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, and we're approaching the final rounds of negotiation.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price, which is within your budget and significantly less than what John is offering.  There's a good chance you could push for a lower price in the next round, but the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings. It's time to close the deal."
