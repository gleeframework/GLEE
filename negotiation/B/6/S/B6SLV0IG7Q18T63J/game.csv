"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. I'm willing to offer $1200000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for my product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a good deal.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm thinking of $1350000. This is my best and final offer on this round.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there.  $1325000 is the highest I can go at this point.  If you're serious about making a deal, let's close it here.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1325000 and my previous offer of $1350000, so I'm thinking of $1337500. This is my last offer before I start to get concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement.",1337500.0,Alice,7,
