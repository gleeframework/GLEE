Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $1,250,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for a couple of rounds of counteroffers before reaching the point where it's more beneficial to sell to John.
* **The ""Great Deal"" Angle:**  Positioning the offer as a ""great deal"" adds a bit of pressure on Bob to accept and avoid missing out. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The actual best strategy will depend on how Bob reacts and how much you want to risk going through multiple counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Counteroffer:** I can likely negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest price. However,  by rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially secure a better price with Bob without the risk of losing the sale completely.

**Next Step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""fair deal"" and ""make this work"" encourages a positive outcome. 

**Important Note:**  This counteroffer still allows for another round of negotiations if necessary, while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
