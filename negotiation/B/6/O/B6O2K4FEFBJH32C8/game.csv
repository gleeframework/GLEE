"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $18,000 is closer, my budget really tops out at $14,000. Would that work for you?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a really nice product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,6,
