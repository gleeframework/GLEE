Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $80 is actually below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need at least $130 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Alice is very unlikely to go down to $80. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for your maximum budget."
