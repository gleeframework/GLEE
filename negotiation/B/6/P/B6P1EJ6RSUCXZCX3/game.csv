"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $950,000 undervalues it considerably.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,025,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,4,
