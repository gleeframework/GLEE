Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

While Bob is willing to meet halfway, that halfway point is our absolute minimum price.  There's no room for negotiation upwards from here, and it's unlikely Bob will suddenly offer more. We can secure our minimum acceptable price with John."
