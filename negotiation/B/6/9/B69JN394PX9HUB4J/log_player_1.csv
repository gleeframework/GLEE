{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer:**  I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, which is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I aim to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and potentially reach a compromise. 
* **Plan B:** I have a backup option with John, ensuring I'm not pressured into accepting a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point and my value for the product. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I believe I can still secure a higher price through further negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's high enough to make Bob reconsider but still allows room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm keeping John's offer as a backup in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget considerations, I am able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value for the product.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm committed to maximizing my profit. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make one more counteroffer and potentially bridge the gap.
* **John's offer:** I'm still hesitant to accept Bob's offer, knowing I can secure a much higher price from John. However, I'm willing to take one more negotiation round with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and drop the price to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to meet me halfway on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer by $25,000, showing I'm willing to compromise but still maintaining a respectable price point. This is a final attempt to secure a deal with Bob without settling for an offer significantly below my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise, expressing confidence in a mutually beneficial agreement, and implying this is my final offer.
* **Negotiation strategy:** This counteroffer is a calculated risk. If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll move on to John for a much higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in making this deal happen. I am willing to consider your latest offer of $1,075,000. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable given the value of the product to me. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** While Bob is willing to come up slightly, his offer of $1,060,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value for the product.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I've made several concessions and reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me a much higher profit, making it the most sensible choice at this stage. 

I'm willing to end the negotiation with Bob and secure a much better deal with John."
