"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",10800.0,Alice,5,
