"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is higher than both your maximum price and her value for the product. There's significant room for negotiation.  It's best to counter-offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $70."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Anchors low:**  It starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Stays within reason:** While low, it's not offensively low, given Alice's product valuation.
* **Expresses interest:** The message conveys that you are serious about purchasing, but need a better price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can do better than $70, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $95 is still closer to your maximum budget than your desired price. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and encourages her to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. How about we settle on $80?  That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** This offer matches Alice's known value for the product. While it's unlikely she'll accept a price with zero profit, it puts the offer on the table and might encourage her to accept a slightly higher number.
* **Displays Willingness to Compromise:**  You've increased your offer from $70, signaling you are willing to meet in the middle. 
* **Simple and Direct:** The language is clear and avoids unnecessary complexity."
