{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum price ($80).
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with $100 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you make a good profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John ($80), so you're not desperate to accept any price from Bob.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
