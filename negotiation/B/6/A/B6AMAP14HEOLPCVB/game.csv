"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to your business. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm confident it could be even more valuable for the right buyer.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.  This is a substantial price, but I believe it reflects the true potential of the product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
