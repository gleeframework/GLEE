"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what the product is worth.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a fair deal, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,100,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,250,000.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000, and you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  You're better off taking the guaranteed savings."
