"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what the product is worth.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair deal, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,100,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,250,000.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
