Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is significantly below what I consider the true value of this asset.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000. This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects the value you've shown in the opportunity.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.
