Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I've researched its worth and I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000 to someone like you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll benefit from."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You have valuable information: Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives you significant leverage.
* **Aiming High, But Reasonable:** Starting with an offer of $12,000 aims high but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlighting Value to Bob:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob specifically, making it more appealing.
* **Safety Net of John:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
