"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is less than what John is offering, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He's aiming for a price closer to $850,000, so rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a good middle ground and shows I'm serious about making a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about making this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $887,500. This is a very fair price considering both our perspectives. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $887,500 is within Bob's budget. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might not budge or even increase her price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob and avoids the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price."
