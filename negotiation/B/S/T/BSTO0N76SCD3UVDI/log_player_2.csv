"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $150. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than what I'm willing to pay and even exceeds John's backup offer.  I need to negotiate a much lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $150 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your position.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $110?

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
