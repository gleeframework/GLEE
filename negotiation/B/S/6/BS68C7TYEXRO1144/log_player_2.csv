"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950,000. This is a significant discount considering the value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you as well, so I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to make a good profit. What do you say?

Alice has come down to John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John since the price is the same.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at your target price."
