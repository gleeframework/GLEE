Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950,000. This is a significant discount considering the value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $700,000, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you as well, so I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $750,000?  It seems like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I think I can still get a higher price from Bob with a little more negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to make a good profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
