"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with an ambitious offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" we provide a reason for the high price without revealing our own bottom line. 
* **Positive Tone:**  We maintain a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage engagement and create a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price. However, it's still early in the negotiation.  We'll reject his offer to signal that we value the product higher and try to nudge him closer to a more favorable price. We have enough rounds remaining to justify continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $800,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We signal a willingness to negotiate by making a significant price reduction ($50,000). 
* **Justification:** We avoid justifying the new price with specific reasons, keeping the focus on finding a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes that our offer is a compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe that the product's value aligns more closely with my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant profit above our minimum of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a willingness to meet us closer to our price point.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or Bob potentially lowering his offer."
