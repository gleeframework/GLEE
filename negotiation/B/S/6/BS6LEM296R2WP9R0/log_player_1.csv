{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This price allows for potential negotiation, as Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value.
* **Protecting my Minimum:** This price is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, ensuring a profit if Bob accepts.
* **Option to Sell to John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's potential for Bob to increase his offer in the next round, especially since he's already shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.
* **Option to Sell to John:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $975,000.  This still represents a great deal for you and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, ensuring I still profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  Highlighting that the deal still represents a ""great deal"" for Bob might encourage him to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By making a counteroffer, I retain control and prevent Bob from setting the final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and respect the value of the product to you. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to offer $960,000 for the product. This still saves you some money while allowing me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's still potential for Bob to increase his offer in the next round, especially since he's shown a willingness to negotiate.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. Your offer is getting closer. However, I'm still committed to getting at least $970,000.  This is a very fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only increasing my counteroffer by a small amount ($10,000) to show flexibility but still maintain my position.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I emphasize that this price is fair to both parties, playing on Bob's desire to reach a compromise.
* **Urgency and Closing:**  I add a sense of urgency (""Let's make this deal happen"") to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Minimizing Risk:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value, but closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Short:**  Bob's offer of $965,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Potential:**  It seems unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer further.
* **Guarantee Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and avoids further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort without any assurance of a better outcome."
