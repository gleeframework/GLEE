"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Alice.  $115 is too close to my maximum, and I'm hoping to get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get the product for less than $110. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $109. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still like to save a few more dollars, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to close the deal with Alice at $109 than to risk losing out and having to pay $120 to John."
