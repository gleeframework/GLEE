Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for anything less than what the product is worth to me."
