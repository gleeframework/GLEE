{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing John is our backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate and potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000 (his perceived value) but still below our guaranteed $1,200,000. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights ""unique features"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify a price above Bob's perceived value. This framing aims to make the offer more appealing.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a single-round negotiation. We don't know if Bob has other options, so pushing too close to $1,200,000 might make him walk away.
* We need to balance confidence in our product's value with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
