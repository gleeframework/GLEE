"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $900000 is a reasonable price, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $950000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I hope you'll consider this a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made two concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer, and that's $1050000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
