"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.
