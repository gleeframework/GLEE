Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant benefit to you considering your own valuation."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have crucial information that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us significant leverage in negotiations.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without being unreasonable and risking a rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While our initial offer is strong, a slightly lower price might be accepted if Bob tries to negotiate.  The $1,100,000 price point leaves us some buffer while still aiming for a very profitable outcome.
* **Backup Option:** It's important to remember we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This ensures we won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob."
