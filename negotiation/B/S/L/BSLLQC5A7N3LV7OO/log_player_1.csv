Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm thinking $115 would be fair, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum value of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $115 is lower than Bob's value of $120, so he has room to negotiate if he wants to.

This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $105? It's still a good price for you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $102.50 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $102.50 is only slightly below your minimum of $100.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk is that you'll lose Bob and have to settle for the $100 price with John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a slightly higher profit."
