"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Since I'm aiming to save as much as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows me to potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $950,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my ideal price, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives me another chance to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me and its value to you. I'm confident that this price will be acceptable to both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my ideal price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John at a significantly higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price within my budget."
