Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer for Bob, considering the information:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be worth far more than the asking price in the long run.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your decision, as I do have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  Offering the product at $1,200,000 aims to secure a significant profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's ""unique value proposition"" rather than just its features.  This subtly suggests that the price is justified by the value Bob will receive.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another interested party (""John"") creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it doesn't mean it's non-negotiable.  This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob could reject a high offer outright. However, with a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you're not at risk of losing the base value."
