Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant discount and I'm confident it's a fair price."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really not comfortable going above $13,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

**Reasoning:**  Bob is firmly rooted at $13,000 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired minimum ($15,000), it's time to cut your losses with Bob and move on to the sure thing."
