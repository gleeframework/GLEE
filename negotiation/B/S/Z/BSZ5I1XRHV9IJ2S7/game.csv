"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline at $1,350,000. I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this might open up further discussion.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
