Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm not willing to accept a price that low, especially since I know it's worth much more to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

While $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500. This feels like a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}

I've had enough of these back-and-forth negotiations with Bob. He's not willing to meet me closer to my price point, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,012,500. It's time to take the sure deal with John for $1,200,000."
