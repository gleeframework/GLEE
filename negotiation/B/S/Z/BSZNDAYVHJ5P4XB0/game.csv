"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not quite there on the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",795000.0,Alice,5,
