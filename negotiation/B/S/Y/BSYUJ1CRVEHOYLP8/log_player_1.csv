"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $1,300,000, still well above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully pushes the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, bringing me closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This is a final attempt to secure a deal with Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm still hoping for a better price, I'm running out of rounds. To avoid potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is my guaranteed minimum."
