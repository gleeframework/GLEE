**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $95 in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is only slightly higher than Alice's current offer.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her not going low enough, forcing you to buy from John at $100 anyway."
