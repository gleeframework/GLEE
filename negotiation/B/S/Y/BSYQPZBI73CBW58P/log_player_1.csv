This offer starts at a price above Bob's perceived value but is still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I don't give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to reach a final agreement.

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a price closer to $9,000."

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions.  At this point, it's more profitable to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Even though I'm losing a potential $1000 with Bob, it's still better than accepting his offer and selling below my minimum."
