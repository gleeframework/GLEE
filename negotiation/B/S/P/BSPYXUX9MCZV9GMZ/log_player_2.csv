"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for a potential lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price, and a $2,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant step in that direction.  This counteroffer is still above Alice's minimum of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product while still saving a substantial amount of money."
