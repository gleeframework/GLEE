"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price to maximize potential profit. This sets the bar and allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the product's unique nature to suggest its potential value to Bob.

**Strategy:**

*  This first offer is a test. I want to see how Bob reacts. 
*  If he's interested but counters, I'll have room to negotiate downwards.
*  If he rejects outright, I'll consider the John option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counter-offer in the next round. I'll aim for a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his initial price. 
* **Guage Interest:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I gain more information about his true interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Keeping Options Open:** While I could accept and get my minimum price, it's worth seeing if I can get more. The John option is still there as a backup if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still trying to secure a higher price. The $900,000 counteroffer represents a compromise, showing flexibility.
* **Highlight Value:** I re-emphasize the value proposition, reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Open-ended Question:** I use an open-ended question to encourage further conversation and gauge Bob's response.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** I'm gauging Bob's maximum price point. If he accepts, it's a win. 
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:** By rejecting his first offer and counter-offering, I'm showing I'm not desperate and have options. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900000 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking to get the best possible deal.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850000?  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I still have room to push for a higher value.  

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Momentum:** While I'm tempted to take the $850,000, rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation moving in my favor.  
* **Show Confidence:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of my product and not desperate to sell.
* **Counter-offer:**  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer but higher than Bob's, aiming for a final deal that's closer to my initial goal."

```
