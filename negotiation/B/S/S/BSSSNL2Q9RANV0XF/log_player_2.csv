"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds immense value and is tailored to meet your specific needs, just like it has for countless others. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it is worth $15,000. I kindly invite you to consider this offer and seize the chance to own something truly remarkable. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for her own value of $15,000. This leaves no room for Bob to save any money. Since John is guaranteed to sell the product for $15,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John. This avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice where Bob might accidentally accept a price higher than $15,000."
