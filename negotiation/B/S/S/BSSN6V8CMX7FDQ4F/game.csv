"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $85.  How about we split the difference?  $92.50 would be a fair compromise, and still a good deal for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not ready to go down to $85, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about $90? It's a fair compromise, and still leaves you with a profit. Let's make this deal happen!",90.0,Bob,4,
