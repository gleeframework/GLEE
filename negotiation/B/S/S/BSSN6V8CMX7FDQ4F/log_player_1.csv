Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob space to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is a decent offer, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a higher price,  and see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $85.  How about we split the difference?  $92.50 would be a fair compromise, and still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not ready to go down to $85, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about $90? It's a fair compromise, and still leaves you with a profit. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is a decent compromise and a good profit considering my minimum is $80. It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might get frustrated and walk away."
