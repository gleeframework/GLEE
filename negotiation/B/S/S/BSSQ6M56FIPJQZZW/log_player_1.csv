Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $125 is more than your $100 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $125 is less than the $150 Bob values the product at, giving him an incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price slightly in future rounds.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is still a good profit, you can likely do better.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you open the door for further negotiation and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $121? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $121
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've reached a price very close to your initial offer, and you're only $1.50 away from your goal. It's unlikely Bob will offer you more, so accepting his offer is the best choice to maximize your profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential loss of sale to John."
