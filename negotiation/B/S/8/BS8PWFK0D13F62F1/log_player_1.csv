{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum value ($15,000) but leaving room for negotiation.  This price is also within Bob's perceived value ($12,000), making it potentially attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that is closer to my minimum value.  There's still potential for a deal with Bob, and I don't want to prematurely sell to John if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer while still remaining above my minimum.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my flexibility while still securing a decent profit."
