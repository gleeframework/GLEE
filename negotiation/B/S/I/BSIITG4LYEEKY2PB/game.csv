"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $1,500,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This reflects the significant value it offers and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial deal.",1850000.0,Alice,3,,
