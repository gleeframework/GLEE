"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better. The product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a good deal and is starting with a counteroffer that is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This gives Alice some incentive to consider the offer, but it also shows Bob is serious about getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to push the price back up, but Bob is still determined to get a better deal.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still aiming for a price below Alice's minimum, but this shows that he is taking her counteroffer into consideration.  By keeping the offer within a reasonable range, he increases the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer. He is showing a willingness to compromise, but still trying to get a better deal.  This offer is still below Alice's current offer, but is within a reasonable range, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is pushing the price up again.  At this point, Bob has only two rounds left to get a deal.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and failing to reach an agreement is too high.  By buying from John, Bob ensures he gets the product at a price that is within his budget, although it's not the best deal."
