"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget, Bob, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's the highest I can go. I really think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
