Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours. By starting high, you can see how interested he truly is and if he's willing to negotiate seriously. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum of $12,000. There's room to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a higher price. You'll need to counter with a price that's closer to your minimum while still encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you have a budget, Bob, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By coming down from $15,000 to $13,500, you're showing a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his price range.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's value reminds Bob of its benefits and justifies the higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $13,500 is still above your minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary while aiming for a price point more favorable to you than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's the highest I can go. I really think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob's latest offer of $11,000 is still below your absolute minimum of $12,000.  
* **Unlikely to Budge:**  Bob has explicitly stated that $11,000 is his highest offer.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $12,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when you have a sure sale that meets your minimum price. 

It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
