Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. This allows both of us to benefit significantly. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That seems fair to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product.  While his offer is getting closer to our minimum, we have room to negotiate further and aim for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to find a deal that works for both of us.  However,  $975,000 is still less than I'm willing to accept.  I can go as low as $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we are getting closer. How about $1,012,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer in Round 6 is getting very close to our minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer ensures we make a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal by pushing Bob too far."
