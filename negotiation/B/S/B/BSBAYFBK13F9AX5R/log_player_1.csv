{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's value of $8,000, giving him incentive to negotiate, but it's also below my minimum value of $10,000, allowing for some wiggle room.
* **A friendly message:** I want to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation, so I express that I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not going too low with my initial offer, I allow for a back-and-forth exchange that could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, this is just a starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the information I have about his willingness to negotiate.  I'm also keeping John's offer of $10,000 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is still above Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum desired price of $10,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing money.  

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal is to maximize profit:** I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a fallback option with John. 
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Counteroffers are expected:** It's normal for buyers and sellers to make counteroffers. By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise. $9,000 is the midpoint between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him at this price.
* **Maintaining my ground:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to continue negotiating if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm also ready to accept it if it's a deal that both of us are comfortable with. I'll be watching for any signs that Bob is close to his limit, and I'll be ready to switch to my backup option if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal is to maximize profit:** I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a fallback option with John. 
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to stand my ground.
* **Counteroffers are expected:**  I expect Bob to make a counteroffer again. This gives me a chance to assess his willingness to go higher. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target of $10,000, but also acknowledging the fact that his budget might be a constraint. I will aim for a price that is attractive to both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's split the difference again. Would you be willing to consider $8,875?  It's a small increase from your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8875} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This strategy shows I'm committed to reaching an agreement.  $8,875 is the midpoint between my last offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $8,750.
* **Acknowledging budget constraints:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns to avoid pushing him away.
* **Maintaining a reasonable price:**  While lower than my ideal, this price is still within a reasonable range for me, given that John is offering $10,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that Bob might be reaching his limit.  If he rejects this offer, I might have to consider selling to John or making a final, low counteroffer."
