"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1250000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
