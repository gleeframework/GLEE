"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $110 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to start with a significant counteroffer. $90 is still above your ideal price of $80, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price of $80. There are still rounds remaining, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting closer to a deal.  Alice has moved down from $110 to $105.  By offering $95, we're showing that we're serious about getting a good price, but also that we're willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to your goal of $80, it's still worth pushing for a lower price.  You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice is clearly willing to come down in price.  With a few rounds left, it's worth trying to squeeze out an extra few dollars in savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

**Explanation:**

We're in the final stretch of the negotiation, and Alice has come down to $100.  Offering $98 is a small but significant step closer to our target price of $80.  It shows that we're committed to getting a fair deal, while also leaving some room for Alice to counter if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $102 is closer to your ideal price, but with only three rounds left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation. The odds of reaching your goal of $80 in the remaining rounds are slim.  Since John is offering the product for $80, it's more beneficial to buy it from him now and secure the best possible price."
