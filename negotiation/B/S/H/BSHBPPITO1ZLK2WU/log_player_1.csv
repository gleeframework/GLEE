{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potential for a deal that benefits both of us.  I'm also leaving the door open for a counteroffer, while simultaneously reminding Bob of the value he'd be getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a significant price difference, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I need to try and negotiate a better price, even if it means a few more rounds.  Selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, but I'm hoping to secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This would still be a great price for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to squeeze a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with ensuring a deal gets done.  $825,000 is a good compromise that guarantees a sale and still brings in a significant profit."
