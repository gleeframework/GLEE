"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000.  You can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
