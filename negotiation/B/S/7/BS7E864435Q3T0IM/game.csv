"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
