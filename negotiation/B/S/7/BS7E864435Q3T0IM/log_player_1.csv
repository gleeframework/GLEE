{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly above your minimum:**  You're already securing a profit of $400,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob likely sees value in the product above your offer price. This gives him a reason to counter.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A price closer to $1,500,000 might make Bob feel pressured to accept immediately, while this price encourages a negotiation that could ultimately benefit both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a good amount, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. While I would prefer more, it's only a small margin away from my initial offer and the risk of him further lowering his offer or me having to sell to John for $1,000,000 is too high.  It's time to secure the deal."
