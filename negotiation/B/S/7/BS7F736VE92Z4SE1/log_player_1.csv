Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly higher price allows for negotiation room. It also tests Bob's interest level and potential budget. Even if he rejects this initial offer, it gives me a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own stated value. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm looking for a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could come down to $100.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between my initial offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($60). It signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significantly below value,"" I subtly remind Bob that I'm aware the product is worth more to him, encouraging him to meet me closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Can you meet me at $70? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is slowly moving towards my desired price point, but $70 is still below my minimum of $80. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap.  Selling to John is always an option, but I might be able to get a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's make this happen - how about $85? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  This counteroffer meets Bob in the middle ground between his last offer ($70) and my previous offer ($100), while still exceeding my minimum price. 
* **Finality:**  By stating ""my final offer,"" I signal that I'm serious and unlikely to go lower. This could prompt Bob to accept if he truly values the product.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects this, I can always sell to John for $80 and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about $75? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. He hasn't significantly budged from his $70-$75 range. It's now more profitable to take the guaranteed $80 from John than to continue haggling with Bob, risking a lower final price or prolonged negotiation."
