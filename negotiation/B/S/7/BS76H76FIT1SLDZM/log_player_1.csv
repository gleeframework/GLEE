"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $900,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a price he's likely to consider since the product is worth that much to him. I'm aiming for a good deal but also leaving space for potential concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher amount. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering $875,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal,  $860,000 is a good price, and I'm worried that continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's important to balance the potential for a better price with the risk of getting nothing."
