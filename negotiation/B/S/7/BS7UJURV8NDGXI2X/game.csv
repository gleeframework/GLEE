"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the best price I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,100,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already discounted the price significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
