"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price that's still lower than the value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging a deal. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for the price, suggesting it's a fair deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profits, but I'm also aware that if the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $800,000. This gives me a safety net.
* I'll be flexible in subsequent rounds, but I won't give away too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my target. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 or higher, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Avoiding the Floor:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is a safety net, but I don't want to settle for the minimum unless absolutely necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still allows me to make a good profit and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price, but I'm not giving in entirely.
* **Justification:** I'm again providing a reason for the price, focusing on fairness and profit.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. 
* **Building Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving and get closer to a deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm confident that I can push for a slightly higher price, especially considering that Bob has shown continued interest. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** I'm not ready to accept $850,000 yet. I believe there's still room for a counteroffer to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell at a price that's significantly below my target, especially with only a few rounds left."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to make a final compromise by dropping my price to $890,000. This is a significant concession but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price.
