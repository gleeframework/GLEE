"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I can't go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price, considering the value and quality of the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.  What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
