"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering our previous discussions.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000 for the product, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
