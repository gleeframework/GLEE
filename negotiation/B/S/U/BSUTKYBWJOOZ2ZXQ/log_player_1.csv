Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'll offer it to Bob for $90. This is a good starting point, as it's close to the true value of the product to Bob, but still gives me a decent profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for $80, as it's worth more to me. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $85. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's still lower than my original offer, but higher than Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","As previously mentioned, I'll offer the product to Bob for $85.
