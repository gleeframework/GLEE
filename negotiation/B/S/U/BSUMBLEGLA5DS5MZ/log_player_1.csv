Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I know you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might pay slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a deal for Bob while still potentially earning you a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, highlighting a ""special price"" to entice Bob. 
 
**Outcome Possibilities:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $19 profit, which is better than selling to John.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for $120, achieving your minimum acceptable profit."
