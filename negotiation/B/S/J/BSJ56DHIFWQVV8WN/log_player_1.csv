{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still leaves you with a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still keeping Bob interested.  The offer is high enough to be attractive to Bob, but it also leaves me room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while keeping within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for the product.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $875,000.  This price still leaves you with a substantial profit and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is closer to my desired price point, I still feel that we can reach an even more equitable solution. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a price of $860,000. This offer still provides a good profit margin for you and keeps within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $860,000 is still below my minimum value, it's getting close.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially needing to sell to John at a lower price.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale now."
