"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still leaves you with a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while keeping within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for the product.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $875,000.  This price still leaves you with a substantial profit and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is closer to my desired price point, I still feel that we can reach an even more equitable solution. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a price of $860,000. This offer still provides a good profit margin for you and keeps within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable.",860000.0,Bob,4,
