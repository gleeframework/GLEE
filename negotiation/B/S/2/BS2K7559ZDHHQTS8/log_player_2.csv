"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you're still $25,000 above your target of $700,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $712,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $720,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $720,000 is very close to your target of $700,000. You could continue to negotiate, but at this point, it's likely that further haggling won't get you a significantly better price.  Accepting the offer saves you $80,000 compared to buying from John."
