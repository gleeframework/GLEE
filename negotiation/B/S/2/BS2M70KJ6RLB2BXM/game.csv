"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm looking for a price around $22,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $12,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still losing a lot of value at $12,000.  Perhaps we can settle on $16,000. This offer reflects the fairness I aim for in my deals.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  How about we try $13,500?  I feel this is a strong offer that brings us closer to a deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I want to close this deal.  $13,500 is a bit too low for me, how about we split the difference and call it a deal at $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up a bit to $13,800. Let's make this happen.",13800.0,Bob,8,
