Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving me room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John, it makes sense to accept his offer and close the deal."
