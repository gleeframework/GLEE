It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. Each round brings us closer to John's offer, making the potential gain smaller and smaller.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means having the $1,050,000 sooner. This money can be reinvested or utilized for other opportunities, making it potentially more valuable than waiting for a slightly higher amount later.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, which can be beneficial for future business interactions. 

While the ideal scenario was to get closer to $1,100,000, securing $50,000 over John's offer is a significant win."
