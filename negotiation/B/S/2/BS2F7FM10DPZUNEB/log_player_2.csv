"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There is room for negotiation, and I should aim to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to offer you $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also giving you a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my initial investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer a slightly lower price, it's still well within my budget and gives me a decent savings compared to buying from John.  It's also closer to the product's worth to Alice, which suggests she is getting a reasonable deal as well.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better price, and risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer is a good balance of saving money and securing the product."
