"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to offer you $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also giving you a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my initial investment.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
