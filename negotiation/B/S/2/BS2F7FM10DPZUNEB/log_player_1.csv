Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to offer you $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also giving you a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
