"I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",100.0,Bob,4,
