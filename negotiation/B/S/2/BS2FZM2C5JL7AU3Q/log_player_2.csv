"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell you this exceptional product at a special price of $10,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than John's price of $12,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $8,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob might be able to get Alice to lower the price further, allowing him to save more money."
