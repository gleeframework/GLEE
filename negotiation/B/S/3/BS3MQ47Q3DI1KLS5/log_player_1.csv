Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $105?  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob's offer of $97.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk going lower, especially with John ready to buy at my minimum price. It's a safer bet to secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation."
