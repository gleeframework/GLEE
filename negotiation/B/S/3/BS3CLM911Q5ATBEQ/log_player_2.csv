"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth, and I believe you're the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly signalling this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming smaller and I risk her walking away. It's better to secure a good deal now at $11,250 than to potentially lose out and have to buy from John at $15,000."
