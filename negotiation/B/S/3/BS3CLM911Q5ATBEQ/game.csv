"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth, and I believe you're the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget. How about $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
