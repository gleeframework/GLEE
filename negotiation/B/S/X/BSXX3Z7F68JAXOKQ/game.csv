"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm looking to make a profit.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. Given the value to me, I'm offering $8,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what I need to make, while still being a good deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you, while also acknowledging the value it holds for me.",12500.0,Alice,5,
