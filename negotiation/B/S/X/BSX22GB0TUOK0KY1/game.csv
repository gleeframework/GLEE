"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's features and potential.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the product's value justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential while still being a good deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. Would you consider $825,000? I believe this is a reasonable price for a product with such value.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to meet you halfway, but I need to be firm on this. I can't accept less than $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",825000.0,Bob,6,
