"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its high value and quality, we're confident it could be worth $150 to you. However, we're willing to make it more accessible by suggesting a price that reflects our commitment to fair trade and understanding of your budget. We kindly propose a price of $120 for this exceptional product. This offer is exclusive to you and comes with a special warranty for an additional month. We hope you find this proposal appealing and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. While you could try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice would agree, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy it for $120."
