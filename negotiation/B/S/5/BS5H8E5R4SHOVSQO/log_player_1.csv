Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer again, so how about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob is consistently moving in smaller increments. Accepting at $925,000 locks in a significant profit, and the risk of him walking away now might not be worth the potential upside of a few more rounds."
