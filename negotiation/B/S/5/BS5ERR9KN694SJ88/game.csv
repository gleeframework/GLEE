"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can do better. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $110 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $107 for the product.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $107 is still not quite enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $109. It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
