{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $65 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
