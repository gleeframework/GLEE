"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm starting the negotiations at $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to settle closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $12,000 initially, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher value. This can influence Bob's perception of what's reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  Even though you have a firm minimum price, starting high allows you to make concessions throughout the rounds, which can encourage Bob to engage more readily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would you consider $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's willing to move from his initial valuation.  We have room to push for a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can come down a bit, but $10,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're showing flexibility by moving down from our initial offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing $11,000 positions the offer as a compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Value:** We're still significantly above our minimum price and Bob's initial offer, signaling that we believe in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $10,500 is a solid profit above our minimum of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest in purchasing the product.
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's also the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiations dragging on.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
