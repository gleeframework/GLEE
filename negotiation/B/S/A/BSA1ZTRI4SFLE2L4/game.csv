"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would be a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to find a middle ground.  This offer still provides you with a significant value while giving me a fair return.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $975,000 as a compromise. This offer is very close to your last offer and provides me with a more reasonable return. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
