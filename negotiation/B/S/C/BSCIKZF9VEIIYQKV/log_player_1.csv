"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170.  This is above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160. This is still above Bob's value, but it's a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about making a deal and encourages him to come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, I'm wary of risking John's offer. Accepting this deal ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
