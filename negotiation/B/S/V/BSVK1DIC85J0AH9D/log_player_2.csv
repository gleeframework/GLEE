"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's below your maximum price, but you can likely do better.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have a significant buffer between Alice's offer and your maximum price.
* **Exploring other options is valuable.** By rejecting the offer, you can see if you can get a lower price from Alice or if John might be willing to lower his price if you make him a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save as much as possible. However, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.**  The offer is only $50,000 above your counteroffer.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You're still below your maximum price of $1,200,000 and can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **It's not yet time to buy from John.**  You're close to a good price with Alice, and John's price is significantly higher."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm confident we can reach a deal at $825,000. Let's keep the momentum going."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save more, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $825,000, but I'll throw in a special bonus package worth $15,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has met your counteroffer.** This is a positive sign, showing she's motivated to close the deal.
* **The bonus package sweetens the deal.** Although the bonus is relatively small, it's an added value that makes this offer more appealing.
* **You're saving a significant amount.**  You're getting the product for $375,000 less than John's price. 
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the risk.**  While you could potentially try to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's no guarantee Alice will agree, and you risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure a good price than to push your luck."
