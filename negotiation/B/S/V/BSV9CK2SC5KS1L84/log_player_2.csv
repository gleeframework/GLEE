"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Unknown:** You don't know the value of the product to Alice. It's possible she's willing to sell for less.
* **Negotiation Potential:** $9,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that potential. 
* **Time to Gauge:**  You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the first offer won't hurt you significantly. It gives you time to see if Alice is genuinely interested in lowering the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about saving money. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a good way to see how flexible Alice is. If she rejects it, you'll have more information to work with in future rounds.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $8,000 is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Good Deal:** $8,500 is a good price, considering your initial goal was to stay under $10,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are not significant enough to risk losing the deal. 
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have 7 rounds left, and each round adds uncertainty. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget and saves time for potential future negotiations."
