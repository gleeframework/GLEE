"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget.  It makes more sense to reject and counteroffer, trying to get a better price.  Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should explore negotiating with Alice first to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for his maximum budget.  Offering $10,000 is a bold move, but it sets a strong baseline and leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's possible Alice might reject this offer, but it's worth trying to see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation, aiming to get the price down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product.  $12,000 is a compromise between his maximum budget and Alice's latest offer. This move could potentially lead to a faster agreement, especially if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has enough rounds left to potentially get an even better deal, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  It's a gamble, but potentially worth it to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise.  $13,000 is a fair middle ground, and it's possible that Alice might find this offer acceptable.  This approach could lead to a quick agreement, saving Bob valuable rounds and potentially allowing him to secure a better price than John's offer."
