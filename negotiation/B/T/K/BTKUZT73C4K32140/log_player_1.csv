Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to make at least $10,000, and $14,000 comfortably surpasses that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's some wiggle room for him to counter-offer and for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **It shows confidence:** By starting high, you demonstrate that you believe in the value of your product.

Remember, the key is to be flexible but also firm in your belief that the product is worth a significant amount. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  

You can counter with a price closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's.  This shows you're willing to negotiate but also value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? That's still a fair price for a product worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer offers a compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your initial offer. By highlighting the value to Bob and presenting it as a ""split the difference"" scenario, it can increase the likelihood of a deal."
