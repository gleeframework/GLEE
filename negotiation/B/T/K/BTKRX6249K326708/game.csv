"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget. While I'm open to negotiation, $1300000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, but that's my maximum. Can we meet in the middle at $1325000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1325000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1375000. Let's make this deal happen.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1375000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1362500, but that's my final offer. Can we make a deal at this price?",1362500.0,Bob,6,
