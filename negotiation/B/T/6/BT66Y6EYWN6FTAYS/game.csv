"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my company.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this point.  This product has exceptional potential, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product for your company.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1325000 isn't quite there yet. This product truly has the potential to be a game-changer for your company, and I'm confident that the value it will bring will exceed this price. Let's aim for a figure that reflects that potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1350000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
