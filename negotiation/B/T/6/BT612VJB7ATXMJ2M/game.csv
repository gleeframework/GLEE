"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for a product with such great potential.  I'm eager to close this deal and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $875000, but that's as low as I can go. This price still reflects the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
