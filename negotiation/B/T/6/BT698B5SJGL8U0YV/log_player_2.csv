# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $13000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and also lower than what you'd pay John. Accepting this offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
