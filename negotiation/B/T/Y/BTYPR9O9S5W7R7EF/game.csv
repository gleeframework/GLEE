"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be significantly lower. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While $800,000 is too low, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This takes into account the product's true worth and potential return on investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving down, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we have a significant gap to bridge. I'm willing to come down further, but $950,000 is simply too far from the product's value. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This is a considerable concession on my part, reflecting my desire to reach a deal with you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
