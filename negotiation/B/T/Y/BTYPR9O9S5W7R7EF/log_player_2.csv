"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be significantly lower. How about $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $800,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a strong initial position. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer allows space for Alice to counter and for a potential compromise to be reached. 
* **Pressure Point:** By starting low, Bob signals to Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if necessary.  This keeps John's offer as a viable alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While $800,000 is too low, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This takes into account the product's true worth and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer is a significant drop, but it's still well above Bob's maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to move down suggests she's open to further negotiation.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** Bob has a strong alternative in John's offer, which gives him leverage to push for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving down, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase, Firm Limit:** Bob's counteroffer makes a substantial jump from his previous offer, signaling serious interest while establishing a firm ceiling.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $950,000, Bob creates a challenging but potentially acceptable price point for Alice, given her $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Bob's message subtly reminds Alice of his alternative option with John, keeping the pressure on her to negotiate within his range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we have a significant gap to bridge. I'm willing to come down further, but $950,000 is simply too far from the product's value. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This is a considerable concession on my part, reflecting my desire to reach a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Reached:** Alice has presented this as her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Still Above Budget:** Even with her concession, the price remains significantly above Bob's $1,000,000 limit.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer guarantees Bob gets the product at his target price, maximizing his savings. 

**It's time for Bob to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John.**"
