Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will be enticed by the potential value of the product and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob a chance to get the product at a good price while still allowing me to profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're far apart in our valuations.  Rather than continue this potentially unproductive negotiation, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John."
