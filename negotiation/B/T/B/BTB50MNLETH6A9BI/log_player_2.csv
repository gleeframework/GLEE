"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a good deal for both of us, as you get a great product at a lower price than you would elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
