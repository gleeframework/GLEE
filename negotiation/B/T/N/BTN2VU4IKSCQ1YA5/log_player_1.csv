Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to counteroffer, potentially allowing us to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, increasing the likelihood of him accepting or at least engaging in further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $150.
* **Opportunity to improve:** I believe I can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage to hold out for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100).  
* **Showing flexibility:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob that this is still a fair price for both parties. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I still have John as a backup option, so I can afford to be somewhat firm in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I would like to stick to my original proposal of $100. This is the maximum I am willing to pay for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm:**  Bob has made it clear he's not willing to budge beyond $100.
* **My minimum is not met:**  His offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John offers a better deal:** John is willing to pay my minimum, and potentially more, for the product. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the best possible price by selling to John."
