"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Starting Point:**  Beginning with a significantly higher price than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value provides room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind, potentially justifying a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The phrasing ""starting price"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal my willingness to negotiate and invite Bob to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His reaction will reveal how strongly he values the product and his willingness to pay a premium.
2. **Establish a High Anchor:** The initial high price can influence his perception of a ""fair"" price during subsequent negotiations. 
3. **Maintain Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and potentially accept a lower price closer to his $1,000,000 valuation if needed, as I always have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a more agreeable price. How about offering the product for $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my target range. I started high to create negotiation space, and I'm willing to hold firm for a better price. I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to his valuation but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the inherent value in this product. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,650,000. This reflects the product's unique nature while finding a middle ground for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I lowered my price by $150,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, this concession is still within the realm of aiming for a significantly higher profit margin.
* **Justification and Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to keep Bob's perception of its worth high. This reinforces why my price, while negotiable, is justified.
* **""Middle Ground"" Emphasis:** By framing the new price as a compromise, I'm nudging Bob towards accepting a figure above his initial offer but still potentially below his maximum willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand the product's value, but I would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000. I hope this aligns better with our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a strong price, representing a significant profit over my minimum. While I could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk of alienating Bob and jeopardizing the deal. Accepting this offer secures a substantial return and avoids the potential for a stalemate or Bob walking away."
