Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its value to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, we want to get the maximum possible profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants a slightly better deal. It's unlikely he'll go as low as $1,000,000 if he truly values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions the product as high-value without being unreasonably high. The message emphasizes mutual benefit, making Bob more receptive. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, we can adjust our strategy accordingly."
