"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $850000. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much margin. I'll counter with $920000, which is a compromise between my original offer and your maximum willingness to pay. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $920000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with $900000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at $880000. I'm willing to go up to that price, so I'll make a final offer of $880000. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $880000. I'll make one more counteroffer, and that's $890000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",890000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement at $880000, and I'm even more disappointed that you're not willing to meet me there. I think we've reached an impasse, and I'm going to have to consider other options. I'll have to think about buying the product from John for $1200000.",880000.0,Bob,10,
