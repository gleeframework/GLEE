"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it clearly defines my limit and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring the product.  Since John is willing to sell for this price, it creates immediate pressure on Alice to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from $800,000 to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still emphasizes my price limit. This middle ground might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, her offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as a few more rounds might get us to a mutually agreeable price. It's better to push for a better deal than to settle for a price that is still uncomfortable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice that I am willing to negotiate and reach a middle ground.  The difference between her offer and mine is now only $100,000, which makes the deal more likely to be accepted. If she rejects this, I'm ready to purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $225,000 above my maximum budget.  It's clear that we are not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  At this point, it's more efficient to purchase the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
