"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($200) compared to your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as you might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, $200 is my bottom line. I'm willing to let it go for that price, but I can't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $200, which is still above your budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring you stay within your budget.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're comfortable with."
