# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe it would be highly beneficial to your operations. I'm asking for $1,100,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can secure the product for a much better price from John."
