"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $100?  I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market value."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much money as possible, so we begin with a significantly lower counteroffer ($100) than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Justified:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment. We provide a reason for the lower offer (""fair offer considering the current market value""), even if it's a general statement. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  We don't want to lowball too drastically and risk offending Alice. This counteroffer signals that we're serious about buying but expect a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved her price down, which is good, but $175 is still significantly more than John's offer of $150. We need to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm glad we're getting closer. To be honest, my budget for this item is closer to $120. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We don't want to jump straight to $150 (John's price), so we're incrementally increasing our offer to signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Introducing a ""Budget"":** By mentioning our budget, we're subtly setting a limit and suggesting that this is our maximum price (even if it's not entirely true). 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  We're continuing to use appreciative language (""thanks for being flexible,"" ""glad we're getting closer"") to encourage a cooperative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $145? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down significantly in price, and $145 is only $5 more than John's offer.
* **""Final Offer"":** Alice stating this is her final offer adds weight to the negotiation. It's unlikely she'll move much further.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate risks missing out on a reasonable price. Accepting now secures the item and avoids potentially losing the deal."
