Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd be thrilled with the benefits it provides. I'm asking for $2,000,000. Given its potential, I'm certain this is a wise investment. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product and the offer can make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
