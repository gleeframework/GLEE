"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product name] at a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to obtain a valuable asset at a competitive rate. While I'm confident in its value, I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for potential negotiation with Alice or can proceed to buy from John at a lower price."
