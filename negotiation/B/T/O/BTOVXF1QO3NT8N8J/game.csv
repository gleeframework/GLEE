"Thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $9000 would be a fair price for me. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a bit more than I offered before. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's still a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further. I'm sticking to my initial proposal of $9000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the product's features.,9000.0,Bob,6,
