"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start by making a significant counteroffer.  $950,000 is a big jump down from Alice's offer and sets the stage for negotiation. It's likely Alice won't accept this immediately, but it's a good starting point to show Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He has the option of buying from John for a lower price, so there's no urgency to accept Alice's offer yet. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but he wants to avoid the risk of losing a deal by being too aggressive. $1,000,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, and this offer directly aligns with John's price. This puts the pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to rush into this deal.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price or force Alice to accept Bob's last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's previous offer of $1,000,000 was rejected, but Alice is now closer to that price.  He's unlikely to get a better price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, he needs to be firm. This offer forces Alice to choose: accept and close the deal, or risk losing it entirely to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, and with only 3 rounds left, the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing.  While $1,015,000 is a little higher than what Bob was hoping for, it's a good compromise, especially with the time pressure.  Accepting this offer secures the product without risking a last-minute negotiation breakdown."
