Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm being friendly and engaging with Bob to create a positive atmosphere.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, signaling that I'm open to adjusting the price if necessary. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still being open to a fair negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I want to try to get closer to my desired price. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal to Bob, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my rationale for the counteroffer, emphasizing the ""fairness"" aspect. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise that benefits both parties while keeping my earnings above my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $108 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's also close to my previous counteroffer of $110. While I would ideally like to get closer to $110, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even no sale at all.  It's a good compromise that keeps my earnings above my minimum target."
