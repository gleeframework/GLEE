Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're running out of rounds:**  We're at round 7, leaving little room to negotiate further.
* **Diminishing returns:** Alice is unlikely to drop significantly from her $11,250 offer. We've been splitting the difference and her concessions are getting smaller. 
* **Good deal:** $11,250 is a solid price, well below John's $15,000 offer and a decent savings from Alice's initial offer.

Waiting longer risks losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
