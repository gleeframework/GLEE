"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" providing a basis for the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I make it clear that I'm flexible and looking for a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A high starting point creates the possibility of landing a deal closer to my ideal price.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give me valuable insights into his negotiation style and how much he truly values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe I can get.  Here's why I'm choosing to reject and counter:

* **Information Gained:** Bob's offer (halfway between his perceived value and mine) suggests he's willing to negotiate. However, it also indicates he might be underestimating the product's true value to him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a substantial gap between his offer and both my asking price and my minimum. I have room to come down while still aiming for a much higher final price.
* **John as a Backup:** The safety net of John's offer allows me to take calculated risks in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will present a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but shows some movement towards Bob's price, aiming to keep him engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This reflects the unique benefits it offers while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer remains comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum, giving me room to negotiate further.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly reiterates the product's high value to justify the price while framing it as a ""fair deal"" for both parties.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility and how serious he is about purchasing the product. It sets the stage for a potentially fruitful back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Considering your initial offer was $2,300,000 and you've come down to $1,900,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or become less willing to negotiate. 

Here's why accepting is the best strategy at this point:

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,550,000 represents a solid profit above my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob has consistently aimed for the midpoint in negotiations. Accepting now capitalizes on his established pattern and avoids the risk of a lower counteroffer in the next round.
* **Time Value:**  Securing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and guarantees a favorable outcome rather than risking the uncertainty of future rounds. 

While selling to John would guarantee my minimum, accepting Bob's offer yields a higher profit, making it the most advantageous decision."
