Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** I've included a statement about the product's value to justify the high price, even though I haven't revealed the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives me leverage. I won't feel pressured to accept low offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, I started at $22,000 for a reason. There's potential for Bob to go higher, especially since he expressed a desire to find an agreement. I'll counter-offer to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $15,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18,500?"", ""product_price"": 18500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. By suggesting a price exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, I signal flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Maintaining a Strong Stance:** While I am coming down in price, I am not drastically reducing it. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without conceding too much too quickly. I am still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $15,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $15,000 twice, indicating he's firm on that price. It's unlikely he'll go higher. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further delay or risk of Bob changing his mind."
