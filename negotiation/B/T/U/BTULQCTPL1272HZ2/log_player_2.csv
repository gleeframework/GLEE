"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than what John offers, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($80). There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further in a subsequent offer."
