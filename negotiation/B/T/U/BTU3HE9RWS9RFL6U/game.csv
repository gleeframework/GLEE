"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
