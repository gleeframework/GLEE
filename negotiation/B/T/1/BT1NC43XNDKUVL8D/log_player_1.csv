"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```
At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for an uncertain outcome.
