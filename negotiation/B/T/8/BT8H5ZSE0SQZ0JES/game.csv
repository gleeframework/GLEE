"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $900,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair price for this valuable product.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned about your commitment to this deal.  $750,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'll come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a healthy profit margin.  If you're serious about buying this product, then let's make this happen.  I'm ready to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I am serious about this purchase.  However, I have a firm budget for this acquisition. I can offer $800,000.  This ensures I stay within my limits while still giving you a good price above your base.",800000.0,Bob,6,
