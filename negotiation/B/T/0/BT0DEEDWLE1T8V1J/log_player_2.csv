{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this point. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $12,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,000? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal now. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to keep it under $13,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer to what we can work with.  Let's try $14,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my budget. At $14,000, the deal is within my acceptable range. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's not worth risking further negotiation. If Alice rejects my next counteroffer, I might lose out on the deal, and I'm confident this price is a good value for the product."
