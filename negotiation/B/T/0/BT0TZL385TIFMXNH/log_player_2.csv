"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,500.** This is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John costs $12,000.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
