"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that I believe is fair and represents its value. I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and while I'm not willing to let it go for that price, I am open to a negotiation that benefits both of us. I'm confident we can find a price that's agreeable to both parties. Let's discuss a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
