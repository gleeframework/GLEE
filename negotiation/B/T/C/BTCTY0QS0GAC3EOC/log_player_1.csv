"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it! My initial price is $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can potentially get a better price than John's offer while still ensuring a profit.  I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I can only pay up to $85. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm not ready to sell for that low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm proposing a middle ground with $92.50. It's closer to my desired price point, and shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.  The message is friendly and keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget. Would $90 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my ideal price, it's still not as high as I'd like. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take a chance to see if we can get closer.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is closer but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about $91?  That's just a dollar more, and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

I'm proposing $91. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping that by being close to his offer, I can make it seem like a good compromise and get the deal done. I'm also stressing that it's only a dollar more, making it seem like a minor difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found out that the product can be bought elsewhere for $85. Considering this, could you please reconsider and offer a price closer to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is too low for me. He is clearly trying to take advantage of my situation by using the information about the product being available elsewhere. While I'm still open to negotiation, I'm not willing to lower the price significantly. I'm worried that if I continue the negotiation with Bob, we might not reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'll end up losing valuable time and energy.  Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit, and I'm going to take it to avoid further risks."
