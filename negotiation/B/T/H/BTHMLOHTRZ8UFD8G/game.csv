"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget.  How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still allows for a profitable investment for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  While $900,000 is still a bit steep, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $850,000. This price allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $750,000? This keeps us both reasonably close to our desired price points.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $750,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $800,000? It's a fair price, and it allows me to meet my minimum while still making this a worthwhile investment for you.  We're both close to a deal now, let's make this happen!",800000.0,Alice,7,
