"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this investment."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario and gives Bob an incentive to counter. I'm also setting the stage for a potential exit with John if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget.  How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, this is a huge gap.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my value while still acknowledging Bob's constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still allows for a profitable investment for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  While $900,000 is still a bit steep, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I need to keep pushing for a higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $850,000. This price allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $750,000? This keeps us both reasonably close to our desired price points. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $750,000 is still not enough. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. It's getting late in the game, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $750,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $800,000? It's a fair price, and it allows me to meet my minimum while still making this a worthwhile investment for you.  We're both close to a deal now, let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
