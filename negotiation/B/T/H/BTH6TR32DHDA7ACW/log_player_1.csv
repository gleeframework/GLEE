"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn a good profit, while also giving Bob some room to negotiate without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to its actual worth to me. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He clearly values the product highly, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500? This still gives you a good deal and is closer to my value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
