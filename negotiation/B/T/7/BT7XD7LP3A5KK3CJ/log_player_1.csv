Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to budge closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. At this point, the negotiation is taking too long, and I risk losing time and potentially a better deal with John.  I'm confident that John will be happy to buy the product at my desired price, so I'm going to sell to him."
