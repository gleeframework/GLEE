{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation by showing enthusiasm for the product and addressing Bob directly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you can try to get closer to your initial asking price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $135. This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and hopefully it's a price that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is interested in the product and willing to make a decision soon, his latest offer is below your minimum acceptable price. You can either risk continuing the negotiation and potentially lose more time or sell the product to John for a guaranteed $120, which is your minimum.  The time constraint and uncertainty of whether you can get a better offer from Bob make selling to John the most logical choice in this situation."
