"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his own valuation of the product. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. This gives Alice an incentive to consider the offer while allowing Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is significantly less than $15,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can secure a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still staying below Alice's offer of $10,500.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product while also keeping the price within his desired range."
