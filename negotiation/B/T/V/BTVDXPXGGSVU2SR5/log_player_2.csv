# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price today. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is over his budget, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no need to accept Alice's offer at this point."

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point, especially since he has a lower price option readily available."
