This offer starts with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than the product's worth to him, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to go below $90. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I am willing to work with you. However, $87 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway,  how about $89? That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 89} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $88? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $90.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's likely we'll go back and forth for a while longer.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so it's more efficient to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
