"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a solution that works for us both, $1,400,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
