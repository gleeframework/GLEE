"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can't afford your asking price.  I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can offer. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price or if you'd like to continue discussing.",1400000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price or if you'd like to continue discussing.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from your initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price or if you'd like to continue discussing.",1500000.0,Alice,5,,
