"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm offering $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. It's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
