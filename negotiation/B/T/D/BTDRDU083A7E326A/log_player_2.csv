"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for a price that is significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. While the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted price.  Consider it a win-win situation. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no need to spend the extra $300,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and maximize your savings."
