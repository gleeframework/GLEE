"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $10,000 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if Bob can get it lower.  There's no harm in rejecting and counter-offering, as Bob can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer!  I appreciate you're interested. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9250. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $9,250 is still above Bob's target of saving as much as possible.  There's still room to negotiate, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best course of action.  Bob can always buy from John if this negotiation falls apart."
