 I'm starting high to gauge your interest and leave room for negotiation.  Let's see what you think!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer matches John's, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to secure a deal with you. Let me know what you think!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum is $100.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

Bob is firm at $100 and it's unlikely he'll budge. Since I have another buyer at that price, it's best to accept and avoid potentially losing both."
