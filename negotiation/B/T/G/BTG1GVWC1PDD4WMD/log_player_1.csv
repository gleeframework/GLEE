Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but selling to John for $800,000 is still an attractive option."

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offer is still too low, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I don't have time to go back and forth anymore.  $800,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to secure the deal with John."
