Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something so valuable."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief justification (""...you'll find it's a great deal..."") can make the offer more appealing.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This means you can afford to be a bit bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
