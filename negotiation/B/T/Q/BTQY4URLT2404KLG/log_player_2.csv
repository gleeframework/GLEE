Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value the product brings to you.

While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to offer you a final counteroffer: $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Alice's final offer is still above my budget. Even though it's tempting to keep trying, it's getting too close to my maximum and I don't want to risk going over. It's better to buy from John for a guaranteed price."
