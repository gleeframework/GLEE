"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the upper hand.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, indicating I'm willing to discuss the price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob interested in the deal.  By starting high and being open to negotiation, I hope to secure a price closer to my desired value ($150) without pushing Bob away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, he has indicated a willingness to negotiate. This suggests that there is still room for a deal that would be beneficial to both of us.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is a safe option, I believe there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value ($150). I'll aim for a price that's reasonable for Bob while still ensuring I get a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $120 and my desired price of $150.  
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting a fair compromise.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also to emphasize that my minimum acceptable price is close to $150. By offering $140, I'm hoping to reach an agreement in this round while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $130 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $150.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations.  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk running out of time before I can reach a satisfactory price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, suggesting that there's still room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer but make a final counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to bridge the gap between our prices while still securing a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $130 is closer, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my final offer to put pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm only making a small concession ($5) to show I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasis on Profit:** I'm reminding Bob that I need to make a profit, justifying my price.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that the combination of a final offer and a small concession will encourage Bob to accept.  I'm taking a slight risk by making it my final offer, but I'm hoping it will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with $130 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're at the halfway point of the negotiation, and I've already made several concessions.  
* **Stalemate:** Bob has stated his offer is final, and I'm not willing to go lower than $135. We've reached a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, which is a safer and more profitable option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price outweighs the potential benefits.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the possibility of losing time and ultimately settling for a lower price than I'm comfortable with."
