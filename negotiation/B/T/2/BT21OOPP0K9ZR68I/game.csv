"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point. $7,500 is a bit closer.  However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  How about we compromise at $8,000?  It's a win-win for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
