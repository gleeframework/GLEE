"Alice, thanks again for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95.  This is a good compromise and I think it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $95, which is $97.50. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",97.5,Alice,5,
