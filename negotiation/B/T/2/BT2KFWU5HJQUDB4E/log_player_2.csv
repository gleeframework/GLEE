"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights and I wouldn't want to see it go to someone who doesn't recognize its full potential.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
