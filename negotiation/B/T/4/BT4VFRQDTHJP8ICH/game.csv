"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is more than fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,800,000 is beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is far greater, especially considering its potential to transform your operations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's unique worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but $1,600,000 remains beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part and  demonstrates my serious interest in this product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.  To be frank, $1,400,000 is a tough pill to swallow for a product of this caliber.  However, I value your business and want to see this deal through. My final offer is $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant investment for me.  I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
