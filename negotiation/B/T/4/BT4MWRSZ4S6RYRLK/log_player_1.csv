Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm asking for $1,199,999.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Plausible:**  $1,199,999 is a very high price, but it's still slightly below your guaranteed sale price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product immediately.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency that might push Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer, you won't lose money. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit by seeing if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
