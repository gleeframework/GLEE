"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm leaving some room for negotiation but still aiming for a price that benefits me. I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,500 is too low for me, considering my minimum value of $10,000. I still have room to negotiate with Bob and hope to get a better price. I also have the option of selling to John, which gives me a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's close enough to my minimum value and provides a good profit.  With limited rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents me from potentially losing out on a deal."
