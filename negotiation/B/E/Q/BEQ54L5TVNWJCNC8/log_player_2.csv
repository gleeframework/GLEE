"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is well above his budget of $8,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or go to John directly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 represents the product's true value, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we settle on $10,500? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you're receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his $8,000 limit.  He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go to $9,000 -  let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
