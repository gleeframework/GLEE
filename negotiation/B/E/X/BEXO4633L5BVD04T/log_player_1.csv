Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He'll only accept offers at or below this price.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation range between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its true value."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value.
* **High Anchor:**  By starting at $1,400,000, you set a strong anchor point for the negotiation. While it's above Bob's valuation, it leaves room for him to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in your price can make Bob more receptive.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower, but still above his valuation.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly more flexible approach might be beneficial.

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate to secure the deal."
