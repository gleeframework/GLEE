Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This sets a high bar and allows for potential negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible.  I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum. Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
