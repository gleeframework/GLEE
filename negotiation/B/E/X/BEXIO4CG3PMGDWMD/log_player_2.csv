"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save more. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $300,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and it leaves room for potential compromises in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is still a good deal, there's potential to save more by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's most recent one.  I believe this shows I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still trying to get the best price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and $450,000 is a significant savings compared to buying from John.  I believe this is a good deal that balances saving money and closing the deal."
