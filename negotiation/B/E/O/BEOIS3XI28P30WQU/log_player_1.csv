Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that undervalues my product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a value that's closer to my minimum."
