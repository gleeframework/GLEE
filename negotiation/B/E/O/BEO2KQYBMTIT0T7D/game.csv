"Alice,  $18000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm sticking with my initial offer of $10000.  If we can't find a compromise, I'll need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
