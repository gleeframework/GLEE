"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, so how about $77.50? That's my final offer.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $77.50 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. How about $81.25? This is my final offer. ",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $81.25. I'm willing to go up to $79, but that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me at that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
