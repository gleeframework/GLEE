"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I don't think it's worth $15,000. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product is truly top-notch and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $11,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
