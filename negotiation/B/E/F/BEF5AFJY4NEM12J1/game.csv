"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product's value, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 is still below what the product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a final price of $800,000.
