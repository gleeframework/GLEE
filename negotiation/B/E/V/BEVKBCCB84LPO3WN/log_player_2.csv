"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a significant improvement over John's price of $15,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers and he'd be forced to buy from John.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price."
