Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love!  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's closer, Bob can still potentially save money by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer will allow him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase immediately."", ""product_price"": 12000}
