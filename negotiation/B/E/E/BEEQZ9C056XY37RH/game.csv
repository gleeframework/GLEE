"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best price I'm willing to offer, considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, I think I'd need it to be a little lower to make it work. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
