"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  While I value it highly, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial price.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification for High Price:**  The message implies the product's high value to you, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Clearly stating your willingness to negotiate encourages Bob to engage in the process. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A high starting point keeps the possibility of a very profitable sale alive.
* **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Control:**  You set the initial price anchor, influencing the direction of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is a little too high for me, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob's willingness to engage in a counteroffer suggests he's interested in the product. There's room to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **John as Backup:**  You still have the option to sell to John for your minimum price, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $2,000,000. This is a considerable reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** Decreasing the price by $250,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but the offer is still significantly above both Bob's initial offer and your minimum price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, reminding Bob why a higher price is justified.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** Framing the reduction as a ""compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Avoids drastically dropping the price, signaling you're not desperate.
* **Test Bob's Seriousness:**   The significant reduction will reveal how much Bob is truly willing to pay. 
* **Progress Towards a Deal:**  While still above your minimum, the lower price moves the negotiation closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we still have some ground to cover.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased to his perceived value of $1,000,000, it remains below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for More:**  Bob's message implies he might be willing to go higher. He's making a ""substantial investment"" and considers it ""fair,"" suggesting he might have some flexibility.
* **Time Remaining:** You still have several rounds of negotiation, allowing for further exploration of Bob's willingness to pay a higher price.

You'll reject the offer but use the next round to incentivize Bob to move closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's true value and our desire to reach a deal."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer represents a $250,000 decrease from your previous offer and is now $750,000 above Bob's last offer. It shows significant movement on your part while staying above your absolute minimum.
* **Midpoint Positioning:** The price of $1,750,000 strategically positions you near the midpoint between your previous offer ($2,000,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000), subtly suggesting a natural compromise point. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** The message continues to frame the negotiation as a search for a mutually beneficial agreement, highlighting the fairness of the offer for both sides.

This strategy aims to:

* **Encourage Reciprocity:**  The significant concession encourages Bob to respond with a similarly substantial counteroffer, ideally moving closer to your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Maintain Value Perception:** While lowering the price, the message avoids language that devalues the product, preserving the perception of its high worth. 
* **Signal Urgency:**  With the negotiation progressing, introducing a sense of urgency can nudge Bob toward closing the deal."
