"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is a little too high for me, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $2,000,000. This is a considerable reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we still have some ground to cover.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's true value and our desire to reach a deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
