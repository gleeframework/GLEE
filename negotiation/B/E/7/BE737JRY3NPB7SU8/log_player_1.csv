Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum of $1,200,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at that price, making it the most logical decision."
