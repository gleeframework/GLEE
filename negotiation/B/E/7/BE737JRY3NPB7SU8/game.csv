"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
