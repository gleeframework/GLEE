"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $22,000 is closer to the product's true market value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $15,000 is a fair offer, but I was hoping to get closer to $17,000. How about we settle at $16,000? This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
