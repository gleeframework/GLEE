I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my desired price point.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or sell the product to John if necessary."

This deal has gone on long enough, and Bob's offers keep decreasing.  While I'd love to close a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go much lower than $960,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
