"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, well above my minimum price of $1,000,000. This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering $1,500,000 gives me a good buffer for potential counteroffers and allows me to make concessions without falling below my minimum.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start aggressively and gauge Bob's interest. If he counters, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine my next move based on his perceived value for the product. If he rejects the offer or his counteroffers are too low, I can always turn to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a ""Sell to John"" Decision:** While $1,200,000 is a good deal, I'm not yet ready to settle.  I want to explore if I can push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. This allows me to test the waters and potentially achieve a more favorable outcome.  I'll also keep ""selling to John"" as a fallback option in case the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $1,350,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product. If he accepts, it's a good deal for both of us. If he rejects, it gives me more information about his perceived value and helps me strategize for future rounds.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's counteroffer, I'm aiming to close the gap and see if we can reach an agreement. If he rejects, I'll further analyze his potential value and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping ""selling to John"" as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  Bob's offer has only increased by $50,000 from his previous counteroffer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still a significant amount below my initial offer.
* **Potential for More:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since we're already halfway through the rounds.  
* **Risk of ""Selling to John"":** Accepting Bob's offer would be a good deal, but it's not the best possible outcome. Selling to John would guarantee the minimum, but it might be too early to give up on a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  I will try to find a compromise that gets us closer to a price we both agree on. I'm not going to accept his offer yet, but I'm also not going to rush to ""sell to John"" just yet.  I'll see if I can secure a more favorable price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle Again:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, but still below my last counteroffer of $1,350,000. Offering $1,300,000 keeps the negotiations moving forward, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Time is Ticking:** We're at the halfway point, and I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal done.
* **Maintaining Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to accepting a price in this range.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway again, I'm aiming to build momentum and pressure him into a deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess my strategy and possibly consider ""selling to John"" in the later rounds if a favorable deal doesn't materialize."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation process. 
* **Small Gap:** The gap between our desired prices is now only $25,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  While I'd like to push for a higher price, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to sell to John for a lower price is becoming more likely.

**Strategy:**

It's time to be pragmatic. While I'm not thrilled with $1,275,000, it's a decent price, and I'm running out of time.  I'm choosing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale and getting a lower price from John."
