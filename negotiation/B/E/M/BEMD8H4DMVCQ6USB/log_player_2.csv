Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your concerns about the initial price.

This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a slight concession from my initial offer. I hope this is a more reasonable compromise for you.

Alice has indicated that $800,000 is her absolute floor, and she's offering a price of $795,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting at $795,000 secures a decent discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
