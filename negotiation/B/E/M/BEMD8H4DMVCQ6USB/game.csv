"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $950,000. I believe this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I understand this product holds significant value; however, I believe $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your concerns about the initial price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle a bit lower. Would you be open to $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a slight concession from my initial offer. I hope this is a more reasonable compromise for you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
