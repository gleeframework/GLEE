"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 isn't a terrible price, you can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. She might come back with a second, lower offer closer to her own perceived value of $12,000. 

Even if she doesn't budge and you have to buy from John, you'll only be paying $500 more. It's worth the risk to potentially save a larger amount of money."
