# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely get it for even less.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a win-win deal. However, I have to prioritize getting the best value for my product. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price. What do you think?

Bob is still in a strong position. He knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, and Alice is willing to sell for less than that. There's still room to negotiate a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000.

This is a good deal for Bob. While he could continue to negotiate, he's already gotten a good price ($950,000) significantly lower than his maximum value ($1,500,000).  Further negotiation might not yield a substantial improvement, and it risks Alice walking away or Bob losing the product to John."
