"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  Since I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, I'm comfortable starting with a price that leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a more realistic price considering his previous rejection. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This will guarantee me a profit, and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
