"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you and your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll reach a stalemate or Alice will eventually refuse to lower her price any further. Since John is offering the product for my maximum budget, it's the most financially responsible decision to buy from him."
