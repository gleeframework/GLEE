"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price as well. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.
* **Buying from John:** While this is an option, it's not the most ideal as it's Bob's full budget.
* **Counteroffer:** There's room to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $10,500 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still above Alice's desired price of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being within Bob's budget.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also firm about his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000, which is still above Bob's ideal price but within his budget and a better deal than buying from John.
* **Counteroffer:**  While Bob could counteroffer, there's a risk of Alice rejecting it and making further concessions less likely.
* **Accepting:** This offer provides a good balance between saving money and getting the product.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
