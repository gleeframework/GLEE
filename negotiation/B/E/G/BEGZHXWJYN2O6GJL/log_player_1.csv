"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $10,500 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to see him showing interest, his offer is still below my minimum.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
