"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents her offer as fair, you have no reason to believe you can't get a better price. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down to a more appealing price or proceed with purchasing from John at your established acceptable price."
