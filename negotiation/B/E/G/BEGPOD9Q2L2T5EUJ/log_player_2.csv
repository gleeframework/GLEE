"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price, as his goal is to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer allows him to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While there's still potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and ultimately needing to buy from John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
