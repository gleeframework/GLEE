Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is framed as an exclusive opportunity, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value. His response will indicate how much he's willing to pay."
