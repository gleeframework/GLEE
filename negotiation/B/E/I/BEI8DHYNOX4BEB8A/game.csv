"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $975,000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
