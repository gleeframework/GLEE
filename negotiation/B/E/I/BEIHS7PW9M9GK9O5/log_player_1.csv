"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to me.  I'm confident it will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. I'm hoping to secure a good profit, but I'm also prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer, but I'm always ready to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still aiming for more.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
 
I'm still confident that Bob will see the value of the product and come closer to my price. This is a significant concession, but I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the value I'm offering.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering both our interests.  It's time to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
 
I'm getting closer to my target price, but I need to keep Bob engaged. I'm aiming for a win-win situation, and this final offer shows my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $980,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that I'm running out of time.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing out on a good deal. I'm going to accept John's offer."
