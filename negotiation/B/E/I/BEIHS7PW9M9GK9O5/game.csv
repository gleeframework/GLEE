"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the value I'm offering.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering both our interests.  It's time to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
