"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to meet your asking price. Considering its worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,400,000 is a significant profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counter-offer acknowledges the value of the product to me, suggesting he's willing to pay a premium. I'll aim for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit on my price, demonstrating my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1,650,000?  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm aiming to meet Bob somewhere in the middle. This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,650,000 is a bit steep. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,500,000 secures a $500,000 profit, which is a good outcome. It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in subsequent rounds."
