Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe this gives me room to negotiate while still achieving a good profit. 

I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer and try to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully a more reasonable price for Bob. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a good margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  The negotiation seems to be going nowhere, and I'm confident John will purchase the product.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
