Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm not willing to drop that low yet.  I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a lower price, but still aim to get closer to my desired value."

Round 4

# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my target. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
