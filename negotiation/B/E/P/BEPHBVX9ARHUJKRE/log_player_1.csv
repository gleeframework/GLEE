**Reasoning:**

While we're still above our minimum, waiting any longer is getting risky. Bob is consistently moving up, and we're getting closer to a reasonable compromise. Accepting at $1,900,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether."
