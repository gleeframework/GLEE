"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  $950,000 is close to Bob's maximum, and there are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling that Bob is serious about negotiating. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation, while still being a good deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but it shows she's willing to compromise.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's better to continue trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This is a fair offer that benefits us both.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price. This counteroffer is a small step up from his previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway, but still below her current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a fair price,  and it gives you a significant advantage.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and her offer is now getting closer to Bob's target.  However, it's still a bit high.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to keep pushing for a lower price. There's still time to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I'm still aiming for a lower price, and I'm willing to pay $880,000.  This offer is in the middle of our last two, and a good starting point for a final agreement. Let's reach a deal!"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying persistent in his negotiation.  He is offering a price that is right in the middle of the last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward,  while still leaving a bit of room for Alice to make a small concession in the next round."
