"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's be realistic - I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you say?
