"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $1100000? I'm confident this price will be a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $950000. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's be realistic - I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $975000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",975000.0,Bob,6,
