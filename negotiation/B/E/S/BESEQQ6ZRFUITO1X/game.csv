"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $1350000, which still reflects the value of the product for you. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $1260000 is still not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1280000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's the best I can do. We both know that this product is worth more to you than that, so let's close this deal.  If you reject this offer, we're running out of time, and I'll be forced to consider other options.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
