"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $18,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  It's a fair offer considering my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000, which is $12,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement",12500.0,Alice,5,
