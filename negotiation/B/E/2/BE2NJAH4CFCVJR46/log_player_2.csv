"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $18,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's best to reject and negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  It's a fair offer considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""considering my budget""), which could make it seem more reasonable to Alice. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to buy for under $12,000. By starting at $10,000, I have some space to potentially negotiate upwards while still staying under my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $14,000 is still more than John's offer of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm aiming for a price between her last offer ($14,000) and my previous offer ($10,000). This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Below John's Offer:**  My offer is still below my fallback option of buying from John for $12,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly to encourage a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000, which is $12,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and at $12,500 it's still more expensive than buying from John for $12,000.  There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will come down further. It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
