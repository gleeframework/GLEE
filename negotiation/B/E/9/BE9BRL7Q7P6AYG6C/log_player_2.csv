"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's something that's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm confident you'll see the same potential I do. I'm willing to let it go for $1100000. This is a significant opportunity for you to get a valuable asset at a price that's lower than its true worth. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
