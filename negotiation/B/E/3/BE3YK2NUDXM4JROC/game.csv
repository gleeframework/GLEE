"Hey Alice, that's a good start, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105? It's still a good price for you and a great deal for me.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go below $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! How about we compromise at $122.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll make sure to throw in some extra perks.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $122.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $115.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though! How about we try $118? It's still a good deal for you, and I'll make sure to throw in some extra perks.",118.0,Alice,5,
