"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This serves two purposes:

1. **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A low counteroffer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
2. **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to gradually increase our price and find a middle ground.

It's a balancing act between trying to get a good deal and not lowballing to the point of offending Alice and ending the negotiation prematurely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to our budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. We can try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** We are incrementally increasing our offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic positioning:** This offer is still below John's price, but closer to Alice's revised offer, indicating a desire to find a compromise. 
* **Call to action:**  By calling it a ""competitive offer,"" we encourage Alice to consider it seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This is a good compromise and will ensure a win-win scenario for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our target price of $8,000, matching John's offer. There's no benefit in continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price. It's a win-win scenario, and it's time to close the deal."
