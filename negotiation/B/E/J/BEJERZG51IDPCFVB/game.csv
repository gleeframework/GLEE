"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find some common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go lower than $12,500. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but no more. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
