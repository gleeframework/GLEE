Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go above $12,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a significant discount on the true value of this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firm at $12,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
