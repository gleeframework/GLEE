"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I could consider a price closer to $600,000.  Would that be workable for you?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
