I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his perceived value of the product might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to settle for the minimum yet. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  Although it's only slightly above John's offer, I'm hoping to get the sale finalized.  I'm not willing to risk going another round and possibly ending up with nothing."
