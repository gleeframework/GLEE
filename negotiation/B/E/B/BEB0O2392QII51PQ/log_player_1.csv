Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's maximum value.
* **Shows confidence:** It demonstrates that you believe in your product's worth.
* **Is polite and encouraging:** It invites Bob to engage in the conversation.

However, remember that this is just the beginning.  You'll need to be flexible and adapt to Bob's responses to maximize your profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer you $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $1,100,000 is still a profit for you, it's significantly less than what you could get from John. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price or sell to John for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer:**  Shows you're listening and willing to compromise.
* **Proposes a middle ground:**  Offers a price that's closer to your minimum but still attractive to Bob. 
* **Maintains a positive tone:**  Remains polite and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward."
