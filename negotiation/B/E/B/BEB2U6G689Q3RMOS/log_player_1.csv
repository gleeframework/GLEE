"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,200,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 4
