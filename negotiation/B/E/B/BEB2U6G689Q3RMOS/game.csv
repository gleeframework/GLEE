"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,200,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
