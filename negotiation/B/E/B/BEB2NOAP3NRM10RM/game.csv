"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be significant to you, but based on my assessment, I am not willing to pay $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value the product brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident the product's value will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to take a small risk to make this deal happen.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1280000, Bob. I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint between our last two offers, which would be $1290000. I'm not budging from this price, so please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"I've been patient and flexible, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll meet you at $1282500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1282500.0,Alice,9,
