"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of getting a better price from Alice or choosing to buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate but also sets a strong starting point.  I'm aiming for a 25% discount, which is a reasonable starting point for a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not yet ready to accept $900,000.  I believe a lower price is still possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. This is a middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current offer, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price quickly."
