"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer of $70. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $80, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  I'm hoping to quickly establish a lower price point and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but $90 is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $75. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but still trying to keep the price lower. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is closer to my desired price point, but it's still above my limit. Since I have multiple rounds left, it's worthwhile to try and negotiate further.  I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Alice halfway at $80. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's still within my budget and a good deal considering John's offer of $100.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while keeping my limits in mind. It's likely Alice will accept this offer, given her previous offer of $95."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is the same price as John's offer. While it's possible to continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept my counteroffer, and I could end up with no deal. To secure the product at a reasonable price, I'm going to buy it from John."
