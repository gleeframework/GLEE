"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product will bring you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit lower than that. How about $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product will bring you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet your minimum price, but I'm still a bit far from that. How about $1050000 is too low, but I'm willing to meet you at $1075000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and my minimum of $1200000. I'm counteroffering at $1185000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product will bring you.",1185000.0,Alice,7,
