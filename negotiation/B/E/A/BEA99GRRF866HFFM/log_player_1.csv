Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a good deal (saving $5) while maximizing your potential profit. You are leaving some room for negotiation, but not too much that you risk losing the sale to John."
