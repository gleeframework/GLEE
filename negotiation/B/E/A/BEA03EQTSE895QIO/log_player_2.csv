"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know holds significant value for you. While it's worth at least $1200000 to me, I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its worth to you. I'm offering it to you for $1450000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $1,450,000.
* John is offering the product for $1,500,000.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you can still buy the product from John for a slightly higher price, but it's still within your budget and gets you the product. You'll save $50,000 compared to buying from John."
