Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** This high starting price allows me to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Worst-case scenario:** Even if Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000. 

This approach balances the risk of losing a sale with the potential for a higher profit."
