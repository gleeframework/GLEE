"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me and what I believe I can get.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $800,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
