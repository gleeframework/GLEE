"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,000,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
