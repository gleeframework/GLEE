(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left and Alice's offer still above Bob's maximum budget, it's time to make a decision. Bob is now facing a tough choice:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This would be a slight savings compared to buying from John, but it's still above Bob's ideal price.
* **Reject Alice's offer:** This would leave Bob with only one round to negotiate and a high chance of not reaching an agreement with Alice.
* **Buy from John:** This is the safest option. Although it doesn't offer the best price, it guarantees Bob will get the product at a price within his budget.

Given the limited time and the uncertainty of reaching a better agreement with Alice, Bob decides to purchase the product from John for $800,000. It's the most reliable way to secure the product within his budget and avoid the risk of a failed negotiation."
