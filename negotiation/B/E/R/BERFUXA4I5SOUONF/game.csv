"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm around the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about considering $15000 for the product?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I have to say that $15000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $16500 price point. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,5,
