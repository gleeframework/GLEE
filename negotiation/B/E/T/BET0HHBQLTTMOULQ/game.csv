"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is fair considering my maximum limit and its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it and my initial offer.
