{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer that still leaves us with a substantial gain. It positions the product as high-value while being potentially palatable for Bob given his perceived value of $800,000.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of urgency and importance, potentially swaying Bob towards a decision in our favor. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for an extra $100,000 profit over our guaranteed sale makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
