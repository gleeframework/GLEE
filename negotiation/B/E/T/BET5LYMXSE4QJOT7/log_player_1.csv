{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($100) as possible.  I know Bob values the product at $80, so I'm starting high to see if I can get him to budge. I'll also be prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a great deal, and you'll be getting a great product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm trying to find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $82. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $82 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to $90.  If he won't budge, I'll just sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $86?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 86} 
```

I'm offering a final compromise at $86.  This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $82. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been firm on his offer of $82, which is still below my minimum.  I've already made several concessions and it doesn't seem like he's willing to budge. Rather than continue negotiating and potentially getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with, I'm going to sell to John for $100.  It's a guaranteed sale and it meets my minimum."
