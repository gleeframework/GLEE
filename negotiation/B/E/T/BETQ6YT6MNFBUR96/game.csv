"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $10500. Can you consider that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $11800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can accept it.",10500.0,Bob,6,
