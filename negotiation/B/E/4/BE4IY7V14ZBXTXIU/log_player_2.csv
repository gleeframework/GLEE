{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum of $12,000. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations, leaving room for potential compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's ideal price but still lower than her initial offer. Bob can try to further negotiate, hoping to get closer to his desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below his maximum.  This counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer, potentially increasing the chances of acceptance."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now approaching Bob's maximum price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high. Given the limited rounds and Bob's goal of saving money, it's a better strategy to purchase the product from John. This ensures a guaranteed price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
