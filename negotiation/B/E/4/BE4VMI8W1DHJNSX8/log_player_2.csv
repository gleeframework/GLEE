"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You want to pay as little as possible and Alice's offer is still too high.
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a lower offer than Alice's initial price, but still above her value. 
* I'm using a polite and positive tone to maintain a good relationship while still being firm.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation in the next round if Alice rejects my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $9,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a great price for a product worth so much to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but still above my ideal price.
* I still have 7 rounds of negotiation left, so there's time to try and get a lower price. 
* I'm willing to pay up to $9,000, so there's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,250. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's still slightly lower than Alice's offer, but higher than my previous offer.
* I'm emphasizing that this price would be a good deal for both of us, making it less likely Alice will feel pressured to reject my offer.
* I'm using a polite and positive tone to maintain a good relationship."
