"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $11,250? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it allows us to both get a good deal. ",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $11,250 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Bob,6,
