Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum $10,000, but you're not being greedy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a higher value for the product, so he has incentive to negotiate. 

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer or to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my desired price. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer.  Hopefully, this compromise will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what I'd ideally like, but it's a good compromise. Accepting this offer will mean earning a significant profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
