"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product, and I'm excited to share it with you. I believe you'll find it very interesting. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to save as much as possible, and buying from John for $1,500,000 is still within your budget. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,300,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's too early to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price. I believe this price reflects the product's value to both of us and will allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,285,000, but I need you to meet me halfway from here. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is getting very close to your target price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Since John's offer is $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $115,000 and is the most logical decision at this point."
