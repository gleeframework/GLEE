Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still profitable for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John who will buy the product for your minimum acceptable price if Bob declines.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's crucial to consider:

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Relationship Building:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive pricing strategy could be beneficial."
