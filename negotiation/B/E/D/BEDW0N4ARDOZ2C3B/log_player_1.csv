"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary while still making a profit significantly above my minimum. I'm confident that Bob will likely counter-offer, allowing us to engage in a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good start, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is very close to my desired price range.  While I would prefer a bit more, it's a significant profit above my minimum, and I'm concerned about risking losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures a strong sale and prevents the possibility of further negotiation delays."
