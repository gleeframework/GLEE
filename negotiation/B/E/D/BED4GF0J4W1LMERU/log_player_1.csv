{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price between $800,000 and $1,000,000 maximizes your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $925,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $75,000, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. This pricing strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the deal attractive to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest likely profit."
