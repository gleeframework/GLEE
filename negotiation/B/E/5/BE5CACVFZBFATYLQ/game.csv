"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  This product is worth a lot more to you, and $10,000 is a fair price considering that. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider it?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but I'm starting to think we might be too far apart on price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800 as a final offer. This is a very good deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.  What do you say?",9800.0,Alice,7,
