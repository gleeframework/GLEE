"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Bob should reject the offer.  It's above his maximum price point. He can make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price, or simply buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11750. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $11,750 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Since John is offering the product for $10,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John."
