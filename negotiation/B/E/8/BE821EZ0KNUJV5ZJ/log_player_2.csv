"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500.  It's worth a lot to me, but I know you're a serious buyer. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than you value it. You can get it for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
