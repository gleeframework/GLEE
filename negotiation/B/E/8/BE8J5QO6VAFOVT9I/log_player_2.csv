"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($12,000) and Alice's own valuation of the product ($15,000). It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $10,000, we're anchoring the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a price that would be a good deal for us.
* **Expressing Interest:** We don't want to completely discourage Alice, so we express continued interest in the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We phrase our counteroffer in a way that suggests flexibility and invites Alice to make a counter-proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $14,000 is still above both your budget and her own valuation. You have room to negotiate further. Alice meeting you ""halfway"" is also a tactic, as the true halfway point between your offer and her initial offer is actually $14,000 (not between your offer and her valuation). You should aim to push the price closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** We continue to move towards a mutually agreeable price without drastically changing our offer. 
* **Justification:**  By stating that $11,000 would be fair for both parties, we subtly remind Alice that her own valuation of the product is lower than her current offer.
* **Maintaining Interest:** We still haven't hit our walk-away point of $12,000, so we remain engaged in the negotiation while aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is still a good deal for me, but I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500. While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000.  It makes more sense to take the sure deal with John than to risk Alice not budging further and potentially losing out on the product altogether."
