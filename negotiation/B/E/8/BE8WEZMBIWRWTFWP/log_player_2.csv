"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Since you have a maximum price of $150, rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $100? I'm really keen on this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good deal considering I was initially hoping for $100.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
