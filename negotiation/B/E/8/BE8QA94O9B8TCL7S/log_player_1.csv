{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum value ($15,000) but allows room for negotiation. It's also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving him incentive to negotiate.  I'll be ready to either accept a counteroffer or make another offer depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than $12000.  I'd be happy to pay $8500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's also quite a bit lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be able to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,250? This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. It shows willingness to negotiate and hopefully leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my minimum value. It's a significant jump from Bob's last offer, but hopefully, it's appealing enough to prompt a positive response."
