"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, you know you can get a better deal from John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the option of getting a lower price open."
