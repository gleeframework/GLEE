"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $12,000 is a bit low for the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $12,500 is close, but I have a bottom line to consider too. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,875?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",12875.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $12,500 again. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,6,
