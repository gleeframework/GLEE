"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $13,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
