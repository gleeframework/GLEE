"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a significant discount from my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  given the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still within my acceptable range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $800,000. Would you consider $725,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not acceptable. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a significant concession on my end. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm offering my absolute minimum price, hoping Bob will accept. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution, but also highlights that I'm not willing to sell at a price that's significantly below my minimum."
