"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to acquire the product, but I find the price a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is a reasonable midpoint between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I appreciate that. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works well for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000, as that would be below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle at $812,500? This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price. Would you consider $800,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
