Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still represents significant value to Bob (saving him $50,000 compared to your alternative).
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price slightly higher or lower."
