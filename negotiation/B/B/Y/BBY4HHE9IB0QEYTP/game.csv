"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000, which is a fair market value considering its worth to you is $8000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the product's worth to me, I'm only willing to go up to $8500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is your maximum offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $10000, I can meet you halfway at $10000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. Let's try to meet in the middle, as you suggested earlier.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $9500. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $10000.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your continued efforts to meet me halfway. I'm willing to go up to $9250. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. ",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $9250, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $9750. It's my final offer, and I hope we can meet on this price.",9750.0,Alice,7,
