"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiations often benefit from anchoring. By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you establish a higher potential selling point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample room for you to make concessions throughout the 10 rounds while still aiming for a final price well above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will give you valuable information about Bob's eagerness and flexibility.  His response will guide your strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,200,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer represents his perceived value, accepting it would leave a significant amount of money on the table. You know the product is worth considerably more to you.  It's too early in the negotiation to settle at his initial offer. You'll counter in the next round, aiming to bring him closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're signaling willingness to negotiate by making a substantial decrease from your initial offer.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** The new price remains significantly higher than Bob's stated value, providing room for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on him to make a more compelling offer.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  You're aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value to you, ensuring you don't undervalue it in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to your minimum acceptable price. However, accepting $1,400,000 would still mean leaving $100,000 on the table. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aiming for a price closer to your true valuation while still engaging in the negotiation process. You'll counter in the next round, aiming for a smaller concession to see if Bob is willing to move closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to the mark. To demonstrate my commitment to finding an agreement, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** You've lowered your price by $100,000, a smaller step than in the previous round. This signals that you're approaching your bottom line while still being open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** You're reiterating the product's inherent value to justify the price point. This keeps the focus on the product's worth rather than simply haggling over numbers.
* **Putting the Ball in Bob's Court:** By making a smaller concession, you're prompting Bob to make a more substantial move if he's serious about securing the deal. This round will give you a clearer indication of his willingness to meet your price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll be left with John's offer, which is also for $1,500,000. 

It's a good business practice to secure a deal when a buyer meets your predetermined minimum. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale and avoids the potential for losing the deal altogether."
