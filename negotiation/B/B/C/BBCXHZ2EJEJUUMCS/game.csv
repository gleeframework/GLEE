"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. $9,750 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
