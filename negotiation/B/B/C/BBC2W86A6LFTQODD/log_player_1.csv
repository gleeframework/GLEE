Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  A price of $140 leaves me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still earning more than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that I have an alternative buyer (John) willing to pay $150 gives me leverage, but I'm not using it immediately.  I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I need to counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price. Even though John is willing to pay $150, there's no guarantee that I can't get a better deal with Bob. 
* **Building leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's counteroffer shows him I'm serious about getting a fair price. This might encourage him to compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  $125 is still above Bob's offer, showing that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  I've included a positive message to encourage Bob to accept this offer.  

This counteroffer is designed to  keep the negotiation going while still ensuring I get a price that is reasonably close to my minimum acceptable price."
