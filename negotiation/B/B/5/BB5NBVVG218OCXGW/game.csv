"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting price is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $950,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go with $962,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",962500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",960000.0,Bob,6,
