Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a bit lower than your reserve price of $15,000 but still higher than Bob's value of $12,000. This gives Bob a potential profit and you still get a good price. You are strategically leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to haggle, but you are confident that you can still get a higher price from John if Bob rejects."
