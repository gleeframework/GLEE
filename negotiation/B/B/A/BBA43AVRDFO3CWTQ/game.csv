"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise again, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come up a bit more. How about $975,000 and we have a deal?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come up on the price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'll meet you at $1,025,000, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
