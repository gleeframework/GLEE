Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $17,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you're willing to work with Bob.
* **Creating Value:** The message highlights the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, aiming to justify the price.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice can still aim for a price above her minimum.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright.  However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having a guaranteed sale option."
