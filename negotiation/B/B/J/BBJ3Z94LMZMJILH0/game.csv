"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is a fair price considering my maximum and your minimum. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $14,250?  This is a small compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about $13,750? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",13750.0,Bob,6,
