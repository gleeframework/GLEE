"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation.  I'm prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response. However, I'll keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested, and his counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial $8,000 value.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. I'll aim for a price that's reasonable, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'll need to be mindful of the limited rounds remaining, but I'm not desperate enough to accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer is Reasonable:**  $10,500 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not giving away the product for cheap. 
* **Focus on Value and Compromise:**  Highlighting the value to Bob while also showing my willingness to compromise with a counteroffer makes this a win-win situation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's in the middle ground. This gives Bob a chance to come up from his offer without feeling pressured, and it also allows me to still get a decent price without needing to sell to John immediately. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer than previous offers, I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that low.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  We've already established a range, and with a few more rounds, I might be able to get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob, especially with the remaining negotiation rounds.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counter Bob's offers, aiming for a price closer to my $15,000 minimum.  I'll focus on emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and showcasing my willingness to negotiate further. I'll also need to keep a close eye on the remaining rounds to ensure I don't miss out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 simply isn't enough for me.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for us. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  This counteroffer represents a slight compromise from my previous offer of $10,500, showing flexibility without drastically lowering my price.
* **Focus on Compromise:** Emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect might make Bob feel more inclined to accept the offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage continued negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that will satisfy both of us. I believe $10,000 is a good price for both parties. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to be more decisive in the remaining rounds. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't sacrifice too much for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,750. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's a closer offer than before, it's still not enough.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I need to carefully consider my options. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my target. I'll need to be realistic about my chances of getting a higher price, but I'm not giving up just yet. I'm also going to weigh the risk of selling to John against the potential of reaching a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing hard on the price, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, and both of us can walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is the midpoint between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's current offer ($9,750).  
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to emphasize the win-win aspect.
* **Urgency (Slight):**  I'm using a phrase like ""Let's close this deal"" to add a slight sense of urgency without being pushy.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to find a compromise that both Bob and I can agree on. This offer shows flexibility without sacrificing too much. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a bold move and propose a price of $9,000, but I'll throw in a bonus: I'll also buy an additional product from you for $1,000. This way, you'll get a total of $10,000 from me, and I'll get the product I need. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the last few rounds, and Bob's offer, while including a bonus, still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Uncertain Future:**  It's uncertain if Bob will accept any higher counteroffer in the remaining rounds. The additional product offer is a good attempt at a compromise, but it doesn't guarantee a deal that meets my minimum needs.
* **John is a Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed deal that fulfills my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:**

With limited time left and the risk of further negotiations not yielding a better price, it's prudent to take the guaranteed offer from John. While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still not enough to justify the risk of losing a secure sale.  I'll prioritize my minimum price and move forward with John."
