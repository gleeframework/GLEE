Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This reflects its fair market value and is a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product from you directly rather than going through John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
