# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob and Alice, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and a price I can comfortably accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer of $8,250 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
