"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This reflects its fair market value and is a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and a price I can comfortably accept.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product from you directly rather than going through John.",8000.0,Bob,4,
