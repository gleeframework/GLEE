Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, Alice is anchoring his perception of the price to a higher value.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed $8,000 from John. This makes $10,000 a strong opening offer to potentially gain an extra $2,000."
