"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $9,500.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me and considering its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. This seems like a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price from $9,500 to $9,000.
* This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000.
* Accepting this offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* There is a risk that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice might not come down further, and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
