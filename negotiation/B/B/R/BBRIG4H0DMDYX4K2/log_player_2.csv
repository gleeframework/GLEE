"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. You can save $50,000 by going with John. Alice is trying to convince you that her product is worth a ""premium price,"" but you have a better alternative."
