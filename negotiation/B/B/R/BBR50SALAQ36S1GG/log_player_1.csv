{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** I'm signaling to Bob that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.
* **Adding value:** Mentioning that I think Bob would appreciate the product creates a positive association and potentially increases its perceived value to him.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. 
* If Bob counteroffers, I'll consider his price and my own willingness to sell at that price.
* If the negotiation stalls or looks like it's going nowhere, I'll move to selling to John for $100 to secure at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  Bob's interest in the product is clear.  I can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Exploring options:** By rejecting his offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and have the chance to potentially find a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still acknowledges his budget constraints. 
* I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response.
* If the negotiations stall or look like they're going nowhere, I'll move to selling to John for $100 to secure at least my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would still be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** $120 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value of $100. 
* **Show flexibility:** By coming down from my initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Reinforce the value of the product:** Mentioning the ""value of the product"" again subtly reminds Bob of its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* I will monitor Bob's response closely and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If Bob accepts, I'll happily sell the product to him. 
* If he rejects again, I'll have to carefully consider his counteroffer and my own willingness to negotiate further. 
* If negotiations seem unproductive, I'll move to selling the product to John to ensure I at least meet my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $100 is my absolute minimum value for the product, so accepting his offer would at least guarantee I don't lose money.
* **No further room for negotiation:**  If I reject this offer, I'm risking further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **John's offer is the same:** Selling to John would yield the same price, but I'm already in a good position with Bob, who seems genuinely interested. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the transaction with Bob and sell him the product for $100. 
* I've achieved my minimum goal of earning at least $100 for the product."
