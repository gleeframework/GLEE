"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'll sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
