Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth millions in the right hands. I'm offering it to you first, at a price of $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** While I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob is crucial.
* **Perceived Value:** My message emphasizes the product's potential value (""worth millions""), subtly anchoring Bob's thinking above a million dollars. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value. If he accepts, I win big. If he rejects, I haven't lost anything and can still sell to John. 

This strategy is about maximizing potential profit while still having a safety net."
