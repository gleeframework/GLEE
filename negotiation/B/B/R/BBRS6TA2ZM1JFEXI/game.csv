"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the potential of this product, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,650,000, which reflects a fair price for its value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still confident in the initial value I presented. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true potential of the product while still acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $2,000,000 is still out of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $1,800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. I believe this represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's value.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, which is a reasonable compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
