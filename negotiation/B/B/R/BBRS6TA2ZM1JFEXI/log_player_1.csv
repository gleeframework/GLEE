Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the potential of this product, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,650,000, which reflects a fair price for its value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $2,000,000 is still out of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $1,800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, which is a reasonable compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my minimum that it makes sense to accept and avoid the risk of him lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's offer later."
