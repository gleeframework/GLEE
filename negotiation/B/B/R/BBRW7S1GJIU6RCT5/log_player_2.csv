Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm offering my absolute maximum budget of $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also reaching the limit of what I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, as it's the best I can do. If she doesn't, I will likely have to buy the product from John."
