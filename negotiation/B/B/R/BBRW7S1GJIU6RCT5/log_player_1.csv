"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price than John's offer, while still ensuring a good profit. I'm curious to see if Bob is interested at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While $750,000 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a price that's closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial desired price. I'll reject and counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is another compromise, slightly lower than my last offer but still higher than Bob's.  I'm hoping that seeing my willingness to negotiate will push Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum.  There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer, so I'll reject and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a final compromise, very close to John's offer. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to close the deal, as it's likely he won't get a better offer from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  It's the same price I can get from John, so there's no benefit in continuing to negotiate or going to John. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
