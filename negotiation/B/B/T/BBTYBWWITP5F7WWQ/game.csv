"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and your need to sell. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
