"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, and the alternative option of buying from John for $800,000 is always available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and your need to sell. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still too high. Bob should reject the offer and continue to negotiate. With 7 rounds remaining, there's still room to try and get a better deal.  The option to buy from John for $800,000 remains a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable at $900,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still too high for Bob, who wants to save as much money as possible. While Bob has the option to buy from John for $800,000, there are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $885,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it shows my sincere interest in acquiring this product.  Let's make a deal and close this out."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $885,000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $915,000. This is the absolute highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $915,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of further negotiation are slim. It's better for Bob to secure the product at John's price of $800,000.  This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially wasting more time on negotiations that might not result in a lower price."
