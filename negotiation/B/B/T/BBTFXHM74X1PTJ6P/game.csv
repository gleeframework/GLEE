"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $14,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still giving you a significant discount on its true value to you.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
