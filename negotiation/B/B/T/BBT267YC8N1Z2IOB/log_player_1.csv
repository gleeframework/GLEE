Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum and still a good profit.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn."
