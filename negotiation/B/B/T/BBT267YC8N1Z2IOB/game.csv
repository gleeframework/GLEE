"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get a great value from this product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,250? I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it.",12250.0,Bob,4,
