"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. This leaves room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer:** You can try to lower the price by making a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Buying from John is not the best option yet:**  While you have the option to buy from John for $150, you can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** This price is still above Alice's value of $80, making it a potential compromise point. 
* **Negotiation:**  By starting with a lower offer, I'm aiming to initiate a back-and-forth negotiation to reach a price that's good for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial price, $110 is still above my target of $100.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a better price. I'll reject this offer and continue to try and lower the price.
* **John's offer remains a backup:**  While I want to get the best deal, I still have the option to buy from John for $150 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm increasing my offer from $100 to $105, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Close to Target:**  This price is still within my target range, and only slightly higher than my last offer.
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer creates pressure on Alice to accept or risk further rounds of negotiation, potentially with a lower offer from me."
