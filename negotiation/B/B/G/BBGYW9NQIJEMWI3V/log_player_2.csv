"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $700,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You can likely get a better price.
* **You have 10 rounds.** There's no need to rush into a decision.
* **John's offer is a benchmark.** You know you can buy the product for $800,000, so you have a clear goal to negotiate lower than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm eager to finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $675,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and would be happy to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to negotiate.** This is a good sign, and she's getting closer to your target price.
* **You still have time.** With 7 rounds left, there's room to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is your safety net.** You know you can get the product for $800,000, so you can be patient and see if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. While $675,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping to finalize a deal at a slightly lower price. I'm ready to offer $660,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 660000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $670,000. I believe this price still represents a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm but has moved closer to your target.** Her offer is only $10,000 higher than your last counteroffer.
* **You're nearing the halfway point.** With 5 rounds left, it's likely you'll have difficulty getting a significantly lower price.
* **John's offer is still a fallback option.** You can always purchase from him, but you're getting closer to a good deal with Alice. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer saves you $130,000 compared to buying from John.  The potential for further savings is limited with the rounds left."
