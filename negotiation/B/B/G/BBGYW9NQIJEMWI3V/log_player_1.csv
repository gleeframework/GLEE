Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm eager to finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Bob's offer:

I'm ready to offer $660,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win scenario.
