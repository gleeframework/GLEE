"Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $12,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a significant discount.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still out of my range.  I'm happy to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
