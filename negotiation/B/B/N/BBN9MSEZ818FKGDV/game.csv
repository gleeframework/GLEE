"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I believe you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $9000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $9000 and $7500, which is $8250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider $7800? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7800. I'll make a new offer that's closer to your target, but still a bit above my minimum. I'll offer the product to you for $8500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.",8500.0,Alice,5,
