# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and your interest, I propose a special introductory price of $7,500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $7,500, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a fallback option, Bob should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, it's still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My revised offer is $7,200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $7,200, still above Bob's desired price but closer to his budget.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He's already shown he's willing to walk away, giving him leverage.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is still a backup option, but Bob should explore further negotiation with Alice first."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm getting closer to a price that works for me, I'm still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm ready to pay $7,100.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you at $7,150. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $7,150, which is the lowest offer yet and within Bob's budget. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject and he'd be left with John's higher offer. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still a backup, but Alice's offer is the best deal Bob has seen so far. 

It's generally good to accept a deal that's close to your budget when there's a risk of losing the deal entirely."
