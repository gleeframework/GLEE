"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's of great value and would be perfect for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. You can always buy from John for $150 as a last resort."
