# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to revolutionize your business operations. I believe it could be invaluable to you, given its worth of $1,500,000 to you. Let's discuss how we can make this valuable asset yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counteroffer at $1,125,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our respective positions and I believe it offers a fair value for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further.  It's a good compromise, and it's still significantly lower than buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best decision at this point."
