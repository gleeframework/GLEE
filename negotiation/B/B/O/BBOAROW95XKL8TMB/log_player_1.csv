"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language signals willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he can potentially reach a favorable deal. 

**Strategy:** This strategy aims to:

* **Anchor high:**  By starting with a high number, I aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Gather information:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable insights into his negotiating style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying over $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly his perceived value, and far below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a significant loss.  While selling to John is an option, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of this product.  While your initial offer is understandable, it doesn't reflect the true worth of what's being offered.  To move us closer, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000.  This takes into account the unique benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've lowered my price by $400,000, a substantial amount designed to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously.
* **Holding Firm Above Minimum:**  Despite the reduction, my offer is still well above my $1,500,000 minimum and signals that I'm not desperate to close a deal at any cost.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's unique value proposition to justify the still-high price.

**Strategy:**  My goal is to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize my willingness to compromise and respond with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.  Let's find a common ground that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,000,000, which is a positive sign. However, it's still below my $1,500,000 minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there's still a gap to bridge before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  It's clear you recognize the value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the unique benefits you'll receive."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,600,000 is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum, providing a buffer in case Bob attempts further negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's unique benefits to remind Bob of its value and justify the price.

**Strategy:** By presenting this as my final offer, I aim to:

1. **Encourage a decision:** Bob now needs to decide if he's willing to pay $1,600,000 or risk losing the deal. 
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  I'm demonstrating firmness while still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
 
I'm hopeful that Bob will see this offer as reasonable and accept. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value you place on this product, $1,600,000 remains too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This demonstrates my continued commitment to acquiring this product, and I believe this price represents a fair compromise given our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has continued to increase his offer, reaching $1,200,000, it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum.  More importantly:

* **Stalled Momentum:** Bob's increases are becoming smaller, suggesting he's reaching his limit.
* **Final Offer:** I already presented my ""final offer"" in Round 5, and going back on that weakens my position.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John provides a certain $1,500,000.  Continuing with Bob risks a lower final price or no deal at all.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further concessions."
