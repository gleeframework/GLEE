Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still making a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still making a profit and are open to negotiation.
* **It's a clear signal:** This shows Bob you're serious about selling but also willing to compromise.

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate and possibly even go lower if needed, but always keep your minimum value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $8,000. Would you consider selling it to me for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've reduced my price, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still not going below my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** Reminding Bob of the product's value strengthens my position.
* **Clear Offer:** This leaves no room for misinterpretation and encourages Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $8,750 is still significantly lower than my desired price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and less hassle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than $9,250.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects the true value of the product.  If you're genuinely interested, this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a firm price, signaling this is my last move before selling to John.
* **Emphasize Value:** Again, I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Compromise:** I've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.

This counteroffer puts the ball in Bob's court. If he wants the product, he needs to decide quickly before I sell to John."
