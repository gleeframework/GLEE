"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $1,075,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1075500.0,Alice,7,
