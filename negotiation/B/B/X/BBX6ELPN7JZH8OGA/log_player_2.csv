"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a price of $15,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not worth accepting this offer. You should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $8,000.  You should reject this offer and try to get even closer to your desired price.  You can still counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there at $12,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice isn't willing to come down to a price you're comfortable with.  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for your maximum budget of $8,000."
