Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice gets a great price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" can create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While Alice could start higher, asking for a price too close to $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a fair deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches Alice could take, depending on her risk tolerance and how much she wants to prioritize selling to Bob."
