{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

This offer splits the difference between your minimum acceptable price and the estimated value to Bob. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer, but $9,250 is still a bit much for me. Could you do $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is only $250 below your desired counteroffer, and it's already $750 higher than what you could get from John.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most financially beneficial in this situation."
