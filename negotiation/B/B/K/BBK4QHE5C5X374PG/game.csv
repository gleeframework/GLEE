"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for offering, Alice! I appreciate the pitch, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90.  Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. How about $97? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.",97.0,Alice,5,
