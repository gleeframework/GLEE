"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find it a great value. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
