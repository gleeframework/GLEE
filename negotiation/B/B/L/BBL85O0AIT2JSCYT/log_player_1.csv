"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $13,000? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let's find a solution that makes us both happy.
