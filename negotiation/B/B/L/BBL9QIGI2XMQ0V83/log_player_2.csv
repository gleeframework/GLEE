"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it would be valuable to you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to bluff you. She states she'll sell it to another buyer for $12,000 if you don't accept her $12,500 offer. Since the product is only worth $12,000 to her, it's unlikely she'll find another buyer at that price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This may lead her to lower the price or you can buy from John for a better deal."
