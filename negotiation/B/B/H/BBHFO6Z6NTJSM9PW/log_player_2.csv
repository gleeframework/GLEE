Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100. I can do $115, which is the best I can do. I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you.

Alice is clearly signaling she won't budge much more.  While we could try for a slightly lower price, it's risky. Accepting at $115 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the $150 fallback."
