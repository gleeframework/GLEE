"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above what I need to receive.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above her minimum desired price ($1,200,000).** This means there's still room for negotiation. 
* **You have a better alternative (John) at $1,500,000.** This gives you strong leverage.
* **Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially get a better deal.** You can aim for a price closer to Alice's minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,350,000? This way, we can both walk away happy with a fair deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $1,350,000.** This is still within your budget and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **You have already countered and been rejected once.** This signals that Alice is unlikely to go much lower.
* **Accepting the offer saves you time and potential hassle.** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a significantly better price. 

At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product while saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
