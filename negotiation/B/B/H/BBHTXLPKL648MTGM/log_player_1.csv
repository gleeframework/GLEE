"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm open to compromise, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120, but it's closer to my desired range. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $107 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $109 for it. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109} 
```

I'm going down to $109, which is just above my minimum. I'm making this my final offer, hoping to push Bob to accept. I'm also emphasizing that this is the best I can do to encourage him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to pay $106 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I'm not making much profit here, it's better to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum price than to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially as we're approaching the end of the rounds."
