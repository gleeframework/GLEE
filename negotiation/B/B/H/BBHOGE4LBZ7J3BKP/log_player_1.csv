"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll be interested in it. My asking price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above what I know Bob values the product. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Opening:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question at the end invites Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation:** I want to try to get closer to my desired price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:**  While $100 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to John immediately. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I need to be closer to $100 to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my position, highlighting the value of the product and why I need to be above $90. 
* **Open-Ended:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking ""Would you be willing to..."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my ideal price.
* **Potential for Higher:** I believe there's still room to negotiate for a slightly better price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I want to keep the negotiation going in hopes of securing a higher price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While $100 is safe, I'm not desperate to sell to John right now. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $92.50 is still a little low for me.  How about we compromise at $94? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still keeps the price above my minimum. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making it seem like a win-win.
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product to encourage Bob to see its value.

**Note:**  At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $93. How about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left to negotiate. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I keep rejecting and Bob backs out, I might end up with only John's offer of $100, which is what I could have accepted now.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer of $93 is a good compromise, as it's a reasonable price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
