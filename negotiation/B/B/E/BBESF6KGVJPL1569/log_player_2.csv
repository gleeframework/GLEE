"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offering. How about $1050000? This is a fair compromise, and it would still leave you with a substantial savings compared to your original estimate.  Let's keep the negotiations going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,050,000 is a better price than John's, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his goal."
