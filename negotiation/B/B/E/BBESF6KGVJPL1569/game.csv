"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay closer to $950000. This would still give you a healthy profit and is a significant saving for me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offering. How about $1050000? This is a fair compromise, and it would still leave you with a substantial savings compared to your original estimate.  Let's keep the negotiations going.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1050000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Bob,4,
