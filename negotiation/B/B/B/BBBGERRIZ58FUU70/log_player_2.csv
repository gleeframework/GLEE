"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the high value I place on customer satisfaction. I trust that you will find the product worth every penny. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's product might be great, $120 is significantly more than your $80 limit and what John offers. You can get the same product for a much better price by going with John."
