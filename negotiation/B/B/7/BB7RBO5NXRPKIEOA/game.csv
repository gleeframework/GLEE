"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $11,500 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
