"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. $500,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

Let's start with a significant counteroffer.  $400,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price. This will test her willingness to negotiate and hopefully get us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $450,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above our target. We should continue to negotiate for a lower price. Let's try to push for a price closer to our initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

Let's meet Alice halfway. $425,000 is a reasonable compromise between our previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows we're serious about closing the deal, but still looking for a good value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $437,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $437,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly firm on her price, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation. At this point,  $437,500 is a good deal, especially considering our fallback option with John is $800,000.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
