# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?
