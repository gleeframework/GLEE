Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and Open:** The message is friendly and emphasizes that I'm willing to negotiate. This encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm offering a price that's relatively close to my minimum but leaves some space for compromise. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially finding a price that's mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Although Bob is willing to negotiate, it's likely I can get closer to my minimum price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer at $150 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and have a chance to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:** $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's still within a range that Bob might find acceptable.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and friendly tone, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, increasing the chances of a successful deal while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 above my minimum acceptable price of $110. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to his initial offer.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit that is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate, where we both refuse to budge, leaving me with a product I can't sell at my desired price.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit that is within my acceptable range, minimizing risk and maximizing my earnings."
