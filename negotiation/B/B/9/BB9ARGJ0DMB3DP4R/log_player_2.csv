"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget and you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price.  This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer, indicating she may be willing to go higher.  It's still a good deal for you, but continuing the negotiation gives you a chance to potentially secure a lower price. There's still room to bargain and potentially get a better deal than $925,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to meet her halfway. It's still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, and leaves room for further negotiation.  This counteroffer balances pushing for a better price while showing flexibility and increasing the likelihood of an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to your desired price range and is significantly better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower, and the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation."
