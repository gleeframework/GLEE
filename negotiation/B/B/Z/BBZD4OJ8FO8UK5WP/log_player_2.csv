{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a strong price considering its potential.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go above my $800,000 limit. I'll counter with a lower offer and see where we can meet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your commitment to this deal is clear.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to drop to $1,150,000. I believe this price represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating, aiming to get the price down to my limit of $800,000. I'm going to counter with a lower offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
