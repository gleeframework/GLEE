"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a strong price considering its potential.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is slowly increasing his offer. We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate and can likely get him closer to the $1,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your commitment to this deal is clear.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to drop to $1,150,000. I believe this price represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. I'm proposing $900,000 as a fair compromise. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. I am confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments now. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000, especially with only 4 rounds left. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price."
