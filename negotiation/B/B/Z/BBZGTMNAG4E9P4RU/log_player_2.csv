Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you're placing on the product.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,100,000.  Since you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from him."
