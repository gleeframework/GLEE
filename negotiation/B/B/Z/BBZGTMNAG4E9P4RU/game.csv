"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you're placing on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
