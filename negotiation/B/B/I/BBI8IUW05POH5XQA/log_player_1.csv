Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and gives Bob room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get as much as possible, but I'm also prepared to accept a lower price if Bob is willing to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is more than my absolute minimum, I'm not happy with that offer. I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $85. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, this will be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation, as I can sell to John for the same price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
