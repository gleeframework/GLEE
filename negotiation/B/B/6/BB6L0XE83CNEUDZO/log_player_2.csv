"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
``` 

This counteroffer is closer to Bob's maximum value, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It's a reasonable offer that might be accepted by Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to come down further, and it's worth trying to negotiate one more time.  If this offer fails, Bob can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

This is Bob's final offer, as it's his maximum value for the product. If Alice rejects, Bob can then buy the product from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not willing to come down in price, and her latest offer is even higher than her previous one. It is time for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $80."
