"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is still higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $875,000. This would be a good compromise and allow us to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this final:  $887,500, and we have a deal. This reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your desire for a fair price.",887500.0,Alice,5,
