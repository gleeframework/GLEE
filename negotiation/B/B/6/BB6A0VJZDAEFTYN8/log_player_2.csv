"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice. If negotiations fail, Bob can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $800,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $900,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a substantial savings if the deal goes through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it saves him $150,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always the chance of negotiating a lower price, there's also the risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob will be forced to buy from John at the higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good price and avoids potential risk."
