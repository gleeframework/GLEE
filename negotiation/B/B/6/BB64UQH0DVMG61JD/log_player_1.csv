Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision soon, as there's significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Scarcity & Urgency:**  The message subtly implies there are other interested buyers, creating a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he hesitates. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The language focuses on the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price without explicitly revealing its worth to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Depending on Bob's response and your risk appetite, you might adjust your approach in a real-world scenario with multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
