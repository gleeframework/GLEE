"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a compromise at $980,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I can offer you a price of $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
