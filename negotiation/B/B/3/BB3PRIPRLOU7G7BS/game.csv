"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, even more so than the standard valuation might suggest. I'm offering it to you first, at a premium price of $2,000,000. Given its unique value, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment for someone with your keen eye.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $2,000,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my spending limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the true value and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my spending limit. This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
