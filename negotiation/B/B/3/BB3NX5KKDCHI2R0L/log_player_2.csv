"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,150,000. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high for Bob's desired price range.  It's worth exploring if a lower price can be negotiated before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to close a deal that benefits us both. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a lower price in the next round. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still more expensive than what Alice is offering, so it's not the best option at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is now within Bob's budget and is significantly less than what John is asking.  While Bob can continue to negotiate, it's getting close to his desired price, and there's a risk of losing the deal if he rejects. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within his range."
