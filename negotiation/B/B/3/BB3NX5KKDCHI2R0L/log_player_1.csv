"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to close a deal that benefits us both. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
