Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  While a simple ""take it or leave it"" approach is possible, providing a reason for the price (even if vague like ""great deal for the value"") can sometimes make the offer more palatable.
* **Alternative Implied:** By mentioning you have other potential buyers, you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't take the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a price he might accept, knowing the product's value to him."
