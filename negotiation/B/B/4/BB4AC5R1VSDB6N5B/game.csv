"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
