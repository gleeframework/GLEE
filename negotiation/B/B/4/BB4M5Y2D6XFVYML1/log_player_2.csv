Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11000, which is still a good deal for you, and gets me closer to my target price. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $11500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  I've negotiated with her for a few rounds, but I'm not confident I can get her down to my price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John instead."
