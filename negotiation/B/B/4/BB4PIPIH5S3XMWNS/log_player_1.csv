"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to give myself room to negotiate. This is a good starting point as I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and this leaves room for both of us to potentially come to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can still get a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to move forward.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a better deal. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
