"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  My starting price is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, my budget is limited to $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market conditions and similar products available. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see you're eager to work with me. While $800,000 is a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a little.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I believe this price is fair given the product's value and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered your proposal and while I appreciate the compromise, I'm still not able to meet you halfway at $950,000. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,4,
