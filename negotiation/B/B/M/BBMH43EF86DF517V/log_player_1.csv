Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's worth the price, but let me know if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, I've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, it indicates interest. If he outright rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at $80.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
