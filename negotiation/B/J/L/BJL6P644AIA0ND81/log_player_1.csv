"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping he'll value the product enough to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is more than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, and we can close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is getting closer to my desired price. It's still a bit lower than I hoped, but I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for $120. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
