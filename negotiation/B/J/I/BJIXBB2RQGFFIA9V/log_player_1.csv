"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My starting price is $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $100, I'm confident he'll be willing to pay at least that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just too low. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, which would be $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum price of $100, and I've already rejected two of his offers.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John if I reject again, but I'm willing to close this deal now to avoid further negotiation."
