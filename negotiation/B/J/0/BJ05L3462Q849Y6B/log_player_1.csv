"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I establish a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and set the stage for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price gives me ample room to negotiate downward while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces the high price and encourages Bob to seriously consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer for the product is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, I still have room to negotiate.  Bob offering his full perceived value right away suggests he might be willing to go higher. I'll aim to bring him up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While that price doesn't reflect the full value of this product, I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,875,000?"",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while firmly stating it's below value demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Compromise:** The new offer is a significant drop from the initial price but still well above both Bob's valuation and my minimum.
* **Justify the Price:**  Framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" positions the new price as a fair compromise, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,625,000. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching up, but his ""best offer"" statement is likely a negotiating tactic. I'm still significantly above John's offer and have time to apply a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've done some calculations based on the value this product can bring, and I can go as low as $1,725,000. I believe that's more than fair and reflects the true potential of what we're discussing."",
""product_price"": 1725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This counteroffer is a smaller drop than before, signaling I'm reaching my lower limit. 
* **Value Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value aims to draw Bob's focus away from the price and towards potential benefits.
* **Firm but Fair Tone:**  The language suggests this is a strong offer without resorting to ultimatums, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am willing to offer $1,675,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's final offer is a significant $175,000 above John's guaranteed price, securing a substantial profit.
* **Finality:**  Bob has labeled this his ""final offer,"" indicating he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now locks in a very favorable deal."
