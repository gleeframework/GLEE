Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings justifies the price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will be telling. If he outright rejects the offer, it might mean he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have the security of John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This reduces your risk if Bob declines your offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during the negotiation if necessary, but don't go below your $15,000 minimum."
