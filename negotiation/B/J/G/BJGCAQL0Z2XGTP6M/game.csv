"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $16,500. How about we settle on $15,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
