Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation and makes the offer appear more attractive.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice cannot reveal she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. Doing so would significantly weaken her negotiating position with Bob."
