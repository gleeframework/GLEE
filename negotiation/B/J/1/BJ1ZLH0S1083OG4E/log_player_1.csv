Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I consider the product's minimum value to me. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to negotiate since he values the product at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up with a more attractive offer.  However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm confident I could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob rejecting further offers is too high. Selling to John ensures I get my desired value and avoids further negotiation."
