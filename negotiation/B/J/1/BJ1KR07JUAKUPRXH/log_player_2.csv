"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be a great fit for your needs. We're offering this exceptional item for $950000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Starting Point:**  Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer to establish his negotiating range. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets a low anchor price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $700,000 is still a sizable amount, giving Alice room to make concessions.
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message emphasizes Bob's genuine interest, while acknowledging the price difference. This helps build rapport."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. To better align with your budget, I am proposing to reduce the price to $825000. This still reflects the value we place on the product, while making it more accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised price works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $800,000 limit.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further.  There are still rounds left, and he can always buy from John if a deal isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with the price reduction. I'm still a bit higher than my budget allows, but I'm willing to go to $800,000.  This is my absolute final offer, as it aligns with my financial constraints.  Let me know if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob establishes this as his final offer, putting pressure on Alice.
* **Justification:** He links the price to his budget, reinforcing his limitations.
* **Directness:** The message is concise and avoids unnecessary pleasantries, focusing on the price. 
* **Focus on Agreement:** The message concludes by focusing on reaching an agreement, conveying a willingness to close the deal."
