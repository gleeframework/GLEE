"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:**  $115 is still lower than my minimum value of $120, ensuring I won't be losing money.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone sets the stage for a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $105 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate, as Bob clearly values the product at least $100, and I'm willing to go as low as $120.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $120 is tempting, it's too early to abandon the negotiation with Bob. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Staying Flexible:** $110 is a reasonable compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $108?  That's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While $108 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.
* **Room for More Negotiation:**  We've only had four rounds.  There's still a chance Bob might come up a bit more, especially if I show I'm firm.
* **Selling to John is Risky:**  While $120 from John is tempting, I could potentially get a better price from Bob by continuing the negotiation.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay $110, or even closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $108 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference -  $109.  This way, we can both be happy with the transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" situation for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While I'm offering a lower price, I'm not giving in completely. I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum."
