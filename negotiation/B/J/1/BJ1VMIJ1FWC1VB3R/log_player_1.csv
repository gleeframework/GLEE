Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob's valuation is lower, starting near your minimum acceptable price anchors the negotiation high. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price allows for some back and forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique opportunity"" and ""value,"" you subtly imply the product is worth a premium. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:** If you anticipate Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher. 
* **Time sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower offer might be more appealing.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a (small) incentive to buy now rather than risk you selling to John."
