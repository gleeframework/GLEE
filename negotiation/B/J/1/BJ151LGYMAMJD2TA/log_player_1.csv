"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $17,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  If he rejects, we can start to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $16,000.  This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $14,000, which is close enough to my minimum of $15,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price. I'll accept his offer."
