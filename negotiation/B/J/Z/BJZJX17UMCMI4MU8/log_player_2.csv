"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000, which I believe is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget. Bob has a clear goal of spending no more than $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from your end. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to stay within his $1,000,000 budget. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not acceptable. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a fair midpoint between our last offers. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're making progress. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint again, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000, which is the same price you offered. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is a great price, Bob is still trying to stay within his strict $1,000,000 budget. With only 3 rounds left, there is a high chance that Bob won't be able to negotiate a lower price. Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at the fixed price of $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
