Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $200.  I'll counter with a price closer to that in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, hopefully encouraging him to accept while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get $175,  $160 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
