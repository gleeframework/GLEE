"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to see how much wiggle room there is. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming for a price well below my $100 maximum, leaving space for potential counteroffers while still being a potentially acceptable profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could you meet me halfway at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice's counter-offer suggests she's willing to move on price. While $85 is closer to her value, it's still above my target. 
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:**  There's a good chance we can settle somewhere between $70 and $85, closer to a fair deal for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $78? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
 ""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm aiming slightly below the exact midpoint between our last offers ($77.50 would be the direct middle). This shows willingness to move while still pushing for a good deal.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason like ""fair compromise"" can make the offer feel more reasonable and persuasive to Alice.
* **Staying Competitive:** I'm keeping in mind that John's $100 offer is my fallback. This offer is still a better deal for me."
