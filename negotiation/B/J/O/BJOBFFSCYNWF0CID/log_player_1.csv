Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will counter with a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I want to maximize profit, offering $100 (Bob's maximum) leaves no room for negotiation and could lead to an immediate rejection. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  By mentioning the product's value to Bob, I'm emphasizing why he should be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own perceived value ($100). There's a lot of room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would leave a lot of money on the table.  I'll counter-offer in the hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could you meet me halfway at $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $85, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($70) and my initial asking price ($95). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and encourage agreement.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm staying firm above my minimum price of $80. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where we both feel good about the final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $78? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to my desired range. At this point, the potential gain from continuing with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed $80 I can get from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
