"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, you can potentially get an even better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's no harm in seeing if you can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it's designed to show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and to establish a starting point for further discussion. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will give me valuable information about her price range and set the stage for future counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. This is a good deal, and while I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer and I'll be left with the choice of buying from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and saves me time and effort in further negotiations."
