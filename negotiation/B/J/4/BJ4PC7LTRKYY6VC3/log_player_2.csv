Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move higher, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I can offer it to you for $142. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $140.  While you might be able to get her down a little more in further rounds, it's not worth the risk of the price remaining above your budget. John offers a guaranteed price of $150, which is a reasonable outcome at this point."
