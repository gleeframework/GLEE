"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal you're offering, I'm looking to spend no more than $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price? ",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $15000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $17500?  This would still give you a great price, and it would ensure I get a fair value for my product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $16250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",16250.0,Bob,4,
