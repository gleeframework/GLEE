"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is still less than what he would pay John, and it's a good compromise in the negotiation."
