"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I understand you want a good deal, but I'm only willing to go down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's something we can both agree on. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you accept. If not, I'll have to buy from John.",12000.0,Bob,6,
