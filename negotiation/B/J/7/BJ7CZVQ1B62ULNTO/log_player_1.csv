Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000, a price that reflects its unique qualities and the potential for significant returns.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks promising, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so it's worth pushing for a higher price.  I can still make a decent profit at $1,200,000, but I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that we're both eager to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's try to reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and the price is getting closer to my target.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
