Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! How about $1,275,000? It's a compromise on both our ends, and I believe this is a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise and gets me the product for a price lower than John's.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's risky as we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will continue to budge.  Accepting this offer is the most practical choice at this point."
