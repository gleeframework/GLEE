Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $120. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $120 from John."
