"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $1,000,000 and still save money.  There's no reason to buy from Alice at this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $900,000?  That leaves room for both of us to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $950,000, Bob still saves a significant amount compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away or counter with a price closer to her initial offer, and he'd lose the chance to buy at a lower price."
