Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's more than Bob's valuation but less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a price that we both feel is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500. This is still a decent compromise, closer to my desired price, and hopefully, enough to make Bob reconsider his offer."
