Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000, but am open to discussing a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects it, you can lower the price. If he negotiates, you know he's serious.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
