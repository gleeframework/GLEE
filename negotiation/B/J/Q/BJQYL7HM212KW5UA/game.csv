"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82.50 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to pay $80 for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $2.50 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $81.25. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",81.25,Alice,5,
