"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $15,000 is closer, I'm still a bit far off from that. Could you do $12,000?  I'm hoping we can find a good middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
