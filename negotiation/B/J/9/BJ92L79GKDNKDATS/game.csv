"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $225. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",225.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $210, so I'll meet you halfway between $210 and my previous offer of $220. I'll sell the product to you for $215.",215.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $215 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up by $5 and meet you at $210. Would you consider selling the product to me for $210?",210.0,Bob,8,
