It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and take John's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely further negotiation will get the price close enough to your desired outcome.
* **John's Offer is Solid:** Accepting John's offer guarantees you $800,000, which is your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob prolongs the sale and delays you receiving payment.

While there's a chance you could squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away or the additional time investment."
