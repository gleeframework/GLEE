"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
