"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 from John, Bob can likely negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject the next counteroffer and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids any further negotiation."
