"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her $8,000 valuation."
