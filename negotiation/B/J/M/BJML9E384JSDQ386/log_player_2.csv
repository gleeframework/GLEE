"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, accepting the initial offer of $15,000 is not ideal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John at this point is the same price as Alice, so there's no advantage to doing so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (40% off) shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal. This should encourage her to counter with a more reasonable price while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  You have 7 rounds left, and there's a chance you can get Alice down further. Buying from John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to come down, but we're still $1000 apart.  A counteroffer of $11,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.  This leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've come a long way from the initial price of $15,000. Alice is now offering $11,500, which is only $500 more than your last counteroffer. At this point, with 5 rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will yield very small gains.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a reasonable price, and avoids the risk of Alice getting more stubborn and increasing the price again.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse deal."
