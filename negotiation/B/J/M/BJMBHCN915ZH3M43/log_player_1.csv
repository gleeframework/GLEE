Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes a perceived high value.
* **Alternative Option:** Highlighting John's offer (without revealing the price) subtly creates a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower, but not below $16,500 to ensure a worthwhile profit. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Your goal is to get as close to $18,000 as possible while still securing the sale."
