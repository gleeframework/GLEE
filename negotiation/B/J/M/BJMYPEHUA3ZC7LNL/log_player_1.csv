Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts, as this offer stands for a limited time."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) provides room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification of value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price without revealing your minimum.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning a ""limited time offer"" encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously and potentially avoid losing out.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $200,000 less than your guaranteed price with John allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob before resorting to your backup option (John)."
