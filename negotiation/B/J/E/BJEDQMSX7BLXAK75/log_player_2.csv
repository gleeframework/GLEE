"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer Rationale:**  Bob is trying to strike a balance. He's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product, but he's also pushing for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Message Tone:** The message is polite and constructive,  acknowledging Alice's offer while expressing Bob's desired price. 
* **Next Steps:** By counteroffering, Bob sets the stage for continued negotiation. He's hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're serious about this product.  While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I could be persuaded to go down to $14,000. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. He's made progress, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Value to Alice:**  Bob knows that Alice is willing to sell the product for less than $14,000 (her value is $12,000). 
* **Risk of John:**  Bob is still wary of buying from John for $15,000, as there is still a chance to get the product cheaper from Alice.

**Next Steps:** Bob will try to continue negotiating with Alice to try and reach a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:** Bob is sticking to his previous offer, showing Alice that he's serious about this price point. 
* **Fairness Argument:**  Bob is reminding Alice that $13,000 is a fair compromise, as it's closer to her perceived value and within his budget.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This strategy aims to push Alice towards his desired price by emphasizing the fairness of the offer. 
* **Next Steps:**  Bob is hoping that by reiterating his offer and highlighting its fairness, he can persuade Alice to accept it."
