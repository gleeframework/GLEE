"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. It's important to leave room for potential compromise while still demonstrating the product's value."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, it's a long shot to think he'll come up from there. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price, hoping to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before running out of rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get him to come up closer to my minimum price. I still have time to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it will encourage Bob to increase his offer.  We're getting close to the end of our rounds, so I need to find a solution that's acceptable to both of us."

With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will come close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee a safe and profitable deal."
