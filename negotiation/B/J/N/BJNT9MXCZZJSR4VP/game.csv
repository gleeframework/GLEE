"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but  $700,000 is the highest I'd be willing to go.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is your maximum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going that high.  Would you consider $760,000? That's a firm offer.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $760,000 is your firm offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",795000.0,Alice,5,
