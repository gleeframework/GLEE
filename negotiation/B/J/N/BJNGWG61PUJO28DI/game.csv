"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
