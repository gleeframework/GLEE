"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly higher than your lowest acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects the initial price, his counteroffers are likely to be higher than if you had started lower. 
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  Starting high gives you the flexibility to make concessions in subsequent rounds, which can foster a sense of reciprocity and encourage Bob to agree to a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low. Accepting would mean a significant loss compared to selling to John. While his message suggests flexibility, it's unlikely he'll immediately jump to a price acceptable to you. It's worth a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate him upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Fair Counter:** By jumping straight to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000), you signal firmness. However, framing it as ""meeting halfway"" softens the blow and suggests fairness.
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the product's benefits reinforces its worth in Bob's mind, potentially making him more willing to stretch his budget.
* **Gauge Seriousness:** This counteroffer will quickly reveal how serious Bob is. If he's unwilling to move significantly from $6,000, it might be time to walk away and consider John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $12,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is my absolute maximum budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $8,000 is his absolute maximum budget. This suggests he's unlikely to go any higher, even with further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you your minimum acceptable profit. It eliminates the risk of Bob refusing further offers and wasting valuable time.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only six rounds remaining, the potential upside of continuing negotiations with Bob is outweighed by the certainty of John's offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk a worse outcome later."
