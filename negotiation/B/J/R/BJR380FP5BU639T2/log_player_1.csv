Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum value.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation and potential for a win-win. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially move up from there.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
