"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
