Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point considering my minimum is $12,000 and Bob values it at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Benefit Framing:** I'm highlighting the value the product offers to Bob.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** My message is open to counteroffers,  leaving room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a decent profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations. 
* I'll keep in mind that I can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also below the value Bob himself places on the product ($8,000). Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffers:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he's still interested in the product. I believe there's room for a counteroffer that would be more beneficial to me. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have John's $12,000 offer as a safety net, so I can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward while also protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  However, $6,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:**  I explain that the previous offer was too low but acknowledge Bob's budget constraints. This shows I'm open to compromise.
* **Compromise:** $8,500 is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's still below my minimum and closer to the value Bob sees in the product. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and open, encouraging continued conversation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer. It's a reasonable price for both of us.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $7,250 is still below my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has made a significant concession from his initial offer. 
* **Risk of Losing a Sale:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

Even though I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations without a guaranteed outcome. I can always use this experience to negotiate more effectively in future deals."
