"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Accepting Alice's offer at $12,000 would be too expensive.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the best option, but it's worth exploring if a better deal can be made with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount. Offering $9,000 is a good starting point as it's a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and hopefully create room for a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  While it is closer to his target price, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to push for a lower price in the next round, but buying from John remains a viable option if the deal with Alice doesn't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to compromise. $9,500 is a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's latest one.  This could be a sweet spot where both parties can find a deal.  It's still a good price for Bob, and it might be attractive enough for Alice to accept, given that she is losing money by selling at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is very close to Bob's target price of $10,000. While it's slightly higher, it's still a good deal, considering Bob's alternative is to buy from John at $10,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price, and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a quick purchase at a price close to his target."
