"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal! Alice is offering the product for less than it's worth to her, and significantly less than your maximum price and what John is offering. Take it!"
