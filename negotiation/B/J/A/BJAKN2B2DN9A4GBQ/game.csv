"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $780,000, given the product's value to you. This would still be a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",780000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet in the middle at $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $740,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $760,000, as a final compromise. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to gain value from the product. Let's finalize this deal.",760000.0,Alice,5,
