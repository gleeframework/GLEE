"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers immense value, and I believe a price of $1,050,000 is a more accurate reflection of that.  This offer represents a significant discount from my initial offer and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
