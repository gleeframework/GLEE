"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a great deal for a product worth much more. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $108 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $109?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
