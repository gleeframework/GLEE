"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000.  Let's try $14,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
