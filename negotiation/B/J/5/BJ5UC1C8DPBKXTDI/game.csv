"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I believe that's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $13,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
