,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $110. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $105. This is as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $105, so I can offer you $102.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",102.5,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $102.50. I'm willing to make another concession, so I can offer it to you for $108. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $108. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider it.",105.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $105, Bob, but I'm still not sure if that's enough for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $110. This is my final price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,9,

"I understand this is your final price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I've already gone as high as I can, and I'm not willing to go any further. I think I'll have to pass on this deal and look elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
