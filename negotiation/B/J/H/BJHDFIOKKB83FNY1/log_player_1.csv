Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value to you is significant, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position.  My goal is to maximize profit, so I'll start with an offer significantly higher than my minimum.  

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Highlighting the exclusivity might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob, knowing I have a safety net with John."
