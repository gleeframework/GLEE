"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  This product has the potential to generate significant returns, and I believe its true value is much higher. How about we meet halfway at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. My next counteroffer is $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
