"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $1,025,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
