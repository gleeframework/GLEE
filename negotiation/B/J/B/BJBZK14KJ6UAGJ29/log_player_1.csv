"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so this gives me some bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm hoping to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm finally offering the product at my minimum price.  Since we're approaching the middle of the rounds, I need to start closing the deal, and this price is a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Although I'm only getting my minimum price, Bob's offers have consistently been below my minimum. We've reached a point where I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob, and it's risky to keep going. I'm worried that if I continue to reject his offers, he might walk away, leaving me with nothing.  John is a guaranteed sale, so I'll go with that option."
