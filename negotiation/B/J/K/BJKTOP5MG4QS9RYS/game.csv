"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Based on my understanding of its worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do see value in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Could you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,160,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1160000.0,Bob,4,
