"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000.  
* **John's offer:** $10,000. 

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $9,000 by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000.  
* **John's offer:** $10,000. 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Bob is offering $8,500, which is still a profit for Alice (as the product is worth $8,000 to her).  This is a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,200. 
* **John's offer:** $10,000. 

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. Bob is still better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. There is still room to get a better price, especially since John is willing to sell for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,200. 
* **John's offer:** $10,000. 

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,800. This is still a good profit for Alice, and it shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also doesn't want to go too low and risk losing the deal. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming to secure a better price than Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,400.
* **John's offer:** $10,000. 

Alice's counteroffers are becoming less favorable to Bob.  It's likely that Alice will not budge much further. Since John is willing to sell for $10,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
