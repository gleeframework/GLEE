Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another party."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could start at $1,500,000 (our guaranteed price from John), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below our guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and value. The message emphasizes this with the ""limited-time offer"" and ""strong offer from another party.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing us to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher final price. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while minimizing the risk of losing him as a buyer."
