"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer you the product for $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
