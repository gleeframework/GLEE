Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leave Bob Room to Negotiate:** A price of $19,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet you somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning listing the product publicly implies that this is a limited-time offer and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  While you want to maximize your profit, setting the price too high might discourage Bob from even countering. This strategy balances ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
