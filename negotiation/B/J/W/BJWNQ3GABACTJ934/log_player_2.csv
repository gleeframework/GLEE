Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,800. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price of $11,200 represents a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in significant savings."
