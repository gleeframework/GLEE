"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great. However, I'm working with a pretty tight budget right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $11,500 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still a little ways off. Could you do $10,800? That would really help me out.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,800. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",11200.0,Alice,5,
