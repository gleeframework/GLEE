Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and it allows me to gauge Bob's interest in the product.  If he's willing to pay a significant amount, I might even be able to get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, it's only $10,000 less than my last offer. This feels like a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
