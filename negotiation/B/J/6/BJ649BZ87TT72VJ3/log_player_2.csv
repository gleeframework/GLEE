"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. It's way above your budget.  You can get the same product from John for a much lower price, so it makes sense to start negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000, which is a compromise between your budget and the value I believe the product holds. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if you can get Alice down to a more acceptable price. You can always go with John's offer if the negotiation falls through."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While $1,000,000 is getting closer, it's still outside your preferred range. You're much better off seeing if you can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's worth the risk, especially since you have John as a backup option."

This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.

Alice is still asking for more than you're comfortable paying.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer. You can get the same product for a significantly lower price, and it's not worth risking further negotiation."
