"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to you. It's best to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $200 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is still a good price for you considering what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price."
