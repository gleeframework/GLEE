"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes no sense for Bob to accept this offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by offering his maximum budget of $8,000. This establishes his upper limit and sets the stage for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will immediately accept this offer, it's a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should increase his offer slightly from $8,000 to $8,500. This shows Alice that he is willing to negotiate but is still staying within his budget. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice his willingness to negotiate. In this round, he offers $8,750, which is a reasonable compromise between his last offer and Alice's current offer. It's important to note that Bob has only a few rounds left, so he needs to make a move that could potentially persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made no concessions in this round, reiterating her previous offer of $9,000. Bob has only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will budge from her current position. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $8,000, his maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a deadlock, and time is running out."
