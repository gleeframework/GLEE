"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. How about we split the difference at $800,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $835,000?",835000.0,Alice,5,
