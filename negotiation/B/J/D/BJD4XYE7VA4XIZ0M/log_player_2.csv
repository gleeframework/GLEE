"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll find it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, I can still try to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, and I have 9 rounds to try before I need to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, I'm only able to offer $750,000 at this time. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $900,000 to $825,000. While this is closer to my goal, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have 7 rounds left and can still make a counteroffer. If I reject this offer, it's likely Alice will come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. How about we split the difference at $800,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price that's exactly my maximum, hoping Alice will accept to avoid risking further negotiation rounds. If she rejects, I'll still have the option of buying from John, and it's unlikely she'll be willing to go lower than $800,000 considering her value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $835,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only offering $835,000, which is still above my maximum.  At this point, with only 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I've reached the point where I can purchase the product from John for my maximum desired price.  Buying from John guarantees a deal at my target price without any further uncertainty."
