Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000 gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob.

By starting at $1,150,000, I'm aiming for a price that's beneficial for both parties."
