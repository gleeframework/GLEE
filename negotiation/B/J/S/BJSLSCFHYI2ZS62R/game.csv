"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $950,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this revised offer reflects the product's value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal. While your offer is tempting, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. I believe this is my final offer, and I hope it paves the way for a successful agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $992,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",992500.0,Bob,6,
