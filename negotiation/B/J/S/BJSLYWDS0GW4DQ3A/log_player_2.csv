"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth, let's start our negotiation at $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better deal with Alice or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This offers a reasonable compromise between the value you place on it and my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us and allows for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. In light of this, I am willing to consider $9,250 as the price for the product. This proposal aims to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring a satisfactory transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept this offer. $9,250 is a good price for him, given that his maximum budget is $12,000, and John's price is $12,000. This price is also just above Alice's value of $8,000, so both parties will be happy with the deal."
