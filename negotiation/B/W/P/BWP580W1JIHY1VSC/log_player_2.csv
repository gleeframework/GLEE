"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is asking for $120. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.** There's room for negotiation as you're both willing to compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  $100 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $80, indicating a potential deal is possible. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? This would still be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  $110 is a fair price considering your maximum budget ($150) and Alice's minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Opportunity cost:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to more back and forth, potentially eating into your valuable negotiation rounds. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product and save money compared to buying from John."
