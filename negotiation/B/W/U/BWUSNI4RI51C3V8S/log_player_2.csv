"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower the price since she values the product at $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his limit. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since there's no room for further negotiation, it's in Bob's best interest to take the sure thing and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
