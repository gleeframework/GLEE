"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range for Bob. This creates space for further negotiation, but also shows Bob's seriousness about the purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product.  $9,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer, showing willingness to compromise, but still within his budget limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $10,500 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of not being able to secure a deal within his budget, and he might end up with no product.  

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price point, avoiding any further risk or potential disappointment in the negotiation."
