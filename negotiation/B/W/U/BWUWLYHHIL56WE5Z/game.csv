"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
