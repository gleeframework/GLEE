Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Considering its value, I propose a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, while still staying well above John's $800,000 offer. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps justify the high price.

By starting at $925,000, Alice leaves room to negotiate down to a price that's still very profitable for her, while still potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value enough to secure the deal."
