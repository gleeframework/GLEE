"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $14,000 is more than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still less than the $15,000 you'd pay John. 
* **Saving money is the goal:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
