"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize profit, and while I can go to John for $8,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's first counteroffer.  He's clearly trying to lowball me. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, but it's also closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, he'll see that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my desired price. We're only $500 apart now, and we're already on round 4. I'm not sure if I can get any more out of him, and I don't want to risk going back and forth too much and losing him completely.  I'll accept his offer."
