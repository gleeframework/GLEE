"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite comfortable meeting you in the middle, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
