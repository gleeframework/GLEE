"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,125?  This price is fair, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $10,125 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to settle at $9,900? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,900 is still slightly below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal and call it a day!",10000.0,Alice,7,
