"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $120 is too high for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $150, but wants to save as much as possible. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* $110 is a good deal for Bob. It's still below his maximum price of $150, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower. 
* Rejecting the offer risks further negotiation and could lead to Alice becoming unwilling to sell.  
*  Buying from John at $150 is not a better option."
