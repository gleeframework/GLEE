{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $110, which is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **John's Offer:** $120, a backup option.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price. It's likely that Alice will be willing to come down a bit to close the deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** $100. This means she has some wiggle room for profit.
* **Your Value:** $120. You have a maximum price you're willing to pay.
* **Strategy:** Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Alice Accepts:** You've successfully negotiated a lower price.
* **Alice Rejects:** You'll need to adjust your counteroffer in the next round, potentially going lower but keeping in mind your maximum value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.

* **John's Offer:** $120, a backup option.

**Strategy:**

Alice is coming down in price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  Since you're still close to your desired price point, it makes sense to keep negotiating.  By rejecting her offer, you can try to push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:** $100. She's likely willing to accept a price closer to her value.
* **Your Value:** $120. You still have room to increase your offer if necessary.
* **Strategy:**  By offering $106, you're showing a willingness to compromise. It's a small increase from your previous offer, but it could be enough to convince Alice to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Alice Accepts:** You've successfully negotiated a price within your desired range.
* **Alice Rejects:** You'll need to consider your options. You can offer a slightly higher price or choose to go with John's offer, depending on how many rounds are left."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still acquire the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $107. This is only $7 over your desired price point.
* **John's Offer:** $120, a backup option. 

**Strategy:**

While you'd prefer to pay $105 or less, Alice is showing persistence and is likely not going to budge much further. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate could result in a higher price from Alice or you ending up having to buy from John at a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* You've successfully negotiated a price that is within your budget and acquired the product."
