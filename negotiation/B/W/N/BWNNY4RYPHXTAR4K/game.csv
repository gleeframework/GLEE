"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more affordable. Would you be willing to do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,500. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",7500.0,Alice,5,
