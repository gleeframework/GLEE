"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but not ridiculously high. It leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is a slight concession from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer.  While I'd like to get closer to $14,500, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price or ending up selling to John for $10,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
