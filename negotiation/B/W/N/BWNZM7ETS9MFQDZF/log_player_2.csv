Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about $16,500? This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
