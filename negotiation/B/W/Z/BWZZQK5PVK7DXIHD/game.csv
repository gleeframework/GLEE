"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a reasonable cost.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my limit and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",875000.0,Alice,5,
