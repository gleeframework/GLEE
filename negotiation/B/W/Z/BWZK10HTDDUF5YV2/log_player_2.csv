While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's beneficial to try and get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. I think this price reflects the value you see in the product, and it's a fair compromise between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
