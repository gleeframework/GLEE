Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed that John is offering the same product for $800,000.  

* **Accepting Bob's offer** ensures you make $800,000, which is a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer** carries a risk. Bob might walk away and take John's deal, leaving you with nothing. 

While getting $1,000,000 from John is ideal, there's no guarantee Bob will counter higher, and you risk losing him as a buyer. Accepting $800,000 now is the safest move to guarantee a substantial profit."
