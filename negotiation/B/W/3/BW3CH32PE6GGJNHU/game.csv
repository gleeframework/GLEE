"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the substantial benefits you'll gain from owning it.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is significantly below my valuation, I'm willing to move closer to bridge the gap. How about we consider $1,100,000? This reflects the true value and the potential for returns you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That being said, $1,100,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be fair to both of us, I can offer $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant disparity between our valuations. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but this is my final offer. It represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering John is offering me the same product at this price. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
