"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe is fair for this product and its potential value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This feels like a win-win for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,012,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
