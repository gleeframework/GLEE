"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above our minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites discussion, signaling flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While we have John as a backup, our focus is on maximizing profit with Bob, especially since he values the product more. We'll keep John in mind as a fallback if negotiations stall significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to what we could earn. We know he's willing to pay more, so we'll counter in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe is fair for this product and its potential value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This feels like a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but clearly state it's too low. By saying ""significantly below,"" we emphasize the discrepancy.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob why he was initially interested.
* **Compromise:**  We propose a significant concession from our initial offer ($1,150,000 to $1,075,000)  to signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This framing makes the offer seem more appealing and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counter closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,012,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,012,500 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While we could continue negotiating, we're getting into diminishing returns territory. 

Here's why accepting is the best course of action:

* **Profitable Deal:** We're securing a profit of $12,500 over our minimum, which is a good outcome.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Prolonging the negotiation might frustrate Bob and could lead to him lowering his offer or walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of losing this offer and having to start over with John or another buyer.

It's better to take a solid win now than risk losing it for a potentially small increase later."
