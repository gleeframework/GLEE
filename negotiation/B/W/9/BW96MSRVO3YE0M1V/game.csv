"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm very interested in the product, $1,000,000 is quite steep.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  It's a very valuable item, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving you a significant discount.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? This offer represents a significant investment on my part and a fair compromise between our positions.",725000.0,Bob,4,
