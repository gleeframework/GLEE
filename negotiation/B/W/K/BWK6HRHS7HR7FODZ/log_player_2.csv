Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  It's unlikely she'll go below John's price at this rate. It's better to buy from John now and avoid potentially overpaying."
