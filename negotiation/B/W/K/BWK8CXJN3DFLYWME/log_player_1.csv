Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting you a significant portion of the value you're seeking. It also shows you're willing to compromise and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,500.  How about $9,400? This is a small compromise on my end, and it's a good price for a product of this quality.  I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit over my budget at $9,400.  Would you be willing to accept $9,300?  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to $9,500, Bob's offer of $9,300 is a good compromise. It's important to remember that I have a backup option in John, and this deal is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
