"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,500.  How about $9,400? This is a small compromise on my end, and it's a good price for a product of this quality.  I'm confident we can make this work.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit over my budget at $9,400.  Would you be willing to accept $9,300?  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal.",9300.0,Bob,6,
