"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but you have room to try and save some money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product.  While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000?  This would allow us to both walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.

Alice is already coming down in price, but it's worth seeing if you can get her lower.  Let's try a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $1,250,000?  This would be a good middle ground for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1280000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

We're getting close to a good price. It's worth pushing a little harder to see if we can get her down to $1,250,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,280,000 is very close to where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,265,000? I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1265000}

Round 7

At this point, Alice has come down significantly.  While you were hoping for $1,250,000,  $1,260,000 is a good price, saving you $240,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a fair compromise and avoids further negotiation that might risk the deal."
