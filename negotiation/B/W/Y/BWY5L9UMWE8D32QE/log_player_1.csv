"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my initial offer."
