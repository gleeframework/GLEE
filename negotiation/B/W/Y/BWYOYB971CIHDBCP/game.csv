"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $780,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go as low as $780,000. How about we meet in the middle at $820,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make this deal work. Let me know what you think.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I've found a better offer from another seller, and I think it's in my best interest to go with that one. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and that's the price I'm willing to pay. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
