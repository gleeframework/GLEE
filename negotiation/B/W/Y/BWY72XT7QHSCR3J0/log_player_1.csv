Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise. It also acknowledges that you value the product at a higher price than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. It's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a price that is closer to my valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to me. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price slightly closer to Bob's offer while still getting a price that is more than halfway between my initial offer and Bob's latest offer.  It's a strategic move to show I'm serious about reaching an agreement but not willing to go significantly lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's time to move on and secure a certain profit."
