"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my final offer, let me know if it's something you'd like to accept.",13000.0,Alice,5,
