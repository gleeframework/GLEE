"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if you're interested!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I recognize the value, $16,000 is still a bit over my budget. Could you do $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I can offer it to you for $15,500, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway!",15500.0,Alice,5,
