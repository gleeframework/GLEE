I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I get a good profit.  It's important to start high, especially since I don't know Bob's value for the product.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to go down from my initial price, but not that much. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering with $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves a good profit margin for me. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a better deal than his offer, while still allowing me to achieve my goal of earning more than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is now my minimum, but I can get the same amount from John without any further negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
