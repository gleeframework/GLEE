"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$60 is a good price, but you can potentially get a better deal. Since you have 10 rounds and the product is worth $120 to you, there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to make a bold move.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to start low and see if Alice is willing to compromise. If she rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffers strategically based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $55 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still not quite as low as I'd like.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I have several rounds left, and there's a good chance I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $50. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but am still trying to get a good deal.  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers. If she rejects it, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers strategically until we reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $52. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $52, which is only $2 away from my last counteroffer of $50.  Considering the time and potential for further negotiation, it's reasonable to accept this offer and secure the product. It's a good price considering my maximum value for the product is $120.  Further negotiation could take more time and might not result in a significantly lower price."
