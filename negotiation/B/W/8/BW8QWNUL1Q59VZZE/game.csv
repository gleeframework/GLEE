"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let's try to close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I really want to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. How about $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can comfortably afford.  Let's close this deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
