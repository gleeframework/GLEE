Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you consider $85? I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
