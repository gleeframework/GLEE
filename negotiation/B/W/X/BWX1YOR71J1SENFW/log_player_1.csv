Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly below your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but based on my budget, I am only able to offer $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price point. You have a backup buyer in John, and it's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to your desired range. It leaves room for a potential final agreement but also signals that you're serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $960000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to your minimum acceptable price.  While you'd prefer to get closer to $1 million, it's likely that further negotiation will be more time-consuming and potentially result in a lower offer from Bob.  Selling to John guarantees you a significantly higher price, but accepting Bob's offer allows for a quicker transaction and potentially a more favorable relationship for future deals."
