"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but $950,000 is simply not enough. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the flexibility shown. However, based on my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1,025,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which I believe is closer to the value you place on the product and within my budget range.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
