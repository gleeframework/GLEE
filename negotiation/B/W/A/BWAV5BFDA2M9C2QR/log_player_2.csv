"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still the option of buying from John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go below $950,000 for the product. It's still a significant discount from my initial price, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground to close this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget. Although it's a slight discount from her initial offer, it's not enough for me to accept. I'll try to negotiate further, but if I can't get the price down to my limit, I'll buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand your position, $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above my budget of $800,000.  While it's closer than before,  it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm confident that John will sell me the product at my price limit. It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
