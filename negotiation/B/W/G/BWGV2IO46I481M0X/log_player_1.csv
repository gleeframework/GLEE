"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a reasonable price. Considering my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $11,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal, exceeding my minimum of $10,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and maximizes my profit within the limited rounds.  Selling to John would result in a lower profit."
