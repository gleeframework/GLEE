"Alice, your product seems great, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
