I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can start negotiating from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $13,000 is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he's not, I might need to reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and above my minimum. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
