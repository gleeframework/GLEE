"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750000 is still quite a bit below what I need for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $800000? That would be a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
