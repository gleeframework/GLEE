"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a compromise to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I believe I can get closer to my target value with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to see a price closer to $1,600,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price, but I don't have much room for further negotiation. Given that I have the option to sell to John for the same price, it's safer to take the guaranteed sale."
