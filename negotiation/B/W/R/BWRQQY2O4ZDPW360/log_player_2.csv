Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your comfort zone, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the product for $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16250.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price point, and further negotiation might not result in a lower price. Since John is offering the product for $15,000, which is Bob's maximum price, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
