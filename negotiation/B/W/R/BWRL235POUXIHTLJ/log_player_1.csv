``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how much Bob values this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  I'll reject it and counter with a higher price. I'm hopeful that Bob still values the product highly enough to come back with a better counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm dropping the price slightly to $1,250,000.  This shows a willingness to negotiate, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit."
