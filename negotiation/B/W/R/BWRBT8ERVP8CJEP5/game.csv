"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $130, which is $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $120? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $120 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle at $110? It's still a good compromise considering the value of the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
