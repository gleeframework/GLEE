"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider this?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider this?",950000.0,Bob,4,
