"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price close to my minimum value of $800,000.  It's important to remember that John is always an option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price.  We have 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000. We're down to 6 rounds, and it's getting increasingly likely that I won't get a better offer. $920,000 is a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price than selling to John."
