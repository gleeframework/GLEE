"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true worth and keeps it beneficial for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
