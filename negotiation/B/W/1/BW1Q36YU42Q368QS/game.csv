"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a discount.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,100,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $1,000,000? That would work much better for my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a more comfortable price point for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
