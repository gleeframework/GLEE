"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than your maximum budget ($15,000).**
* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($10,000),** meaning there's room for negotiation. 
* **Buying from John would cost you more ($15,000).**

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John."
