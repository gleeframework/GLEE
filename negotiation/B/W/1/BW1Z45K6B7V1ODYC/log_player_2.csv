Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $750,000 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and well below your $800,000 maximum.
* **John's offer is close:** While John offers the product at $800,000, continuing negotiations with Alice might not yield much more savings and could risk losing the deal. 
* **Time is a factor:** You have limited rounds, and reaching an agreement now ensures you get the product.

Waiting any longer might push Alice away, or you might not be able to negotiate a price much lower than $750,000."
