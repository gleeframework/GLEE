Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. Can you consider that?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $20,000? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than his current offer. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
