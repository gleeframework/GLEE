"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? It's closer to my initial offer and shows my commitment to closing this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $9,100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and your latest counteroffer. I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value and my costs.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm truly interested in this product and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about $8,900?  This is a significant reduction from your previous offer, and I believe it shows my sincere desire to close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,

Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9050.0,Alice,7,
