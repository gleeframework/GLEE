"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering the maximum he values the product at, and we know this won't go any higher. While we could try to negotiate, there's a risk he might reduce his offer in later rounds. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price ($120) without further negotiation."
