Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This approach aims to maximize profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob:

* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves space for potential counter-offers while ensuring a profit above your minimum.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The price is still significantly higher than John's offer of $100, ensuring a good profit even if Bob declines. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he is willing to pay."
