"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, but also wants to be realistic. Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good deal for Bob as it's well below his maximum price of $15,000. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go lower than $13,000, as it's already closer to her desired price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will withdraw her offer completely, leaving Bob with the only option of buying from John at a higher price.

It's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product for a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
