"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $16,000 is closer, but I still need the price to come down a bit more for it to make sense for me. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
