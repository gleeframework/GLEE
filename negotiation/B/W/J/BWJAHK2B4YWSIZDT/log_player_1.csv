Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $16,000 is closer, but I still need the price to come down a bit more for it to make sense for me. How about $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been great to work with, and I think we're getting close. To seal the deal, how about we settle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are steadily hovering around a price point significantly lower than my minimum.  At this stage, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000, and continuing the negotiation risks leaving me with an even lower offer in later rounds. John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice now."
