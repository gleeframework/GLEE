"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000, a price that reflects its significant potential. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset worth over $1 million to you.  I understand you have other options, but I believe this is a deal that benefits us both.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit by starting with a high offer. 
* You know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high, potentially prompting her to make a lower counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Alice closer to a price that benefits you more.  There's a chance she'll come down in price to avoid losing the sale."
