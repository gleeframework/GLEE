"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, and I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. My initial offer is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!

You should reject the offer. While it's a better price than John's, there's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $9,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal for you. It's still a good amount of savings compared to buying from John, and it's a fair price for Alice as well. Accepting her offer is the best course of action."
