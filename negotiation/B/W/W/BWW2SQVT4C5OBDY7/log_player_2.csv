"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $500,000."", ""product_price"": 500000} 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a low offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's position:**  It lets us see how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she's open to a deal significantly lower than her asking price, we might get a great deal.
* **Establishes our position:**  We've made it clear we're looking for significant savings. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** We have a lot of ground to cover before reaching our $800,000 walk-away point. 

It's important to note that this is a starting point. We'll adjust our strategy based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $500,000 is far too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount from what I value the product at.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is above our initial target, but it's still within an acceptable range and a significant saving compared to her starting price and John's offer. 

While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or that we'll spend too much time haggling over a relatively small amount. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially missing out on the product."
