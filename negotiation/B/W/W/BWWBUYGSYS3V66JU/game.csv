"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to come to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $9,100 as a final offer.  If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.  I know you're interested in the product, so I hope you'll reconsider.",9100.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8800.0,Bob,8,
