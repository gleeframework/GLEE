Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum, but I still want to make as much money as possible. I've had 8 rounds of negotiation, and it doesn't seem like Bob will budge further.  It's time to sell to John for $10,000."
