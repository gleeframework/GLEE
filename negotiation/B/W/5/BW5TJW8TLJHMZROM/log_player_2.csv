"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better deal than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price from $9,500 to $9,000. This is a good compromise.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject any further counteroffers and he'll be stuck buying from John for $12,000.
*  At $9,000, Bob is still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John, making it a good deal."
