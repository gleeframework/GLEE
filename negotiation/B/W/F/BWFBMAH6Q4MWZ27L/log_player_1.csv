Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm confident that I can get at least $100 for it from John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $95 is still too low for me, as I can get $100 from John. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet in the middle and close the deal, as I'm still confident I can get $100 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired profit. I'm going to sell to John instead. I'm guaranteed $100 with John, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
