"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.
* There's no reason to immediately accept a price so far above my limit. 
* Rejecting allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
*  $8,000 is a reasonable starting point, given my budget of $10,000. 
* I'm hoping to secure a good deal without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay right now.
* I want to see if I can further negotiate and bring the price down closer to my $10,000 limit.
* Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm raising my offer slightly to $9,500, showing a willingness to compromise.
* This is still within my budget and is closer to Alice's last offer.
* Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  While $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to accept it.
* I'm only $1,000 away from my limit with John, and I believe there's still room for negotiation with Alice.
* Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm pushing my budget slightly to $10,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.
* This demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* I believe this counteroffer has a good chance of being accepted, as it's closer to Alice's last offer and only slightly above my limit. If Alice rejects it, I'll likely buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above my budget, and we're running out of rounds.
* With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of successfully negotiating a lower price are slim.
* It's more cost-effective to buy from John for $10,000, as I'm guaranteed a deal within my budget."
