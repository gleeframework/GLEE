"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I see you're being very aggressive with your counteroffers, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1800000, but I can do $1850000. What do you say?",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think you're trying to lowball me, Bob. I've been very flexible so far, but I'm not willing to go below $1800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $1775000. That's my final offer. What do you say?",1775000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made concessions, but you're not meeting me in the middle. I'm going to have to draw a line in the sand. I'll meet you at $1750000, but that's it. If you're not willing to pay that, I'm going to have to explore other options. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,9,
