"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This price still gives you a significant discount and leaves room for both of us to be happy.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
