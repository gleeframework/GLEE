Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it for $1,200,000 (John's price), aiming slightly lower increases the chance Bob accepts and we still secure a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong offer. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a potential gain if he believes he can leverage it further.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other buyers creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision to avoid missing out. 

**Important Note:** This assumes we want a quick sale. If time isn't a factor, we could start higher and negotiate down towards $1,200,000."
