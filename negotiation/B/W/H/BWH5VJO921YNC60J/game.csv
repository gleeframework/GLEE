"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while still staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to see a fair return on this valuable product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
