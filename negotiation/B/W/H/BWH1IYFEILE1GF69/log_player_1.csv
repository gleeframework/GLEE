"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's counteroffer and my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product has a high value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer guarantees I meet my minimum goal.  There's no point in risking a lower offer from Bob or taking the time to negotiate further when I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum."
