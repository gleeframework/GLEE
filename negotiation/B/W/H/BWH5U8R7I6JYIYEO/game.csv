"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still significantly below my initial valuation.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we discuss further?",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for both of us. Let's settle this right now: $1,600,000 and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, though...",1500000.0,Bob,6,
