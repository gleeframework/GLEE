"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get you on board, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I place on it while still leaving room for you to make a profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more in line with your offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which reflects the value I place on the product while also leaving room for you to make a profit. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is a compromise that reflects the value I place on the product, while also being closer to your offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
