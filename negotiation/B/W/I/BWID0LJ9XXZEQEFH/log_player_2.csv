"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $150. Would you be interested in making an offer closer to this amount? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's clear there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While it seems valuable, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm aiming for a price well below my $150 maximum, maximizing potential savings.
*  The message is polite and acknowledges the product's value while clearly stating my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering the product's value and market conditions, I would like to counter with a price of $120. I believe this strikes a good balance between value and affordability. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved down in price, $120 is still closer to my upper limit than her cost. There's room for her to reduce the price further, so I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly between our previous offers, signaling willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below Limit:** $110 keeps me well below my $150 maximum and leaves some wiggle room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Direct and Conciliatory:**  The message aims for a collaborative tone, suggesting a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering the product's unique features and your interest, I propose a price of $115. This offers a slight increase from your last offer while still maintaining a fair deal for both parties. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $115 is a reasonable price, saving me $35 off my maximum and only $35 above Alice's value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might save a few more dollars, but there's a chance the deal could fall through, forcing me to buy from John at $150. 
* **Time:**  We've already spent several rounds, and it's better to secure a good price now than risk running out of time."
