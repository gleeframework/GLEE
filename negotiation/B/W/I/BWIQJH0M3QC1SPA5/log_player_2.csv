"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a fair agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his maximum budget of $8,000 as possible.  He's offering $8,500 as a starting point, leaving some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's previous offer, but it is still a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob is willing to pay no more than $8,000 for the product and should continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering we're both looking to make a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his maximum budget and Alice's offer.  By offering $9,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise, while still keeping the price within his budget.  This should encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
