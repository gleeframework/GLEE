Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profits, but also avoid pushing Bob away completely.  $950,000 is a good starting point considering the product's value to him and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'm going to try and get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000, and it's a bit closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my last counteroffer, and it's a good deal for me. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure a sale and maximize my profit, rather than risking another round of negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
