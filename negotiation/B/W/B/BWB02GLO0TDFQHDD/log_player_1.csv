**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still in a good negotiating position. We're over halfway through the rounds, and he seems committed to purchasing.  We'll continue to counter in smaller increments to maintain pressure and aim for a higher final price."

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not increasing his offers significantly, indicating he's unlikely to reach our desired price point.  We've made substantial concessions, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of a smaller final offer or a failed deal altogether. At this point, it's strategically advantageous to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
