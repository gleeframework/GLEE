I'm going to sell the product to John.  Although I'm disappointed I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price than I'm comfortable with.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a good price considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000."
