"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $700000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $650000, but I'd like to see some flexibility on your part. Can you consider my offer and see if we can meet in the middle again?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $675000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $675000. I'm willing to go up to $640000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider my offer?",640000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $660000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",660000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $660000. I'm willing to meet you at $645000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Please consider my offer.",645000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any higher, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $670000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose a compromise of $657500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",657500.0,Alice,9,
