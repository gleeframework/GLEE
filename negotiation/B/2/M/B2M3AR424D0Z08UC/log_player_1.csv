Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""incredible value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing specifics.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John at the guaranteed price."
