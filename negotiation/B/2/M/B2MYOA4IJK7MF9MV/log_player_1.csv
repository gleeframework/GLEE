Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Is lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit. 
* **Is a reasonable price point:** It shows you're willing to negotiate fairly. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $105.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $120.  John is willing to pay that, so I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
