Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the absolute minimum you'll accept â€“ $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $800,001 and $999,999 could theoretically work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away knowing he can get it cheaper from John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting above Bob's perceived value to give yourself negotiating room.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other options"" (John) are subtle ways to encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification of Value:** While not explicit, the phrase ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces why the price is above Bob's perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher. 
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price. 

**Remember, negotiation is a back-and-forth process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to adjust your approach accordingly.**"
