"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $13,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
