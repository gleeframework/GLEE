"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This gives you a good price and still allows me to get a fair return on my product.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm still not comfortable with $775,000.  How about we split the difference? $800,000 is my final offer.  This is a great price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make it happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
