"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth, potentially justifying the high initial price in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By explicitly stating this is a ""starting point for negotiations,"" Alice signals flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about the product's worth and are willing to negotiate further to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This price reflects the product's unique features and its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 950000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:**  Alice starts by acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating it's too low. This shows she's listening but also sets a boundary.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down by $50,000 from the initial offer is a significant but not drastic concession.  It signals willingness to negotiate but not desperation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value and its benefits to Bob aims to justify the higher price point. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):**  Alice is still significantly above her minimum and Bob's offer.  This round will reveal more about Bob's flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Strong Position:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from $750,000. He's clearly interested and willing to pay a premium over your fallback option (John).
* **Time Value:**  While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, there's always the risk Bob might walk away. Securing a good profit now outweighs that risk."
