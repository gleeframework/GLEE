Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $11,000.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to go a little higher.  I'm also running out of time, but John is still an option if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try one last time to get closer to my target price.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal."
