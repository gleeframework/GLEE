Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  I need to make at least $12,000, so offering less than that is pointless.
* **Potential for Profit:** I'm hoping Bob values the product more than $12,000. A $2,000 markup is a reasonable starting point.  It's a decent profit margin without being excessively greedy. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so there's no downside to trying for a higher price."
