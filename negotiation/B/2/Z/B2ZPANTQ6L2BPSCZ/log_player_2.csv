# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is a discount, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John.  You can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
