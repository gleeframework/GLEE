"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1800000 is still a bit below my desired price point. Let's find a compromise.

"Bob, while I appreciate your continued interest and attempts to reach a compromise, $1750000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but we need to find a middle ground. Let's meet at $1850000.  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
