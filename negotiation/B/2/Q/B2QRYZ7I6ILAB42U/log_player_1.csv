Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a tremendous asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially.
* **Understand Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Offering it at that price would be a guaranteed sale but leaves a lot of money on the table.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents him from countering with a significantly lower offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high (avoiding potential pushback), but implies a ""unique value proposition"" to justify the cost.

**The offer of $1,400,000:**

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your guaranteed price.
* **Significantly higher than Bob's valuation:**  While a high price, it might entice Bob if he sees the value and is concerned about losing the opportunity. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of securing a sale with Bob."
