"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not exorbitantly so. This gives me room to negotiate while still being within a reasonable range.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to respond, encouraging him to counter-offer.

**Note:** I'm choosing to start the negotiation rather than letting Bob make the first move. This allows me to set the initial tone and frame the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is in the realm of what the product is worth to him, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob has acknowledged the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. This indicates that there's potential to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can set the terms of the next counter-offer. This gives me a better chance of securing a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:** I will use the next round to send a counter-offer that bridges the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counter-offer significantly increases Bob's initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line. 
* **Fairness Emphasized:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize the fairness of the proposed price.
* **Opportunity for Agreement:** By proposing a price point closer to Bob's, I'm increasing the chances of reaching a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a very good deal considering the limited rounds remaining.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's close to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate slightly higher. However, the risk of losing the deal to John or further haggling and potentially getting a lower offer makes this a good point to accept. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, it's crucial to make a decision that maximizes my profit while also mitigating the risk of losing the deal.

**Next Steps:** While accepting the offer, I might try to negotiate a small bonus or incentive for closing the deal quickly. However, I won't push too hard as I've secured a price close to my minimum and have limited time left."
