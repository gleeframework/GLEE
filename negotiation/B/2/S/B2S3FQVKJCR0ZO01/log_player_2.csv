"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's room to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum $1,500,000 limit.  Since you have more rounds to negotiate, it's worth rejecting and attempting to get a lower price. There's still room to bargain and potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
