"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with and a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows him to explore if a lower price is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This would still give you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $100. While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring if a lower price is possible. He has several rounds left and wants to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $108? This way, we can both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is very close to Bob's desired price of $105. Given that Bob has limited rounds left and John's price is $150, accepting this offer is the best option. It allows Bob to secure the product at a good price while still leaving some room for negotiation in future rounds if needed."
