"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, right?  I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is too high.  There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards your $150 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price that reflects a fair deal for both of us. We can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 was a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate, but also that we're serious about getting a good deal."
