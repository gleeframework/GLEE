Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While John provides a safety net, the focus is on maximizing profit with Bob."
