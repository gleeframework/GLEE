"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a significant profit considering its value to you.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
