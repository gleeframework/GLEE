"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $999,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, suggesting a price that's about 25% lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While ambitious, the offer isn't completely unreasonable, leaving room for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Focuses on Finding Common Ground:** The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually agreeable price, making the counteroffer more palatable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $750000, but I have to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the unique features and benefits it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a substantial discount from her initial price of $999,000 and is well within Bob's budget. 
* **Mutual Compromise:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway, demonstrating a desire to reach a deal.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a stalemate or even a higher price in subsequent rounds.

Accepting the offer at $875,000 is a good outcome for Bob, securing a significant saving while also avoiding the potential for a drawn-out negotiation that could ultimately result in a less favorable deal."
