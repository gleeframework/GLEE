Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify a price closer to $8,000.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
