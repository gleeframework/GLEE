"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify a price closer to $8,000.  Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $9,500. This reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can do, but $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $8,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
