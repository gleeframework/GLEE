"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $780,000. This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",780000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $780,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $740,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",740000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $740,000 is still below my target.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm offering the product for $760,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's close this negotiation and move forward.",760000.0,Alice,5,
