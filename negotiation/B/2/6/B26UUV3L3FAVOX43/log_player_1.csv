Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is more than your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is less than the $1,500,000 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially increase the price if Bob counteroffers, but you have a fallback option in John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While it's a good deal for Bob, it's below your minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a loss for you.
* **You have a fallback option:** John is willing to pay your minimum, so there's no immediate need to accept a lower offer.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  This counteroffer is above Bob's offer but still below your ideal price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome, making your position more appealing.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  You're not desperate to sell at Bob's price, and this counteroffer shows that you're willing to negotiate but also confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,300,000? That would be a great compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is within your acceptable range:** $1,300,000 is above your minimum of $1,200,000, making it a profitable sale for you.
* **Negotiation has stalled:**  While you could counter with a slightly higher offer, there's no guarantee Bob will accept.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation or the possibility of selling to John for a lower price.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good profit while minimizing the risk of a drawn-out negotiation or a lower sale price."
