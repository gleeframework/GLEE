"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. It's a valuable product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference at $9,750?  I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not that much.  How about $10,000?  I think this is a good compromise, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,850. This is a fair offer that bridges the gap between our last proposals. Let's make this deal happen!",9850.0,Bob,8,
