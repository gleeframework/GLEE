Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By mentioning a ""strong offer lined up,"" we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number. It highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price point.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
