"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price. You can try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product has value, making it less likely for Alice to immediately reject your offer.  You're also close to your maximum price with John, so you have some room to manoeuvre."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than what you can get from John, but it's close enough that it's worth accepting. You can try to negotiate further, but it's risky. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept your next counteroffer, and you might end up paying more than $9,000. It's better to secure the product for $9,000 now and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation."
