"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's input, creating a more collaborative tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I know I have John as a backup option. This knowledge gives me the confidence to start strong with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is significantly lower than my minimum. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but not Drastic Reduction:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, signaling flexibility but not desperation. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to counter Bob's lower assessment.  This is crucial to avoid getting anchored to his initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:**  I'm projecting confidence in the product's worth, which can subtly influence Bob's perception and willingness to negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, signaling a willingness to compromise. However, it's still $100,000 below my guaranteed sale price with John.  I'll push a bit further in the next round to see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Your willingness to compromise is appreciated. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This represents a significant movement on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm coming down significantly, almost meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. This shows strong commitment to closing the deal.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win to encourage Bob's acceptance. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still comfortably above my guaranteed sale price with John, preserving my leverage while enticing Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching My Safety Net:** Bob's offer now matches the amount John is willing to pay. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, suggesting he's unlikely to move higher.
* **Time Value and Risk:** Continuing negotiations has risks. Bob could walk away, or further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids potential delays."
