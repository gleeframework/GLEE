"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Your willingness to compromise is appreciated. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This represents a significant movement on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
