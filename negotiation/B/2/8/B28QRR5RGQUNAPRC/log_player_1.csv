Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the benefits it offers you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as ""fair"" by emphasizing the ""benefits"" to Bob.

This strategy aims for the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
