"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the proposed price is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe this offer reflects a fair price considering market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm motivated to find a fair deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly below both the product's value to us ($800,000) and Bob's own valuation. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Aiming High, Staying Realistic:** We started high at $1,200,000 to gauge Bob's willingness.  Coming down to $950,000 shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Middle Ground Encourages Agreement:**  Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both sides, hopefully encouraging Bob to counter closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I'm trying to find a price point that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Our Minimum:** While Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range, $700,000 is still below our minimum of $800,000.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** We have John as a backup buyer, which provides us with leverage. Bob's counteroffers indicate strong interest, suggesting he might be willing to go higher. 
* **Time for a Strategic Counter:** Rejecting gives us a chance to make a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving, but pushes closer to our target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $875,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers and keeps it a win-win for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm, Showing Flexibility:** We're holding closer to our minimum ($800,000) while still demonstrating some movement from our previous counteroffer.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.  This is especially important as Bob seems price-sensitive.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer will reveal how much further Bob is willing to go and if a deal within our desired range is realistic."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to offer $780,000 for the product.  I believe this is a very competitive offer and demonstrates my strong interest in making this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Unlikely to Reach $800,000:** Bob's offer of $780,000 is very close to our minimum, but his incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to hit our $800,000 target.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** We have a guaranteed buyer in John at $800,000. There's no risk of losing the sale or engaging in further drawn-out negotiations.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now with John gives us immediate access to the funds, rather than risking further negotiation rounds with Bob for a marginal gain."
