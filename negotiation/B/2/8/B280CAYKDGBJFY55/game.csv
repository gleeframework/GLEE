"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $150 for the product.  This is my final offer - let me know if you'll accept it.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $165, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",165.0,Alice,5,
