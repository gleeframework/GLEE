"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You're willing to pay $150, and Alice is offering the product at $150.  You can get the same product from John for the same price, so there's no advantage to buying from Alice."
