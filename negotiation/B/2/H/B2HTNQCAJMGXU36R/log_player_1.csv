"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum price of $12,000 and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob. I'm aiming for a middle ground that might entice him while remaining above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, especially when I have the option to sell to John for $12,000.  I'll counteroffer again, hopefully finding a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to my minimum acceptable amount of $12,000. I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value of my product and be willing to pay this price. If he rejects, I'll still have the option to sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay anywhere near my minimum price. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $12,000. This ensures I get at least my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob that may be fruitless."
