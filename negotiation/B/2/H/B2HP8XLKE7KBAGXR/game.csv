"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
