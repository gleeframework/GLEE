,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm confident this product can significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I can offer it for $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential value this product offers me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
