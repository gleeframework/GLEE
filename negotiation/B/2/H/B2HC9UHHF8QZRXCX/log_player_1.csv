"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, as it's still less than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I need to hold out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a significant profit for me. I believe it's a fair price that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, although it's getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can secure a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

I'm offering $1,090,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still making a good profit and I'm confident Bob will be more willing to accept this offer given that we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is getting very close to my desired price.  We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  This is a good profit, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the sale."
