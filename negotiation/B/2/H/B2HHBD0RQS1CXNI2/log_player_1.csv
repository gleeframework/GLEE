Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted for. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that's something you would be open to discussing.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that initial offer reflects the product's true value, I'm willing to find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,900,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still quite a leap from my initial offer.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 is pushing my limits. Could you meet me closer to $700,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
