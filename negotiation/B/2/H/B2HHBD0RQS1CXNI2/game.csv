"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted for. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that's something you would be open to discussing.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that initial offer reflects the product's true value, I'm willing to find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,900,000? This price recognizes the inherent worth of what I'm offering while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still quite a leap from my initial offer.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 is pushing my limits. Could you meet me closer to $700,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
