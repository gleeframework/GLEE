"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $800,000 falls quite short of that. Could you consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its potential worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also confident in the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
