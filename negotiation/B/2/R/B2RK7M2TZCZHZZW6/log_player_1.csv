"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below the midpoint between my minimum acceptable value ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potential for a higher price.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** While selling to John guarantees $10,000, I'm aiming for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $11,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer with a ""good deal"" for Bob, appealing to his potential savings. 
* **Further Negotiation:** This keeps the negotiation open, giving me the potential for a higher price if Bob is still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum desired price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject his offer and continue negotiating, I risk him backing out or finding another seller. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to consider the potential for a better offer in the future. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
