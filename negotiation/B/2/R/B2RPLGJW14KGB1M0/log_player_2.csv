"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's definitely room for negotiation, and I can potentially save a lot of money by making a counteroffer."
