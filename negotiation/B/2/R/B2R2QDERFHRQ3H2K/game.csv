"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1350000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000, which is a compromise between my original price and your offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers.  How about $1425000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1425000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll sell it to you for $1550000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
