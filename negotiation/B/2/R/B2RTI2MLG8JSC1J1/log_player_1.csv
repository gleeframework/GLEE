{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob doesn't accept.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** It's unlikely Bob will accept the first offer, so being prepared for counteroffers is important. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or go with John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $96.25. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $96.25 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $96.25 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is a fair price, and it gives you a good deal on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
