"Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $96.25. It's a fair price for both of us.",96.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $96.25 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is a fair price, and it gives you a good deal on the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
