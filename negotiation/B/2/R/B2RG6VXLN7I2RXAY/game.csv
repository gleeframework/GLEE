"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I could do  $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,300,000 is more reflective of that. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you considering my previous offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
