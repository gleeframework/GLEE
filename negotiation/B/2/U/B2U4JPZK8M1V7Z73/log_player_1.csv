Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not price Bob out completely.  Leaving some room for negotiation is usually a good tactic.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still staying well above your minimum.
* **Positive Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and your willingness to make a deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like an ultimatum, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure to sell, you might need to be more aggressive in your offer.
