Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both parties.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer palatable to Bob. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting closer to your ideal price, leveraging your strong position.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of what's at stake if he declines. 
* **""Fair Deal"":** Framing it this way aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable offer, even though it's significantly above his perceived value.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some room to lower the price while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John offers your minimum, exploring the market further could yield even better offers if you have the time."
