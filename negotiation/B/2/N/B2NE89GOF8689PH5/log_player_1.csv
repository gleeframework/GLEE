Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects or counters. You can always adjust your price closer to $10,000 if needed, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
