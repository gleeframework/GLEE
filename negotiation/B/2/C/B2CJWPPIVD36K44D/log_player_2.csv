Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.
