"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, the value of this product is significant, and $11,000 is below its worth. I could consider letting it go for $12,250. This feels like a fair compromise.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,250.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,625? It's a fair compromise that's closer to what I can afford right now.",11625.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both feel good about. How about we settle at $11,950? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",11950.0,Alice,5,
