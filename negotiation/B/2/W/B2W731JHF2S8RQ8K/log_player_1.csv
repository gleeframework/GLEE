Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob values the product much higher. Aiming closer to his valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant gain for you.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in the offered price, making it more persuasive. 

This strategy balances securing a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting the guaranteed sale to John."
