"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage Bob to negotiate, but I'm still in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject it and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000.  This is still a good profit margin for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject it and send a counteroffer in the next round. I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $12,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,500. This is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hopeful that Bob will come up a little higher.  If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking a deal completely. John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell to John."
