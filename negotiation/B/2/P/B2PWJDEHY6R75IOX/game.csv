"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  $200 is a bit steep for me, how about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $125. I'll sell it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  While $175 is closer, I'm hoping to spend closer to $140 for it.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $155 is my absolute minimum. It's still a great price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll be happy with it.",155.0,Alice,5,
