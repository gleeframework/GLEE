Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident this product is worth that to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $88. I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $88 is still a decent profit and I'm worried about losing the deal completely if I keep pushing for a higher price."
