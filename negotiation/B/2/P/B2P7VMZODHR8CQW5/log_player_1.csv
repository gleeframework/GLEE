Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider this price, and it gives me some wiggle room to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's worth to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal. While I'd prefer more, I'd rather sell to Bob than go through further negotiations or sell to John for $150."
