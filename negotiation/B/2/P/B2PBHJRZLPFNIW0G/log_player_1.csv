Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price going up to $10,500. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge past $9,500. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, it's more profitable to take the sure thing.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a better outcome."
