# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Reasoning:** Alice is offering the product for $14,000. While this is a discount from her initial asking price, you know you can get it for $15,000 from John. There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
