"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount for Bob, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit well above my minimum threshold.  I'm aiming to secure a deal as quickly as possible, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,380,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum threshold.  I believe this price is fair, given Bob's willingness to negotiate and my need to maximize my profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,320,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to secure a better price in the next round. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $1,350,000. This price is a good compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him and it allows me to avoid further negotiation and risk losing time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,290,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. It's getting a little risky, as I only have four rounds left before I'm forced to sell to John. However, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. Time is running out, and I need to secure a sale. While I was hoping to get closer to my target price, Bob seems unwilling to budge. It's better to guarantee a sale now than risk losing the deal completely."
