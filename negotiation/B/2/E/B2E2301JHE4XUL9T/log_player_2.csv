"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is starting higher than her product's worth to her ($12,000). By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to make a lower counter-offer."
