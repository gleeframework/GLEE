"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $15000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  $12000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me, given the product's unique value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $17000. Let's find some common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit far off. I'm willing to pay up to $14000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $14000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15500?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $13000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,6,
