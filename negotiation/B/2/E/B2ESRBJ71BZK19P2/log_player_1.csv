"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave some room for negotiation. It's important to be confident and assertive in the initial offer, but also be open to some compromise later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only pay $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to counteroffer, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and the time constraint of only 10 rounds make accepting his offer the best strategy."
