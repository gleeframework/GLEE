"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering it's still a good deal for you, and it's within my price range. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a bit more reasonable for me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll find hard to refuse. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to making a deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,
