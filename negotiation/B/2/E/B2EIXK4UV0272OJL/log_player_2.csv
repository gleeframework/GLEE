Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a bit more reasonable for me. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still above your budget of $10,000. It's better to buy the product from John for $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and stay within your budget."
