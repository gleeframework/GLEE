"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a possibility that Alice will lower her price, or Bob can secure a better deal with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's budget. While it's closer, it's worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, or Bob can still secure a deal with John for $1,000,000."
