"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to try to get her lower with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $9,500 is a good compromise point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, and we only have 5 rounds left. It's getting risky to keep rejecting, as I might not get a better offer.  $10,500 is a good deal compared to the $10,000 I would pay John."
