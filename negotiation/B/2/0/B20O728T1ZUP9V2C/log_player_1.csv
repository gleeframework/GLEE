Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with an offer close to your minimum ($150) but still potentially appealing to Bob is the best strategy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for him to counter-offer if he's truly interested. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're guaranteed to sell it to John for your minimum price."
