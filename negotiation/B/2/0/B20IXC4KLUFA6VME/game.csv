"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $780000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $795000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",795000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $795000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll find it reasonable.",815000.0,Alice,5,
