Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,750,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my value for this product.  I'll counter with a price closer to what I need."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident that I can either get closer to my desired price with Bob or secure the $1,500,000 from John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on my budget considerations, I would like to counteroffer at $1,325,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

While $1,325,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can either get closer to my desired price with Bob or secure the $1,500,000 from John.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  $1,325,000 is a good offer, but I'm only willing to go down to $1,340,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is getting closer, we are running out of time. I'm not sure if I can get him to come up further in price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer. John is a sure thing at $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
