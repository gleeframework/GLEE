"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. My starting price is $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I can't go that low. How about $1,300,000? This price still allows for a substantial profit for you and gives us a good starting point for the remaining rounds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still not a price that works for me. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a decent profit. Let's close the deal in the next few rounds.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a good compromise for both of us and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
