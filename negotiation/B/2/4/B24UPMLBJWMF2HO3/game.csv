"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product is $15,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,500. This reflects the value of the product and the potential we both see in it. Let's make this deal work!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000.

"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $15,500. This way, we both get a good deal, and we can finalize this sale. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,
