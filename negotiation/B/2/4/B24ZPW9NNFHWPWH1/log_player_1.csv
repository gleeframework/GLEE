Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher price ($1,900,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above your minimum.
* **Value emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob reinforces its worth and justifies the high price.
* **Urgency and scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **John as a safety net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can negotiate down knowing you have a backup plan.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's valuation and your fallback option."
