"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating that the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Target in Mind:**  While my maximum is $10,000, aiming lower initially increases the chances of getting a price closer to my ideal outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to my range, $11,000 is still above my ideal price and my fallback option (John's offer). 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting this offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. She might be willing to come down further."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is the very highest I can go.  If you're willing to make that work, I'm ready to buy today."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I've reached my absolute limit. It's important to be clear and firm about this. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By indicating I'm ready to buy ""today,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure for Alice to make a decision.
* **Alternative:** Alice knows I have the option of buying from John, so she risks losing the sale entirely if she rejects this offer."
