Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is quite low, I understand your perspective on the value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the significant value this product brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aware of the value of the product (worth $1,200,000 to him). We're still early in the negotiation, and accepting his offer now would leave a lot of potential profit on the table. I'm betting I can negotiate him up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and that's great.  $1,000,000 is a bit too close to my minimum though.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,075,000 and we close this out?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a maximum of $1,050,000. Let me know if that works for you and we can get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting close to his maximum price, and we're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting $1,050,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
