"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll try to counter with a price that's more appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm going to offer $140. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's closer to Bob's valuation, making it more likely he'll accept.  If he still rejects, I might consider selling to John, but I'm hoping we can close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm still not at my minimum. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to offer $130. This is a small reduction from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to sway Bob.  If he still rejects, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum, and I'm worried if I keep rejecting, I'll end up with less than I want. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
