"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. I believe it's a great value for its unique features. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.  There's no harm in seeing if I can negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject the initial offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in this product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to comfortably move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good compromise. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, and it's within my budget.  Accepting this offer allows me to get the product for a good price without further negotiation and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer."
