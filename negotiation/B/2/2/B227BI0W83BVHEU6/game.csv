"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in this product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to comfortably move forward with the purchase.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's find a middle ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
