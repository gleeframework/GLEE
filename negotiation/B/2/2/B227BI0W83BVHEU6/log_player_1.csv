"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. I believe it's a great value for its unique features. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's features and potential benefits to Bob might pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in this product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to comfortably move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price than $12,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge his true willingness to pay and understand his negotiation style."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from the previous round. 
* **Fairness:**  $13,500 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a potential middle ground.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum, maintaining some bargaining power.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""good deal"" reinforces a win-win scenario for both of us."
