"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value justifies a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. Can we discuss some concessions or other terms that might make this deal work for both of us?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is close, but to make this work for me, I need to be at $925,000.  If that's not possible, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already met you at $950,000 and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a comprehensive support package and a 6-month warranty, which is a $50,000 value. That brings the total value to $1,000,000, which is the price I was initially looking for. Would you be interested in taking the product at $950,000 with these extras?",950000.0,Alice,7,
