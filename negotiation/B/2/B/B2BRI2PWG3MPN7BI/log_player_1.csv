Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The **message** is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer** - this allows for a more engaging negotiation and potentially a better outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his price point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a compromise that works for both of us.  Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,800 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,200? I believe this price reflects the product's value while allowing you to stay within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,200, which is exactly in the middle between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's latest offer of $8,800.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the ""split the difference"" approach to suggest a fair compromise.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a bit of urgency by saying ""Let's make this deal happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,800. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is finally within my acceptable range. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
