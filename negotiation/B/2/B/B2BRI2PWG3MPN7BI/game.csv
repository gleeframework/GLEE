"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,800 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,200? I believe this price reflects the product's value while allowing you to stay within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,800. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? That's the highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,6,
