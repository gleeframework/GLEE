Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is closer to my ideal price point. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Value Proposition:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to see it as worth the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I phrase it in a way that leaves the door open for counteroffers and further discussion.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Remember, John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail, guaranteeing me at least $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. While $8,500 is better than $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions, aiming to secure a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price that's more acceptable to me. I need to consider:
* How much I'm willing to budge from my initial offer.
* Bob's willingness to pay and potential to go higher.
* The possibility of selling to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and shows I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize finding a ""good deal"" to appeal to Bob's desire for value. 
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm not rejecting Bob's offer outright. This keeps the negotiation going and leaves room for further compromise.

**Analysis:**

* **Bob's perspective:**  $9,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay $12,000. 
* **My perspective:** This price is closer to my desired outcome than $8,500, but it's still significantly lower than my ideal price of $10,000. 

**Next Steps:** I'm ready to either accept Bob's offer if he agrees or make a final counteroffer if he doesn't. I need to evaluate:
* How likely Bob is to accept my counteroffer.
* The risk of losing the sale if I push too hard for a higher price.
* My willingness to settle for $9,250 or risk selling to John for $8,000."
