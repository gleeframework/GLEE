Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what it's worth to me. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It's important to be persuasive but also open to negotiation.

This offer allows for potential negotiation while still keeping a good margin for myself. If Bob rejects the offer, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or go with John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to aim for a higher price to maximize my profits. I'll use this round to try and find a compromise that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This is a compromise offer.  It's higher than Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my minimum price. It signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly but firm. It emphasizes the value of the product and presents a compromise that benefits both parties.

This counteroffer is a strategic move. I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum, while also keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $10,000, which is closer to my preferred price point. While I would like more, it's not a huge difference, and I'm happy to secure a sale at this price. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob completely and having to settle for John's offer of $15,000. 

This is a good balance of maximizing my profit while also ensuring a sale."
