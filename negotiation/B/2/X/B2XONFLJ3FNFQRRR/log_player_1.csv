I'm starting with my ideal price. This way, I leave room for negotiation while still ensuring I get the minimum value I need. If Bob rejects, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price without risking losing out to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still aiming for a value closer to what I need. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."

Bob's offer is now at the value he's willing to pay, which is still a good deal for me.  Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, I'm happy to accept this offer."
