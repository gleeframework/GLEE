"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $9,000
* **Your Maximum:** $10,000
* **John's Price:** $10,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, it's likely she won't go lower than her own value of $8,000."
