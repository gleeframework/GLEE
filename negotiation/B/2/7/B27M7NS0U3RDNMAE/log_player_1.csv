Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you're significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of selling to John for $8,000 if needed."
