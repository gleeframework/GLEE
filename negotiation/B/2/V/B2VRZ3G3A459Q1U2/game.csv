"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the information about the product. While I believe it's a good product, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. That said, $900,000 is still a bit further than I'm comfortable going. I could potentially stretch my budget to $750,000.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
