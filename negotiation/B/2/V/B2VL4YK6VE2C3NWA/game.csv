"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you think $75 is a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but that's as low as I can go.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $78? That's the absolute best I can do.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $82, but that's the final offer. I've already given you a good deal, and I need to make a profit.",82.0,Alice,7,
