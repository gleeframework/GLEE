"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but you can do better.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffering allows you to potentially save money.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
