"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This still leaves room for you to benefit significantly from the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can meet at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
