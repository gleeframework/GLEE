"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $90. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which is $165. How about we try $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
