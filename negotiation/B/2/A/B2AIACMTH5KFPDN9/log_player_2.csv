"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to accept a lower counteroffer to avoid losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, while still being within his budget. A counteroffer of $13,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might be attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try for a lower price.  There's still a chance Alice might be willing to come down further to avoid losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, but still within his budget. A counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now equal to the price John is offering.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, and there's no indication Alice will lower her price further, it's best for Bob to accept John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice as the price is the same as John's."
