Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This ensures you don't lose money if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob understands exactly what you're offering.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, you can go back to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
