{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I will reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm offering $90, which is still within my budget and hopefully a fair price for Alice."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still asking too much. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $100. I've already negotiated for a few rounds, and it doesn't seem like Alice is willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with."
