"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Fairly high:** It's closer to the product's value to Bob, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Not too aggressive:** It still leaves room for you to make a profit and avoid an immediate rejection. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is above your minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves you with a lower profit margin.  You want to try and get closer to your desired price, so it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $110 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This approach shows that you're willing to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Remaining above your minimum:** $125 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring you make a profit. 

Let's see if this counteroffer works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 is a bit low, Alice. How about we settle at $118? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $118 isn't ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. Considering we're already in round 4, it's a good idea to accept this offer and avoid risking further negotiation with Bob.  The risk of going back and forth is that Bob might get frustrated and walk away, or I might end up having to sell to John at a lower price."
