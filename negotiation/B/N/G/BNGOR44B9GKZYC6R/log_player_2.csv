You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also signals that I'm not afraid to walk away. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now willing to negotiate, and her offer is getting closer to my ideal price. However, I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her to agree to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  Hopefully, this is a sweet spot that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would love to get the price down to $820,000, Alice has shown a willingness to come down but is clearly holding firm at a price point above that. Given that I only have 5 rounds left, and buying from John would cost me $175,000 more, it's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
