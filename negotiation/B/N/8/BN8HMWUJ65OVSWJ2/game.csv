"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product looks great, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $95 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm firm on $85. Let's close this deal.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $95, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in a bonus feature that's worth $5 to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the bonus feature,  $90 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",85.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $90, Bob. I've already thrown in a bonus feature worth $5. If you're not willing to meet me at $90, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'll sell the product to you for $92. This is my final offer.",92.0,Alice,9,
