"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to buy immediately. By rejecting, we can see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $2,000 drop is substantial, but still within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation.  We want to see if we can get closer to our desired price before accepting.  Rejecting allows us to continue exploring lower options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice we're serious about buying. This middle ground approach aims to find a compromise while keeping our budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000.  This is a good price for us, as it's within our budget and significantly lower than John's price. While we could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject our counteroffer and we could end up paying more in the next rounds. It's better to secure this deal and save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
