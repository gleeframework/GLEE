"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product further. While it's valuable to me, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me and your potential for a quick sale. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you and the potential for a quick sale, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me.",875000.0,Alice,3,
