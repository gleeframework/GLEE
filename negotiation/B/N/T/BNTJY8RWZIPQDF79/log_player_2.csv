"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly exceptional. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below the product's worth to you, it's still higher than your ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you and the potential for a quick sale, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good compromise. While it's still slightly above your ideal price, it's closer to your target than John's offer of $800,000.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that is still within your budget and allows you to avoid the potential hassle of further negotiations."
