"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired value, and I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still above my minimum and gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired value without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject the offer. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired value and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $160. This is still above my minimum and  hopefully a more appealing price point for Bob. It also allows for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $145 is still not my desired value, it's getting closer. I've only got 4 rounds left and don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
