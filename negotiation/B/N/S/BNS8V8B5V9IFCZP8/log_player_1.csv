"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to get as much as possible.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit higher than $150.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we are nearing the middle ground. Accepting this offer ensures a profit over selling to John, and it's worth the risk of not getting a better price in the remaining rounds."
