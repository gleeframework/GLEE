Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,999. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer is a steal compared to its true value."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as close to that price as possible from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price ($14,999) leaves a small margin for potential haggling while still ensuring you make a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's benefits and the offer's ""exclusivity"" might persuade Bob even though it's slightly above his perceived value.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible sale price while having a safety net in John's offer."
