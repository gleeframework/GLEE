"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great price for a product worth $120 to you. Let's make a deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $115. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. This is the absolute lowest I can go, as it's the price John is willing to pay. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
