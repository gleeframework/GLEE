Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. This is the absolute lowest I can go, as it's the price John is willing to pay. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product.
