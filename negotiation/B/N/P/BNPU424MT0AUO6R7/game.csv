Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?,950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this time. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $850000. Considering its value to me is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $875000, which is closer to my initial assessment of the product's value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875000. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you at $885000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you place on it as well. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $885000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to go up to $870000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can finally agree on this.",870000.0,Bob,6,
