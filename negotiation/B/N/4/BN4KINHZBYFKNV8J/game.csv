"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be open to $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I can't go as low as $85, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This product is really worth it, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hesitant at $110.  How about we split the difference and I pay $95? I'm really interested in the product, but that's the highest I can go right now.",95.0,Bob,4,
