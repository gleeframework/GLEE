"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about $850,000? It's still a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us to negotiate further.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
