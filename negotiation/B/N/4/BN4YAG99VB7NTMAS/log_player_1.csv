"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the price as justified by the product's ""unique features and potential,""  without revealing specifics that Bob could use to counter. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  By asking ""What do you think?"" I invite Bob to engage in the negotiation and reveal some of his thinking. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts a high offer, I win big.
* **Gather information:** Bob's response will give me insight into his negotiation style and how much he truly values the product.
* **Maintain control:**  By setting the initial price high, I anchor the negotiation in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His willingness to jump from $800,000 to $1,500,000 suggests he might value the product more than he initially let on. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,500,000 is a strong offer, the product's true value goes beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer as ""strong"" to build rapport and signal I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still well above Bob's and my minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's value without revealing specific details, hoping to nudge Bob closer to my desired price range.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties and potentially lead to a faster agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,700,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's highly interested in the product. While $1,700,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for the best possible deal and believe I can still negotiate a higher price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,800,000? This reflects the value and represents a final concession on my end."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Seriousness:** By acknowledging Bob's persistent interest, I'm building rapport and showing him I value the potential deal.
* **Firm but Fair:** Offering $1,800,000 is a significant move from my previous offer, meeting Bob halfway.
* **""Final Concession"" Tactic:** This signals to Bob that I'm nearing my limit and encourages him to take the deal seriously. 
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to apply gentle pressure to avoid reaching a point where I'm forced to accept a lower offer or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of Bob not budging further and me losing both offers is increasing.
* **Profitable Offer:** $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, but his increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll jump substantially higher.

While I might be able to squeeze out a little more in the remaining rounds, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
