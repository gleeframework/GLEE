"Alice, your offer is enticing but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'd like to offer $750,000 for the product.  This reflects my current needs and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about $800,000?  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still recognizing the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
