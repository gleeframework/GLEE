"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's closer to what I'm looking for.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
