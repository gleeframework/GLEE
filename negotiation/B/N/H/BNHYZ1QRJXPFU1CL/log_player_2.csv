You can do better than $1,100,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice is still too high, but we're getting closer. Let's try a counteroffer to see if we can get her down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

At this point, it's likely that Alice is holding firm on her price.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a good chance she won't budge further.  Accepting her offer at $1,020,000 saves us $180,000 compared to buying from John."
