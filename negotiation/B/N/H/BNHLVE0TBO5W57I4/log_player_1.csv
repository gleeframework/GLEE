Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $97.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's getting late in the negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $100 to avoid the risk of Bob continuing to low-ball me."
