"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $7,000, we're starting significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to Alice's value ($8,000) than our maximum price ($10,000), potentially giving us an advantage.
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves space for Alice to counteroffer, and for us to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice moved closer to the middle ground, $8,500 is still above her value for the product. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Leverage:**  We haven't reached our maximum price yet and Alice is likely motivated to sell.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings by negotiating further outweigh the risk of Alice walking away, as we have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about we settle at $8,000? That seems like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We're now offering exactly what the product is worth to Alice. 
* **Pressure Point:** This puts a bit of pressure on Alice, as she knows we have the option to go to John if she refuses. 
* **Potential for Success:** There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, as it allows her to sell the product at her desired value."
