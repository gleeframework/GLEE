"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $14000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be able to pay a maximum of $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
