Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the inherent worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
