"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your target price. There's potential to negotiate further and secure a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a fair compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and only slightly higher than your counteroffer. Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product for less than what you'd pay John, achieving your goal of saving money."
