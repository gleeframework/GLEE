Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $22,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's settle this right now - how about $15,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her final offer of $15,000 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000.  I'm not willing to risk going any further with Alice, as I'm concerned she won't come down any further. It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000."
