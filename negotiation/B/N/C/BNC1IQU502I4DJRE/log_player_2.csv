Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and counter-offer with a much lower amount to start negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $14,000?

While Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price range, $14,000 is still above what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further down before considering Alice's offer or going with John."

Alice's offer:

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but there's still a chance to save a little more. It's worth one more counter-offer slightly above John's price to see if Alice will budge."

Alice's offer:

It seems like Alice won't go below $12,500. While you could try to haggle further, it's unlikely you'll get a better deal than John's $12,000 offer at this point. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed savings."
