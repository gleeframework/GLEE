"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $700,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to get it for a lower price to make it work for my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,3,
