"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Considering its value to you, we're offering it for $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product worth more than $8,000 to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value this product brings, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure both parties benefit, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This still allows us to reach a fair agreement while keeping the transaction beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to your budget, it's still slightly over your preferred price point.  You have a few options:

* **Negotiate further:** You can try to get Alice down a bit more with a counteroffer.
* **Buy from John:**  If you're not confident you can get a better price from Alice, John's offer provides a guaranteed solution within your budget. 

Since you're aiming for the lowest possible price, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  If it doesn't work out, you can always fall back on John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair amount for me and would still provide a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to move forward, I propose a final price of $9,300 for the product. This price reflects the value you place on it while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,300 is still above your ideal price point.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a risk that you might go back and forth with Alice indefinitely without reaching a mutually agreeable price.

At this point, it's more practical to take the guaranteed offer from John at $8,000. You'll save $1,300 compared to Alice's final offer and achieve your goal of buying the product within your budget."
