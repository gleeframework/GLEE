{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it's worth $140. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above your minimum but below what the product is worth to Bob. This should encourage him to negotiate but also leaves room for you to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $130 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer. Rejecting his offer allows you to potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to pay $135 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to propose $130 as the price for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come back to his previous offer of $130.  While this is not ideal, it is still above your minimum and it's possible he won't budge further. It's better to accept and secure the sale than risk losing him completely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
