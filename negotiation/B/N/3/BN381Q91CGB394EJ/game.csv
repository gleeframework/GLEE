"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is set at $12,000.  Is there any wiggle room at all for you to meet me there? ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already come down from $18,000 to $16,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
