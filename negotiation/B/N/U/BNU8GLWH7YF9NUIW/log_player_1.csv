``` 
 
This is a starting point. It's a good idea to start with a price that is closer to your minimum value but also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust the price down slightly in your counteroffer, depending on how determined you are to sell to Bob rather than John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $85. Can you meet me halfway and consider $87.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is quite close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to settle for John's offer.  I'll accept his offer and sell for $87.50."
