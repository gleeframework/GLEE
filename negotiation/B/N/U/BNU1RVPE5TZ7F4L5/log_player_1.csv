"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
 ""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer serves as a gauge of Bob's eagerness and sets the tone for the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net and allows me to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000, and I'm willing to counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This product offers significant value, and I believe that's a fair reflection. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility while still holding firm on a price above Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to support my counteroffer.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Proposing $875,000 as a middle ground aims to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm keeping John's $800,000 offer in mind as a potential alternative if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to compromise and meet you in the middle at $862,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $862,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than my guaranteed offer from John ($800,000), and Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in further rounds."
