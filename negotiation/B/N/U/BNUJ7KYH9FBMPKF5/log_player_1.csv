Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price to John, but it gives me a chance to maximize my profit.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential Upside:** I'm hoping Bob values the product at more than $2,000,000. If he does, I'll get a better price than selling to John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Even if Bob rejects, I still get my minimum acceptable price from John. 

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to secure a sale."
