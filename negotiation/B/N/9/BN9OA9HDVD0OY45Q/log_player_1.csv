Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree the product has potential, $1,400,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider  $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
