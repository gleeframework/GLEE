Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal target.  There's still room for further negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, as it's my minimum requirement. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire the product at a fair price, considering its value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $1,200,000. This is a good price for you, as it's significantly lower than what John is selling the product for.  While you could potentially continue to negotiate, the chances of Alice going lower are slim, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to pay John's higher price."
