"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1150000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, as it's my minimum requirement. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire the product at a fair price, considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
