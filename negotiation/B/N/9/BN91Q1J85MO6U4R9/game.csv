"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. $10,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",10600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,600 and $10,800, so I can offer the product to you for $10,700. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,7,
