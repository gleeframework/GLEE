"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $11,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a decent price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's room to push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, Bob is still within reach of his goal of getting the product for less than $10,000. By rejecting this offer, he can attempt to push Alice even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. $10,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,600 and $10,800, so I can offer the product to you for $10,700. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,700 is a good deal, Bob has reached a point where he's only saving $100 by continuing to negotiate with Alice. The risk of Alice refusing his next counteroffer and potentially increasing the price is too high. It's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from John at his target price of $10,000."
