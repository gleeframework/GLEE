"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far too high for Bob's budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as Bob can potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a bold step by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a strategic move to test the waters and see how willing Alice is to negotiate. $12,000 is still within Bob's budget, but it leaves room for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $22,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $18,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try to bring the price down further. There's no need to buy from John yet, as Bob could potentially get a better deal from Alice with a little more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate.  However, he's also stating this is his ""final offer,"" putting pressure on Alice to accept. $14,000 is still below his $10,000 ""walk-away"" price, leaving room for potential compromise."
