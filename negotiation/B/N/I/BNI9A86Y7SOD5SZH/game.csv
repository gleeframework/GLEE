"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider my costs and the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking $7,000 is a more comfortable price for me. Can you consider it?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $8,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is the same price John is willing to pay, and I'm not sure I want to hold onto the product for much longer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
