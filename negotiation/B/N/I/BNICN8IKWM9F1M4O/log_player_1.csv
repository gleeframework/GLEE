Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  It's a fair price considering the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $92.50? I think that's a fair price for the product.

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
