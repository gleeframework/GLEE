"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $100, which matches my minimum, it makes the most sense to sell it to him now and avoid further negotiation."
