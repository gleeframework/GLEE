"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better deal:** While John is a safe option at $150, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to continue negotiating, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer to show that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing $125 as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the benefits of the deal.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still open to negotiation, leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  That's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better price:** While selling to John is always an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to continue negotiating, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers.
* **Fair Profit:** I'm emphasizing the fact that $117.50 is still a fair profit for me, making it a more appealing offer.
* **Finality:** I'm adding a sense of finality by asking ""What do you say?"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Staying above minimum:** I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $110. This is a fair price, and it's the most I can afford right now.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're at round 6, and there are only 4 rounds left to reach an agreement.
* **No further compromise:** Bob is insistent on $110, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $117.50. 
* **Securing a guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed profit of $150, which is higher than Bob's final offer and within my acceptable range.

I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid further negotiation with Bob, which is unlikely to result in a higher price.  While $110 is better than nothing, I'd rather secure a guaranteed profit with John."
