Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?
