"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, so there is still room to negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value I have in mind, so I'm counteroffering $1,380,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this point.

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,380,000, which is still more than your budget.  Since you can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, it's best to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase from John."
