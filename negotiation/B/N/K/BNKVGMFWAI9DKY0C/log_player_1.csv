Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $150,000, which is significant.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob gets a good deal, saving $50,000, which increases his likelihood of accepting. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters with a lower offer, you have some wiggle room to potentially come down a bit. 

By offering a price that is attractive to Bob, but still beneficial to you, you increase the chances of a successful sale and maximizing your earnings."
