Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and your confidence in the price while remaining open to discussion. 

By setting the initial price high, you increase your chances of securing a deal closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay, ultimately maximizing your profit."
