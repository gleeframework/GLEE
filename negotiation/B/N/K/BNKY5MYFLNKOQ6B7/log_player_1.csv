Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting.  Here's the logic:

* **Higher than minimum:** $14,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $12,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **Not too high:** It's important to consider Bob's perspective.  A price that's too high might make him reject the offer, leaving you with only John's $12,000 offer.

By offering $14,000, you're demonstrating that you value the product, but are also open to negotiation."
