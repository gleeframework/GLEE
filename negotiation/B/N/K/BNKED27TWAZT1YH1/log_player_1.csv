Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

At this point, we're getting close to my fallback option of selling to John.  While I'd like to get more, $17,000 is a reasonable profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether."
