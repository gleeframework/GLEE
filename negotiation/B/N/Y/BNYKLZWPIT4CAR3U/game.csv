"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a substantial investment on my end.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and $1,200,000 is closer to a realistic figure. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,750,000. This acknowledges your interest while recognizing the significant value this product holds.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can finalize a deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
