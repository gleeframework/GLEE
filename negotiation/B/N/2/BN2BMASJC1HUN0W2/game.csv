"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1000000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $962500, as I mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",962500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $962500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $970000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",970000.0,Alice,5,
