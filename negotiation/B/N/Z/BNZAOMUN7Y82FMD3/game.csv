"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal without either of us having to walk away. Let's make this happen.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,062,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,070,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a good middle ground between our last offers, and I believe it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",1070000.0,Alice,5,
