Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be very useful for you. I'm willing to part with it for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your worth:** You know the product's value to you ($100) and have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. This gives you a strong starting point.
* **Don't undervalue:** Offering it at $100 leaves no room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Reasonable markup:** A $120 asking price represents a 20% profit if Bob accepts. This is a reasonable markup, especially if you can highlight the product's value to Bob.
* **First-mover advantage:** Offering it to Bob first creates a sense of exclusivity and might make him more inclined to accept before he potentially loses the opportunity.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer could lead to a more strategic offer."
