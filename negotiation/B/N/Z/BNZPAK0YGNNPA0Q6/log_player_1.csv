{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects it. It also demonstrates that I am confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a great deal for you and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
