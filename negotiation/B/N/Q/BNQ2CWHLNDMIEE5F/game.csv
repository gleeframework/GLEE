,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work. How about $950000? It's a fair compromise and still leaves you with a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but I can't go any lower than $940000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you a good deal. Let's close this now and both be happy.",940000.0,Alice,5,
