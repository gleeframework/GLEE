Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. How about $950,000? It's a fair compromise and still leaves you with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below $950000. How about we meet in the middle at $925000?

While $925,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but I can't go any lower than $940,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you a good deal. Let's close this now and both be happy."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is not progressing quickly enough. I'm concerned that I'm getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers and will not reach my desired price within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee my desired profit."
