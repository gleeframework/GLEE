Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work. How about $950000? It's a fair compromise and still leaves you with a good deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
