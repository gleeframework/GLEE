"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by rejecting Alice's offer.  There's no reason to buy it at her price when I have an alternative.  This allows me to see if I can get a better deal in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $100 is a considerable reduction from her initial offer and represents my initial target price.  This allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially get a deal that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer and only $20 more than my initial counteroffer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers.  This also keeps me within my $150 budget."
