"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would receive from another buyer. This price allows you to acquire the product for a considerable value, and it ensures I receive a favorable return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can proceed to purchase from John at a more favorable price of $1,200,000."
