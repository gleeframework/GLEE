"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $15000 asking price. Would you consider lowering the price or perhaps offering some form of financing or payment plan?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. While I believe this product is worth more, I'm willing to be flexible.  To make this work for both of us, I'm offering the product for $13500. This would allow you to secure the product without exceeding your budget too significantly, while still giving me a fair return. Would you be open to this compromise?",13500.0,Alice,3,
