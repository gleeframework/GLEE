Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is above your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below John's offer:** This means you have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but you're not leaving too much money on the table.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. You have the advantage because John is willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  You're acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Mid-point:** This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). 
* **Reasoning:** You're providing a reason for your price, making it seem more reasonable and fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $108 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. You have a guaranteed $120 from John, making it more advantageous to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John. By rejecting Bob's offer, you have the opportunity to see if you can get closer to your desired price or even get Bob to match your last counteroffer of $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $108 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $109?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 109} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** You're showing flexibility by splitting the difference between your last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($108). 
* **Urgency:**  The ""finalize the deal"" phrasing subtly implies that you're nearing your limit for negotiation and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with, but I'd still like to save a bit more. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $107 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You've already made several counteroffers and it's clear that Bob is trying to get the lowest possible price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $120, as this guarantees you a higher profit than you would get with Bob. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price, potentially even below your minimum."
