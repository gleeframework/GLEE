"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy this product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, however, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
