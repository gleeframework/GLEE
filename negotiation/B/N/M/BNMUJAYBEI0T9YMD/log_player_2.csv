# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth more than a million dollars to you.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is only slightly below your absolute maximum price and significantly above what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you create an opportunity for negotiation.  Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale entirely.  Even if she only comes down a little, you'll still save money compared to buying from John."
