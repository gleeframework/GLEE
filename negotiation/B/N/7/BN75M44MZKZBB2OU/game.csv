"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I need to ensure a fair deal. Would you consider $1,300,000? This feels like a good middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
