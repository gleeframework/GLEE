{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential counteroffers. It's important to be confident and persuasive while still being open to negotiation.  I've chosen a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum value. I need to try and get a better price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
