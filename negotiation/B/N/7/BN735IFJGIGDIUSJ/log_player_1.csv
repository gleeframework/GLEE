"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum to allow for back-and-forth and potential compromise. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.
* **More negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $9,500 just yet.
* **Avoiding risk:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, but I'm not ready to take that risk just yet. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $9,800. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** I'm still above my minimum value, which protects my interests.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as a fair deal for both of us, increasing the likelihood of agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $9600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable settling. 
* **Room for a final compromise:** I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round, perhaps a compromise between $9,600 and $9,800.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better deal with Bob.

I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation just yet. I believe I can still secure a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product for $9,700. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.  It's a compromise, but still above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** By suggesting splitting the difference, I'm appealing to Bob's desire for a quick and easy resolution.
* **Positive language:**  I use positive language to emphasize that this is a fair price for both of us, making the deal more appealing. 
* **Emphasis on closing:** I'm highlighting the opportunity to close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to offer $9650 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not quite:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but it's still $350 below it. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lowball me, wasting more rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of ending up with an even lower offer.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, there's not much time for further negotiation.

It's better to be certain of getting my minimum value than to risk getting a lower price from Bob. I'll sell to John and move on."
