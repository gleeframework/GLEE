"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is a better price than $120, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this item to my attention.  However, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This feels like a fair price that considers both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is still a better price than John's offer of $120. It's also closer to your ideal price point. Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product while still saving some money."
