"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
