Alice's offer:

I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,050,000. This price is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think $975,000 is still a bit low for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is consistently trying to anchor the price above $1,000,000.  While she might come down slightly again, it's unlikely she'll go below John's offer.  To avoid further negotiation and potentially missing out on the product entirely, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
