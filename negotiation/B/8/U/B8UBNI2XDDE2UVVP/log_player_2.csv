Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price or lower?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, I'm not able to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still being a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to my target price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
