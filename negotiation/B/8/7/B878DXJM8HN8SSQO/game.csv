"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This would allow me to secure the product while still staying within my financial constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,125,000.
