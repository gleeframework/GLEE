"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary.** There's room to negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You'll lose $500,000 by going to John, so it's best to see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum value.
* **More negotiation is possible.** There's still room to push for a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown some willingness to compromise.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** It's better to keep negotiating with Alice and see if you can get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This would allow me to secure the product while still staying within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $1,125,000 is below your maximum value of $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John is too high.
* **This is a good deal for you.** You're getting the product for a significant discount compared to John's price, and Alice is still getting a decent profit."
