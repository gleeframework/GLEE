"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $102 is very close to my ideal price and significantly better than selling to John for $80. There's a chance that Bob might reject my counteroffer, which could lead to a lower price or even a deal with John. It's better to secure the deal now and avoid risking a less favorable outcome."
