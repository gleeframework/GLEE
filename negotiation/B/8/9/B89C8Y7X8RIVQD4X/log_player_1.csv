Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I am proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can confidently start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""immense value"" and ""other interested parties"" to create a sense of scarcity and urgency, justifying the high price. 
* **Limited-Time Element:**  By mentioning it's a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on the deal. 

**Goal:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit. While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, the potential gain from his acceptance (an extra $500,000) outweighs the risk of going directly to your backup buyer."
