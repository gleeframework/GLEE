"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and meeting me halfway. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $950,000.  My final offer is $980,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your final offer. I understand that $980,000 is a competitive price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
