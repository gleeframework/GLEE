"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $10,000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering its actual value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,750? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,000.  Would you consider $7,250? ",7250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",7500.0,Alice,7,
