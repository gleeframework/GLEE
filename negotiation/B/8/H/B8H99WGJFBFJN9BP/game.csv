"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I need to get closer to my asking price to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose an additional condition: if you can throw in some additional support or services with the product, I'd be willing to meet you at $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the willingness to move closer on the price. However, I'm not comfortable adding additional support or services at this point.  I understand your perspective on the value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's compromise at $1,325,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a fair agreement without requiring extra commitments.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
