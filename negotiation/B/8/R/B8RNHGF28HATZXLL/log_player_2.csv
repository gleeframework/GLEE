Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $85. I think the product's value is still worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and at this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $80."
