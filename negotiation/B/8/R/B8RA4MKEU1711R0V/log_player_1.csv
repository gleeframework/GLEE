Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still lower than the value Bob places on the product ($150). This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose money."
