Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, and I believe it's attractive enough for Bob to consider. If he rejects, we can continue to negotiate. However, I'm prepared to walk away at any time and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and send a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. I'm still prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm moving a little closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. This price represents a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's latest offer is very close to my desired price point, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
