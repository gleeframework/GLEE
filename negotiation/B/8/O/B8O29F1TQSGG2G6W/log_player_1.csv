Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be even more valuable than Bob initially thought.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he outright rejects it, we know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, it indicates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob."
