Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It meets my absolute minimum, but I know it's worth significantly more to him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not for a loss."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle of my original offer and your last offer, at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000, but he's willing to budge slightly. I need to demonstrate I'm willing to move, but not too drastically.  I'll aim slightly above his offer to keep the negotiation moving."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You're right, $1,300,000 might be a big jump. How about $1,270,000?  That reflects the value it holds for you while recognizing your budget concerns."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,240,000, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to my target. How about $1,230,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is getting closer, but I need to hold firm a bit longer.  The increments are getting smaller, suggesting he's nearing his maximum. I'll offer a smaller concession to test this."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tricky decision point. Bob seems to be very anchored at the $1,200,000 mark and is moving in very small increments now. While $1,220,000 is a decent offer, I still believe he might be willing to go a bit higher. It's a gamble, but I'll risk one more counteroffer."

Round 9

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've made it clear that $1,200,000 is my maximum budget. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I need a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge beyond $1,200,000. It's been a long negotiation, and he's laid down his final offer. While I could try another round, it's highly unlikely he'll change his position. John offers the same amount, and I'd rather avoid the risk of Bob walking away entirely. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
