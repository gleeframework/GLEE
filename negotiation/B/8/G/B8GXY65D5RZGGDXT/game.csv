"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000, considering its value and potential.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum.  Would you be willing to do $15,500? That's a significant reduction on my part.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $15,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  What if we split the difference between our last two offers and landed at $14,250?",14250.0,Bob,6,
