"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
