# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

You have three options:

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000. This means there's a significant margin for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  That's still a good deal for you and leaves room for us both to be happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to let go of the product at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal considering it's still below my maximum budget of $15,000, and it allows me to acquire the product without further negotiation."
