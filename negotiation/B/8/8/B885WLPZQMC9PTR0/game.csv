,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I can't go lower than that.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $6,000. How about $6,750? That's a fair compromise.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $6,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,000. That's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers, how about $6,875?",6875.0,Bob,6,
