Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm confident this price is fair considering the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  your offer is quite a bit below what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the significant value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum requirement of $1,500,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at that price, making it the most logical decision at this point."
