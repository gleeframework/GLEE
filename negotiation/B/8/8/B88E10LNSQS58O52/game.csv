"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from your desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $100, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $105. This is the best I can do without losing money on the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart.
