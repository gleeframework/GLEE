,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget constraint, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your offer, but I'm still not able to meet at $92.5. I'm willing to pay up to $90 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
