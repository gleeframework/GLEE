"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate.  However,  $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $750,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is valuable.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a substantial amount for me, but I recognize the value this product can bring to your business. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However,  the gap between our positions is still significant. To be completely transparent, I have another option for $800,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  If you can meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
