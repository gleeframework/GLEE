"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but still below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation without risking selling too low.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value can make Bob more willing to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **There are still rounds remaining.** I have 9 rounds left to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option.** However, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests.
* **Emphasize value for Bob:** Reminding Bob that even at $1,200,000, it's a good deal for him can encourage him to consider it.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the communication friendly keeps the negotiation open and avoids making Bob feel pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate.  However,  $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $750,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is valuable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, $750,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **There's still room for improvement.**  I have 6 rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is a safe fallback.**  However, I'm not desperate and want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a substantial amount for me, but I recognize the value this product can bring to your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm making another significant concession, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the product's value for Bob:** Emphasizing the product's potential benefits for his business can make him more willing to invest.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking for his response keeps the negotiation active and encourages Bob to think about accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However,  the gap between our positions is still significant. To be completely transparent, I have another option for $800,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  If you can meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** Even though he's mentioned an alternative, $800,000 is still significantly less than my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **There are still rounds left.**  I have 4 rounds remaining to try and reach a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is always a secure option.**  However, I'm not desperate yet.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and see if I can improve the deal further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the win-win:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer benefits both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to see the value in closing the deal.
* **Direct Question:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to keep the negotiation active and encourage a response.
* **Time is Running Out:** With 3 rounds left, it's important to show flexibility while maintaining my desired outcome."
