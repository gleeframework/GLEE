Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $175 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit beyond your minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:**  By mentioning ""special price"" and ""great deal for its value,"" you aim to nudge Bob towards accepting the higher price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit with Bob while still maintaining the safety net of selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
