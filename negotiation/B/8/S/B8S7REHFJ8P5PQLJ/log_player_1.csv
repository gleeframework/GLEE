{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  This initial offer allows for some flexibility, while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I make a profit. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between your needs and mine. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I make a profit. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
