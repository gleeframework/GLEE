"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $12,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no advantage to buying from her. You can get the product for the same price from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to keep your options open in case you can find a better deal elsewhere."
