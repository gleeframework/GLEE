"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you're aiming to save money, you should try to negotiate with Alice first.  You can always buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's 10% lower than Alice's initial price is a reasonable starting point. It shows you're serious about negotiating while leaving room for further compromise.  It's also a good strategy to test the waters and see how flexible Alice might be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not low enough.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can push for a lower price.  You still have several rounds left, and it's worth trying to get the best deal possible before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice moved to $7,500, I'm going to meet her halfway.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price. This approach keeps the negotiation moving and puts pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price.  At this point, it's a good deal considering I can always buy from John for $8,000. It's worth accepting the offer and saving $600. I've already made good progress in negotiation, and it's not worth the risk of pushing further and potentially losing the deal."
