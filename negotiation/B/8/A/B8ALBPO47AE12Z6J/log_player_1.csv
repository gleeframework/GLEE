"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  Using a friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to see if Bob is willing to go close to my price. If he's not, I can then adjust my offer in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum price of $80.  
* **There's room for negotiation:**  I can still try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **I haven't exhausted all rounds:**  With 8 rounds left, I can continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's still a great price for a product you value at $150."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Building towards a compromise:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price in the next round."
