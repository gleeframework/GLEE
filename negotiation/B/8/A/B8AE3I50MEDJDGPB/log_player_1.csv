{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000 but leaves some room for negotiation, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at my minimum price, I'm willing to try to get closer to my desired price of $11,500. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
