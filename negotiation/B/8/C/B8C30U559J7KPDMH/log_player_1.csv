"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential for future growth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Framing the Offer:** The message highlights the value of the product and the potential for growth. This encourages Bob to see the offer as a good investment.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $1,400,000, I'm allowing for several rounds of negotiation before needing to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,050,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000). Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and still have the option of selling to John. There's room to counter Bob's offer and try to secure a better price.
* **Staying firm:** Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate and willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is halfway between Bob's offer ($1,050,000) and my previous offer ($1,400,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining value:**  $1,250,000 is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a better price than his offer. 
* **Reiterating value:**  The message emphasizes the discount and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could we settle at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $1,125,000 is still below what the product is worth to me, and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better price.  There's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my minimum.
* **Avoiding loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss, whereas selling to John guarantees my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,200,000? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and your interest in it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  This offer is halfway between my previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,125,000). It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and highlights the opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal. This helps to create a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider accepting the offer.
* **Increasing pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm subtly increasing the pressure by suggesting this is the final offer.

By this point, I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  We'll see if he's ready to close the deal!"
