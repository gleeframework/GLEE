"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775000? That's my final offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $820000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",820000.0,Alice,5,
