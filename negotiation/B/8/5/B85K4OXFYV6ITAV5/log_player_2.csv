The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $9,500.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you think it's worth $8,500 to you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $9,200 is still more than you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."
