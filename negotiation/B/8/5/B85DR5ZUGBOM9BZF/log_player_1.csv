{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $10,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000), giving him incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate further without going too low.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Selling to John right now would mean no profit from the negotiation.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Signal your willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob you're not desperate for a sale at his price.
* **Explore a higher counteroffer:** You can attempt to bridge the gap between $8,000 and your desired price. 

Let's see if we can get closer to your target with a counteroffer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for both of us, and it leaves some room for compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  $9,000 is halfway between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Still profitable:** It's above your minimum, so you're still making a profit.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, there's still room to move down a bit more before you reach your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good profit:**  $8,500 is a decent profit for you, exceeding your minimum of $8,000.
* **No further negotiation:**  It's unlikely Bob will go higher, as he's already met you halfway.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject, Bob might walk away, and you'd only be able to sell to John for $8,000.

This is a solid deal that secures a good profit without risking a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
