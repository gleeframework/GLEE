Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $85}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $75. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay more than $75. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price of $80.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $82}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $75, and I want to get closer to my minimum price of $80, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $80}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at my minimum price!"
