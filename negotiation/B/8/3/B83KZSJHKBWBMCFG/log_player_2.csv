"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?

Alice is negotiating, but there's still room to push further down towards our target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Alice has indicated this is her lowest price.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's risky, as she might hold firm. Accepting $700,000 secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
