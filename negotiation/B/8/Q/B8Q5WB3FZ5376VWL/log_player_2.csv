Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'll throw in a special deal - I'll give you a 5% discount, so the price would be $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a great value.
