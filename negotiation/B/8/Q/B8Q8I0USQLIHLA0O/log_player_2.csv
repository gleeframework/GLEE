"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While the product is worth more to Alice, you have the option to buy from John for a much lower price. It's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I see the value in this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about we settle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to your initial counteroffer, you have a guaranteed alternative with John. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can secure a price closer to your limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I value finding common ground, the product's worth is firmly above $1,150,000.  My final offer is $1,187,500. This reflects my best attempt to bridge the gap while respecting the product's value.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,187,500 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at a price that fits your budget, it's the most logical decision to buy from John and secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
