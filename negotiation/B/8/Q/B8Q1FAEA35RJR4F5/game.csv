"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",16000.0,Bob,4,
