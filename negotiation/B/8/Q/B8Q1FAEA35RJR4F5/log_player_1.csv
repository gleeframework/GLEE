Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and quality, I'm asking for $22,000.  I think you'll find it's a very fair price."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and makes it more likely Bob will counter with a price closer to your acceptable range. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even though Bob's value is lower, the higher initial price may influence his counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The large difference between your asking price and Bob's perceived value gives you ample room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is still substantially lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiating Power:** You have the option to sell to John for $15,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation.  Bob's offer doesn't yet justify walking away from that guaranteed price. 
* **Room for Movement:** There's a significant gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting there's space for further negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your initial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 19000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  A $3,000 reduction from your initial offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and your guaranteed alternative.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value of the product,"" you subtly remind Bob of its worth and counter his lower valuation. 
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, encouraging him to move closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is now higher than your guaranteed $15,000 from John. 
* **Strong Negotiation:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up significantly from his initial offer of $12,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk that Bob walks away if you push too hard. Accepting his current offer secures a very good deal for you."
