"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price, considering you value it at $10,000 and I'm already offering a significant amount.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500. However, I'm still a bit far from my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This is a fair compromise, as I'm already willing to go below my minimum price. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement on this.",10000.0,Bob,6,
