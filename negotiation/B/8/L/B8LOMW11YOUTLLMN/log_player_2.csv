Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $115 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $125. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's final offer is still higher than my maximum price point ($120).  Since I have the option of buying from John for that price, I'll take that deal.  There's no point in risking another round with Alice and potentially ending up paying more."
