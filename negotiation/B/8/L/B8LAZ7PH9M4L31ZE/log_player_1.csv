Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $200 gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Openness:**  Stating ""open to negotiation"" shows I'm willing to work with Bob, increasing his chances of accepting. 
* **Value unknown:**  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, starting high allows me to potentially capture a higher profit.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 provides a floor for my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest. This indicates there's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point. This will give me a better chance of maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $175 is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Remaining firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $175 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't settle for too little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further negotiation:** There's no room for a counteroffer that would be more profitable. 
* **Avoiding risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer risks losing him as a buyer. 
* **Equal value:**  Selling to Bob for $150 yields the same outcome as selling to John.  It's a fair price."
