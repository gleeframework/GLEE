{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $10,000 to both of us, there's a potential surplus we can negotiate within. This offer aims to capture a significant portion of that surplus."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe your product is of good quality, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. It makes sense to negotiate further as there's a large gap to potentially bridge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility but hold firm:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Highlight value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the higher price.
* **Aim for a win-win:**  $11,000 is a price that gives me a profit and is still potentially a good deal for Bob considering his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
