"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget for this is $120. Would you be willing to consider that? ",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I can do $165, which is a compromise between our two prices. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for a great product like this. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $165 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can do $155, which is still a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $145.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll need to go with another seller.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I can do $160, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",160.0,Alice,7,
