"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
