"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm really interested in the product, but my absolute maximum is $120.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to go with another offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
