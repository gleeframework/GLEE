"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $200 is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,4,
