Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a good starting point because it's a fair price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* This gives Bob a sense of getting a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* The message is friendly and persuasive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* I'm also reminding him of the product's value to him, hoping to motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can still get closer to my goal of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,500 for the product.  Would you be willing to meet me at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,250** is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* The message is still friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* The message reiterates the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of logic and reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your follow-up offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,100 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still compensating you fairly for its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, the negotiation has stalled, and Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that the process will drag on, potentially leading to a lower price or a complete breakdown in negotiations. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further uncertainty."
