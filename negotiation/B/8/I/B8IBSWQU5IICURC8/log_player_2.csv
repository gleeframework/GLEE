Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product is truly exceptional and holds a significant value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1,550,000. It's a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us.
