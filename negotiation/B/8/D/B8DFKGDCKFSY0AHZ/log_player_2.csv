Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for my budget. Could you do $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, she is unlikely to reach a price that beats John's offer of $100. It's better to secure the product at a known good price now than risk Alice not going low enough and wasting negotiation rounds."
