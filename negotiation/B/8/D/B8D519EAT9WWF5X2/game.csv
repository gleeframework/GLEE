,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I can only go up to $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to show my commitment to this deal.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, my absolute minimum, considering the unique value of this product. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this price, I'm ready to move forward with the deal.",920000.0,Bob,6,
