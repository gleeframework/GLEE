Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than your backup offer from John ($10,000), ensuring a good profit."
