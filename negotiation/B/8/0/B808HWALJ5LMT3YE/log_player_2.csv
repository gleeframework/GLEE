(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the door open for negotiation (she might lower her price) or you can proceed with buying from John and save $1,500."
