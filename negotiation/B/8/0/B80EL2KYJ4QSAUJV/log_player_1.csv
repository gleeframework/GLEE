{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where you're getting a good price, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is not willing to accept.  By starting at $1,250,000 you have $250,000 in wiggle room before you'd have to consider John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is important to me, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $400,000 less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original offer.  How about $1,150,000? This is a significant price point for me, but I believe it still represents a great value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
