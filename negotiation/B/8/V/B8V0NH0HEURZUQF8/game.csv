"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $112. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",112.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling it for $108. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",115.0,Alice,5,
