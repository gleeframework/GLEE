"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'll sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more than John's offer. You can save $2,000 by going with John."
