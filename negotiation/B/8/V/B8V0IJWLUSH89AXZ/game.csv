"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your valuation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both parties. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet at $900,000. I would like to propose $875,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",875000.0,Bob,4,
