"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and significantly less than you'd pay elsewhere.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than what Alice values the product at, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
