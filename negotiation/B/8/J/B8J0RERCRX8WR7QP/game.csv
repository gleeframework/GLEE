"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and significantly less than you'd pay elsewhere.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. $9,000 is still a bit too low for me though.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a bit of profit. Let's try to make this work! ",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering what I can get it for elsewhere, and it gives you a decent profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
