"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for a price that reflects its value. I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. My asking price is $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know your decision, and we can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,150,000.** This is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **John's price is $1,200,000.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
