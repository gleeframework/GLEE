"Alice, your offer is much higher than what I'm able to pay right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a very fair price for a product of this caliber.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,600,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
