{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the absolute lowest price possible. Since John is willing to sell for $800,000, that's Bob's ideal price. This counteroffer is the best possible starting point for negotiation.  If Alice rejects, Bob can always walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation.  Bob can still get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. While Alice's last offer was still too high, Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than his initial offer of $800,000. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget than previous ones, it's still higher than his maximum of $800,000.  It's worth one more attempt to negotiate, but if Alice rejects this next counteroffer, Bob should buy from John to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final attempt to negotiate with Alice.  He's raised his offer from $900,000 to $950,000, showing some flexibility while staying within his budget. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will purchase the product from John for $800,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price, and Bob has already made several counteroffers.  It's time to move on and secure the product from John at a price within his budget."
