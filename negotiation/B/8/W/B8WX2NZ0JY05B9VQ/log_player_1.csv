Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $11,500, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also highlighting the potential ""deal"" aspect to make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point. I'm leaving room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also aware of my fallback option with John, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $11,000, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not giving away too much.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and reiterating the ""fair price"" aspect, which could be appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

By meeting in the middle, I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still staying above my minimum price. If Bob is truly interested, this counteroffer could be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While there's a chance we could continue to negotiate, it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge significantly further.  

To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further haggling with Bob."
