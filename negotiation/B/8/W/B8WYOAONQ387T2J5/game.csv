"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about we settle at $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going above $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $13,750 is the absolute maximum I can go. Can we agree on that?",13750.0,Bob,4,
