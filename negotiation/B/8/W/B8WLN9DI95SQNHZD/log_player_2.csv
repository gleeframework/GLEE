"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its value and your needs. Would you be open to exploring options together? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
