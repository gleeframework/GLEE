Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering it at $145 gives Bob a chance to get it for a price he might find acceptable, while still netting me a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so I'm not desperate. This gives me leverage to aim for a higher price with Bob. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $145 seems like a more appealing ""deal"" compared to a round number like $150. It might make Bob feel like he's getting a better bargain."
