"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1050000. How about we meet at $990000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you closer to your target. I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. Can you consider this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1015000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's as low as I can reasonably go. Let's see if we can finally meet in the middle.",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1005000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1005000.0,Alice,9,
