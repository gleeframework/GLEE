"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above what Bob values the product at. He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair to both him and Alice. He knows that Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000, so he is offering a price that is closer to his own valuation of $12,000.  He is hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but if she doesn't, he can continue to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $9,500 is still above Bob's valuation of $8,000, it is a good deal for Bob considering he has only 7 rounds left to negotiate.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves $2,500 compared to buying from John."
