"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth more to Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and I think I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers. I hope this will be enough to entice him while still getting me closer to my goal."
