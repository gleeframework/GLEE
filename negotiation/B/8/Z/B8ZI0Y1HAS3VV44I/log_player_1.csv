Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($10,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to me to create a sense of urgency and potentially make Bob more willing to pay.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone can help establish a good rapport with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation. I'm willing to negotiate but am also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is not willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $9,500. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($10,000).** While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price.** There's a chance I can negotiate further with Bob and get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. This strategy may encourage Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $9,250? This would allow me to make this sale, while still getting closer to my initial asking price. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's offer:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to meet Bob halfway, creating a sense of fairness and encouraging him to reciprocate.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging can help facilitate a successful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a final agreement. I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility and willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I am now offering $9,100 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($10,000).**  Even though it's getting closer, I'm unwilling to compromise further at this point.
* **I'm confident in selling to John.** John is a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my full asking price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob if I can secure a better deal elsewhere.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John is the most logical choice. It minimizes risk and guarantees me the best possible outcome.  While I would like to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing a sure deal for a potential but uncertain outcome."
