Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, but you also need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Securing a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at this price point ensures you earn significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000 from John)."
