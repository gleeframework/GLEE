{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value we each place on it."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for $12,000 either. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Bob has a clear alternative with John offering the product for his target price. Therefore, Bob should reject this offer and continue to negotiate or explore the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement without compromising too much."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Bob has a reliable alternative with John offering the product for his target price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of going over budget or reaching the round limit without a deal. Therefore, the best option for Bob is to buy the product from John and secure a deal within his budget."
