"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not convinced that the product's value is worth $14200. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14300. This is the last offer I'm willing to make. What do you think?",14300.0,Alice,5,
