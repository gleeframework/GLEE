"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is certainly a number we can discuss, it's significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects the value proposition and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
