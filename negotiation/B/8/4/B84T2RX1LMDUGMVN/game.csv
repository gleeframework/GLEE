"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer that considers both our needs. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,220,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get close to your target price, but $1,220,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my seriousness in acquiring this product.  This price also reflects the value it holds for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

My counteroffer is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
