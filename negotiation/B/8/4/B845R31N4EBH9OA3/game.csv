"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
