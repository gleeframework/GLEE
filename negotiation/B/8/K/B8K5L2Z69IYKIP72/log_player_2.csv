"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  While buying from John at $1,000,000 is an option, there's always a chance Bob can negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  This aggressive counteroffer will hopefully force Alice to reconsider her position.  If Alice rejects this, Bob can still choose to buy from John, but the counteroffer opens the door for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget. However, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  The goal is to get as close to the $1,000,000 mark as possible without risking losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer to $950,000. This is still lower than Alice's offer but a significant jump from his previous offer, showing Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway.  This also keeps the price below the $1,000,000 mark he'd pay to John.  The idea is to find a compromise that works for both parties."
