Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Floor:**  My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price that is a significant discount from Bob's value, but still well above my minimum. This increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a good profit.

By offering $1,450,000, I'm maximizing my potential profit while also giving Bob a good deal."
