"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) but lower than what you're willing to pay from John ($1,500,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **By rejecting the offer, you force Alice to potentially lower her price to secure the deal.** 
* **You can then counter-offer with a price closer to your maximum ($1,500,000) or wait to see if Alice comes back with a better offer.**"
