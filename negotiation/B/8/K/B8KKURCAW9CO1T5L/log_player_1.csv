Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $120 initially leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, indicating flexibility. 
* **Positive framing:**  Highlighting the product's value and appealing to Bob's potential interest creates a positive first impression.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer that could be beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $120 and my desired target. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Explore higher offers:**  By making a counteroffer, I might be able to push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Assess Bob's true interest:** If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to increase his offer after my counteroffer.

This approach allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Offering $105 represents a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message remains positive and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial price.
* **Highlighting the value:** The ""meet in the middle"" approach subtly reinforces the product's value by implying a compromise.

This counteroffer aims to secure a price closer to my desired target while keeping the negotiation amicable and leaving room for further discussion if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget, I can agree to $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** Bob's offer of $100 is just $5 away from my previous counteroffer of $105 and is significantly closer to my desired target than his initial offer of $90. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting the offer eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection, which could lead to selling the product to John for a lower price of $80.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
