Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor, But Below Your Minimum:** This offer starts at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your guaranteed sale price with John. This creates room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before it goes to someone else (John) might incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially pay a premium.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob's specific situation, potentially increasing his perceived worth. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Negotiation is highly situational. You could adjust your offer based on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
