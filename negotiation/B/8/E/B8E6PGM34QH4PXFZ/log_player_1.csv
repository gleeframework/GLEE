Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $100. It's worth exploring if we can negotiate further.  I'm willing to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $102.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 102} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $102 is still a bit above my budget. Can we try $98? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer with his offers, I'm running out of rounds.  To guarantee I at least make my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's not the ideal price, but it's a secure deal."
