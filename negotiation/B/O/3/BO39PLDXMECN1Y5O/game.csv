"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,500 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",15000.0,Alice,5,
