I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what Bob values the product at, but still below my minimum. This allows for some room for negotiation, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll try to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  John is offering my minimum price, and it's better to guarantee a sale rather than risk continued negotiation with Bob."
