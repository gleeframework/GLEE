Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. This is a unique item that I'm confident will exceed your expectations. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a high offer of $1,850,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""immense value"" and ""unique"" nature of the product, attempting to justify the high price.
* **Direct Approach:**  The tone is confident and direct, making it clear that you believe in the product's worth. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob and your risk tolerance, you might choose a different approach."
