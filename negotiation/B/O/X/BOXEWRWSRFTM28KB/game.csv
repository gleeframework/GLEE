"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product presents a great opportunity,  that price is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see the value in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $900,000. How about we try $1,050,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down Alice, I appreciate the compromise.  To make this work for me, I would need to get the price closer to $950,000. Would you be open to that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. This is my final offer for now.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
