"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. 
* You have a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $950000 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate further. If I reject, I can make another counteroffer, hopefully getting closer to my desired price.
* I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, which is still a better deal than Alice's current offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and my target profit. I can do $920000, but that's as low as I can go.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. 
* While I could continue negotiating, it's unclear if I'll be able to get Alice down to my desired price.
* I have a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, which is the best option available right now. It's better to lock in that price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
