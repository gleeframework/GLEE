Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."

While Bob's offer is a little higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm going to sell the product to John. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a secure deal that meets my minimum requirements."
