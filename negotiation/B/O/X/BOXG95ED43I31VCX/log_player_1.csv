Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $18,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're starting strong.
* **It's not too high:**  You don't want to scare Bob off with an unreasonable price. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you can still make a profit and have some room to compromise.

Remember, this is just the first offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $16000 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum ($12,000), it's still lower than your initial asking price ($18,000).  You have a few reasons to reject his offer:

* **Room for improvement:** There's still some negotiation space. You can likely get closer to your initial asking price with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer:** Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000. This gives you a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price that's closer to your initial asking price, but still within a reasonable range for Bob. It's important to maintain a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a deal is reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position. While $16,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work. How about $17,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for acceptance:** $17,000 is still higher than what Bob offered but might be tempting enough for him to accept.
* **Room to decline:** If Bob still rejects, you can still go down to John's offer of $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:** Carefully consider his next move and adjust your strategy accordingly.
* **Prepare for John's offer:** If Bob rejects, you might need to reach out to John to secure the $12,000 sale."
