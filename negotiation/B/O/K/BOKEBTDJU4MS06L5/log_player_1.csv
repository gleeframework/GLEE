Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a quicker deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $800,000, ensuring you won't lose money if Bob declines.
* **Confident Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" adds perceived value to the offer."
