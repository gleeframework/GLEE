"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **High initial offer:** This sets a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of his value range.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to be aggressive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  

* **Rejecting and counter-offering:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price range.
* **Remaining flexible:** While $1,500,000 is tempting,  I'm not desperate and I can still secure a profit with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,700,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. 

* **Moving closer:** This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my initial target. 
* **Testing the waters:** If Bob rejects this, I'll have a better sense of his true willingness to pay.
* **Time is ticking:** With limited rounds, I'm starting to move more decisively towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is within my acceptable range and represents a good profit.  Since time is running out, I'm choosing to accept this offer and secure the deal.  

Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further rejection:** There's a risk that Bob will continue to reject offers, and I might not be able to reach a better price within the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to close the deal with Bob at a price that's still very favorable."
