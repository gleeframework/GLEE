"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
