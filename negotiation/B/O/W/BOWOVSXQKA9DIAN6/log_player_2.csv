"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,200,000. I can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There's a good chance Alice will negotiate further, as she's likely willing to sell for a price closer to her value of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum price point. I'm going to reject this offer and try to counter-offer again. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $850,000."
