"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $800,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still within my budget. This should hopefully open the negotiation process and give me a better understanding of Alice's price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though she lowered it.  I will continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  While I can buy from John for $1,000,000, I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Alice if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but still wants a price higher than my target.  I'm going to increase my offer by $150,000 to $950,000.  This is closer to her last offer and hopefully signals I'm serious about striking a deal, while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, and I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000 for the product. Even though I have a backup option with John, I believe I can still negotiate a lower price with Alice.  While I am running out of rounds, I want to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at my maximum price of $1,000,000. This is a reasonable price, as I am willing to buy from John for that amount.  Hopefully, Alice is willing to meet me at this price to finalize the deal. If she rejects, I will have no choice but to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, and with only a few rounds remaining, it's unlikely she will come down to my desired price. It's better to secure the product now from John at $1,000,000, which is within my budget.  This ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of further negotiations failing."
