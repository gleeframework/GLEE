"Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $150. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $165. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. Would you consider $155? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $160. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
