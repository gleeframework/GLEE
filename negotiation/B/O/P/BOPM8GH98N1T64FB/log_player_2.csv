"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is closer to her value than mine. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant jump down, aiming to bring the price closer to my ideal range. By starting low, I leave room for negotiation while still signaling my strong interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle for $11,500?"",

}
``` 

This offer shows willingness to compromise and suggests a price point that's a fair compromise between both our initial offers."
