Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still attractive to Bob. I'm also keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'd rather risk a bit more by rejecting and counteroffering to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $8,500, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,250? This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum and Bob is also showing good faith. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice, as it's unlikely we'll get much closer to my ideal price. The risk of further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away, and I'm comfortable with the $8,875 offer."
