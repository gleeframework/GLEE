"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're thinking.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle is a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,120,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from the original price, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to meeting you at $1,110,000, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,107,500. It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
