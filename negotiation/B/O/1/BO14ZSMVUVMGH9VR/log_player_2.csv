"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price I'm comfortable with in just one round, so it's better to reject her offer and see if we can negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still represents a good deal for her. This should open up the negotiation process and give us both room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000,  which reflects the product's unique value and the potential it holds. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me, though she has come down a bit.  While I want to continue negotiating, I need to be careful as we only have 7 rounds remaining. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000, which is closer to Alice's price but still within my budget. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and suggesting that it's a good opportunity to close the deal. This should encourage Alice to consider my proposal and move closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $975,000. This price is fair, considering the product's unique value and the potential we've discussed. It's a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget. I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating, and I believe I can push for a lower price. I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target with a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my current budget. I'm confident that we can reach a final agreement with this offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but this time to a price that's closer to my maximum budget. I'm also emphasizing the potential of the product and the fairness of my offer. This should encourage Alice to accept, as she's likely to see that I'm serious about buying the product and that this price is a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still slightly lower than where I need to be.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $965,000. This price is a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and your budget.  I hope we can close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my preferred price. I have three rounds remaining, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'll reject her offer and make a final counteroffer to try and close the deal closer to my desired price.  If this fails, I can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $965,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $960,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and my budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer, and I'm pushing for a price that is very close to my maximum budget. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and that this is my final attempt to reach an agreement. This pressure tactic should encourage Alice to consider accepting, especially as she has already made several concessions.  If she rejects this offer, I'll be ready to move on to John."
