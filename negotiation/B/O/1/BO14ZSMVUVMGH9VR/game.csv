"Alice,  $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000,  which reflects the product's unique value and the potential it holds. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
