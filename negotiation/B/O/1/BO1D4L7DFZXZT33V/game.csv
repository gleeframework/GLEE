"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for this product. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $8000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Would you be willing to go up to $10000?  That would still be a good deal for you, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's see if we can find some common ground!",10000.0,Alice,3,
