"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the potential in this product, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above your budget. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,200,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend. It's more sensible to secure the product from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
