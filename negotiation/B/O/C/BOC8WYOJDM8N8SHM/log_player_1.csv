"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:**  Expressing excitement and belief in the product's value for Bob can make him more open to negotiating. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $175 is a reasonable starting point, allowing for several rounds of negotiation before hitting my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 10 rounds and haven't exhausted my options yet.  I can counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my goal. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $150, so there's no immediate need to accept a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $120 is a bit too far below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That would still give you a great deal on this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Positive language:**  Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""amazing product"" keeps the conversation positive.
* **Emphasize the value:**  Reiterating the value of the product reinforces the idea that a higher price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More negotiation rounds available:** We still have 6 rounds remaining. This gives me more opportunities to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer remains an option:** I can still sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. It's not worth accepting a price that is significantly below my minimum, especially when I have more options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $140. That's a good deal for both of us, and you'll get to enjoy this fantastic product!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still holding onto some value.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  My message emphasizes that the price is a ""good deal"" for both of us and encourages Bob to close the deal.
* **Remaining above minimum:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely closer to Bob's budget than my previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $135. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Only 4 rounds left:** While we're getting closer, I'm not willing to accept a price significantly below my minimum with only 4 rounds remaining.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  Selling to John for $150 is still a viable option if this negotiation fails. 
* **Opportunity for higher counteroffer:** With limited rounds remaining, it might be worth risking one more counteroffer to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet at $142? It's only a little higher than your last offer, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm confident you'll really enjoy using this product!"", ""product_price"": 142} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still getting closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I reiterate my belief that the product will be enjoyed and reiterate that this is close to what I need to make the sale worthwhile, making my position more understandable.
* **Only 3 rounds left:**  With limited rounds, it's time to try and secure a price that's closer to my goal.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer still keeps the potential of selling to John for $150 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 2 rounds left, the likelihood of Bob significantly increasing his offer is slim. 
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's offer guarantees my minimum:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees that I'll reach my minimum acceptable price. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high.  Selling to John ensures I secure a safe and profitable outcome."
