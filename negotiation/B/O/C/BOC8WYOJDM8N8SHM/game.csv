"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $120 is a bit too far below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That would still give you a great deal on this amazing product.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,4,
