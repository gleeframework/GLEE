# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $15,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I propose to sell it to you for $12,000. This price reflects a significant value proposition while ensuring we can maintain a fair profit margin.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, which might prompt Alice to lower her price."
