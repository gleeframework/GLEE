"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but $9,500 is still too close to that limit.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  There's room for negotiation since Alice's offer is above her minimum desired price of $8,000. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John, but you want to try to get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate. It's also within your budget.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $9,000 is still above Alice's minimum desired price, so there's a chance she'll accept. 
* **Sets the stage for future rounds:** If Alice rejects, you'll have a clear basis for further counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm holding firm at $9,200. I know this product will be a huge benefit for you, and I'm confident it's worth this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** $9,200 is still closer to your maximum than her minimum. 
* **Opportunity for a compromise:** While Alice is holding firm, there's still room for a counteroffer that finds a middle ground.
* **Negotiation is key:**  You're not ready to give up on getting a better price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,200 is still a bit high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,100.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's price, showing that you're willing to compromise.
* **Appeals to fairness:**  The message highlights that $9,100 is a ""fair price"" that benefits both sides, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Sets the stage for final rounds:**  If Alice rejects, you'll be closer to her desired price and have fewer rounds left."
