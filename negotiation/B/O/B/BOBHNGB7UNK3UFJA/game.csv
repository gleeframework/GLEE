"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price, what do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22,000 is way out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $10,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $15,500.  This feels like a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
