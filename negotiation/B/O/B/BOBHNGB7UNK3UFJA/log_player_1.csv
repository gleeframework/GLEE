"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $22,000 is way out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $10,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $15,500.  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his $12,000 offer. Accepting it means a $3,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
