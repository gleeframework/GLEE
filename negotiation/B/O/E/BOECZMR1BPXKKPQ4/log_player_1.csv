"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not excessively so. I believe this gives me a good chance of getting a good deal while still being within a range that Bob might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. I think this could be a sweet spot where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive with his offers, but $110 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This is my bottom line. I'm willing to sell the product for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I will be forced to sell to John."
