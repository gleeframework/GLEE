"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident it's a fair starting point for discussions.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's work together to find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To move things forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,325,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our positions.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,325,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe reflects a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
