"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This price is lower than what I'd get from another buyer, but I believe in the value this product can bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than what she'd get from another buyer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a price that fits within his budget."
