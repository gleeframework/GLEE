Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John offers $800,000, Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This still ensures a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair reflection of that value, making it more appealing to Bob."
