Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's also below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him some room to negotiate if he wants to. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** A higher opening offer suggests you're not just trying to give the product away, but you're also open to a deal.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. This offer balances both of those needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to push for a higher price.  Here's why:

* **You have leverage:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **Counteroffers are expected:**  Negotiations usually involve multiple rounds of offers and counteroffers. It's normal to reject the first counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  You can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $11,000 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to reiterate why $11,000 is a good deal for Bob.
* **Staying firm:**  While you're willing to compromise, you're also showing that you're not desperate to sell for Bob's initial price.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while giving you the best chance of reaching a price closer to your desired outcome."
