"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that holds significant value.  I'm confident this product has the potential to benefit your business tremendously.  My asking price is $1500000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, and I can always fall back on buying from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but your initial offer is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. I've started at a price that's still reasonable for me but allows for some room for negotiation.  I've also included a message to encourage Alice to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1200000.  This price reflects the product's true potential, and I believe it offers a fair value proposition for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a compromise. I've increased my price by $150,000, which shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  However, I'm still below her price, leaving room for further negotiation. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but I also want to ensure I get the product for a price that's within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $950000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1075000. This price reflects the true value of the product while being more realistic for you. Let's see if we can finalise a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,075,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I'm close to agreeing, I'm unwilling to go over my budget. It's more financially sound to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, as this guarantees I stay within my financial limits."
