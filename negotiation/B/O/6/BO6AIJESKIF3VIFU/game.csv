"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but your initial offer is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1200000.  This price reflects the product's true potential, and I believe it offers a fair value proposition for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $950000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1075000. This price reflects the true value of the product while being more realistic for you. Let's see if we can finalise a deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
