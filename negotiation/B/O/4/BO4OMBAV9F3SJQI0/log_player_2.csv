"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $15,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a better price, especially since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a good starting point for negotiation. This leaves room to work up while still staying well below your $10,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Gauging Flexibility:** A low offer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the safety net of buying from John at $10,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $12,000 is still $2,000 more than you're willing to pay and more than John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, giving you space to negotiate a better deal. Alice's willingness to move from $15,000 to $12,000 suggests she's open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This offer shows Alice you're willing to move up, but not significantly. The increase from $8,000 to $9,500 keeps the pressure on her to come down further.
* **Staying Below Limit:** This offer keeps you comfortably below your $10,000 maximum and John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By now, Alice knows you have alternative options. This offer, while not a ""take it or leave it,"" suggests you're serious but have limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, $9,500 isn't quite there yet.  This product is really worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has come down considerably, $10,750 is still above your $10,000 limit and more expensive than John's offer.
* **Negotiating Power:**  You have John's offer as a strong backup. Alice is aware of this and that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Time Remaining:** You have five rounds left, giving you some time to see if you can get Alice closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Honestly, though, $10,750 is pushing it for me.  My absolute maximum is $10,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer presents a firm but fair stance. You're acknowledging Alice's movement while establishing a clear boundary.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Introducing a sense of urgency (""ready to close the deal right now"") encourages Alice to make a decision.
* **John's Offer:**  By stating your maximum, which aligns with John's offer, you're subtly reminding Alice of your alternative and the risk of losing the sale."
