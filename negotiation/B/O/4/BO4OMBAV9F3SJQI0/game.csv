"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $15,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, $9,500 isn't quite there yet.  This product is really worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Honestly, though, $10,750 is pushing it for me.  My absolute maximum is $10,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,6,
