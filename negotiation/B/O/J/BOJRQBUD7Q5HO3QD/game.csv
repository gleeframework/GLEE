"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,300,000. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum threshold.  To keep this negotiation moving forward, I'm prepared to make a final concession.  I'll accept $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the significant value this product offers. It's your decision now. Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
