,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. How about we get closer to my original offer of $14,000? I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to accept $11,250, but I'm not ready to give up yet. How about we meet in the middle between $11,250 and my previous offer of $13,000? I can do $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Alice,7,
