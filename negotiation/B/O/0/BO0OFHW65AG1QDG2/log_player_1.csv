"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by leaving some room for compromise.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, and me the option to either settle at this price or continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better offer.  I have 8 rounds remaining, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price that's not profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am comfortable paying $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to keep negotiating. My goal is to maximize my profit, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This offer is fair to both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob has shown he's willing to go up to $11,000.  With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming more risky to hold out. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit, and I can always use the extra time to find another buyer for my next product."
