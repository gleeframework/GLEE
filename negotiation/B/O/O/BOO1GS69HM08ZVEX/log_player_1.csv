Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I'm sure you'd be interested in. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product, without revealing my absolute minimum. It also leaves the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **High starting point:** This allows for potential negotiation and hopefully a higher final price.
* **Focus on value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob can increase his perceived value and make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  By stating I'm willing to ""discuss it further,""  I signal flexibility and create an opportunity for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The actual offer and negotiation strategy will depend on factors like your assessment of Bob's financial situation and potential willingness to pay."
