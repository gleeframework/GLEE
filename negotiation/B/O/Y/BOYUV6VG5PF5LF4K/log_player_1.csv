Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $15,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
