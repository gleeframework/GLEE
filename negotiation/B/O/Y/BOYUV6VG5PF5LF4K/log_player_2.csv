Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $14,100.  This is my final offer, as it's only $100 above my minimum.  I believe this is a fair price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's seal the deal!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and it's only $100 more than her stated minimum.  While we might get the price lower, there's a risk she walks away. Accepting at $14,100 secures a good deal, especially since John's alternative is $15,000."
