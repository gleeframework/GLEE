{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit lower, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it for the full $1,200,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This offer ensures you make a substantial profit over your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
