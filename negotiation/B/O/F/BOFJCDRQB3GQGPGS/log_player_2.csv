Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement. Let me propose a price of $9,500 for this exceptional product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that works for both of us. I am willing to consider $9,200 for the product. I hope this price is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price point.  $9,200 is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's offer and closer to Bob's maximum budget. It's worth taking the offer rather than risking further negotiation."
