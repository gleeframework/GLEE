"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal. There are still 9 rounds left, giving you ample time to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a $1,000 reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully encourages her to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a good price, it's still $2,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $7,750. This shows flexibility while still remaining firm in my desire to negotiate a lower price. I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my target price without risking losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,900 is within my acceptable range, and we are now halfway through the rounds. It's likely that continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of missing out on a better deal with John."
