"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  $1,750,000 is a significant markup, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't immediately happy with the price.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a substantial profit.  $1,600,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still low, but he's moving closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,550,000.  This is getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a decent profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting closer to my minimum price, but Bob still isn't quite there. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
