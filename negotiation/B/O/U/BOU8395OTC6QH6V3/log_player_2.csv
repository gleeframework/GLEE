"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice is offering the product for its maximum value to you. There's no point in accepting since you can get the same price from John.  You should try to get Alice to lower her price.
