Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product offers significant value, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I think you'll find this a fair price considering its potential worth."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm setting the price high but still leaving room for Bob to see value. $1,450,000 is a significant profit margin for me and still below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price further, potentially leading to a faster sale.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the opportunity to gain a higher profit than my guaranteed sale to John."
