{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer allows for a good profit margin for you, while still being potentially attractive to Bob as he can potentially make a profit by reselling it.  It leaves room for negotiation and counteroffers, giving you leverage while still trying to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $1,500,000. While you could accept his offer, it's not in your best interest to sell for so much less than you value the product.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially driving the price up closer to your desired amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1,300,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still gives you a solid opportunity for profit."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum desired price, it's still below your ideal value for the product.  Rejecting his offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially a higher price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be profitable for you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save as much as possible, and $1350000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1280000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly less than your desired price.  You've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum price point. Selling to John guarantees you the full value of the product, ensuring a much more profitable outcome."
