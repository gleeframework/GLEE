"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal since the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying close to my target.  This is a good balance to show that I'm serious about selling to Bob while also maintaining a fair price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $9,600 is a good compromise and a significant profit for me. It's also important to remember that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, and further negotiation might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
