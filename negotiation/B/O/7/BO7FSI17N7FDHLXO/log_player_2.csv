Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is your absolute highest offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,500 and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation to potentially save only $500."
