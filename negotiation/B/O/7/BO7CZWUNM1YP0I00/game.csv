,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and provides you with a significant saving compared to my initial offer.  Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the compromise we've already made.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While I value your continued interest, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering $1,025,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
