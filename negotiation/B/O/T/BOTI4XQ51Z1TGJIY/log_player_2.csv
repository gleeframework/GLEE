{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still hoping to get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $12,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. He has tried negotiating for a lower price, but Alice is unwilling to go below $12,500. This is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. Therefore, the best course of action is to buy the product from John for $8,000."
