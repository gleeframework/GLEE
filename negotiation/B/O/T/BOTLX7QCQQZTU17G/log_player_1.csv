"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, hoping to meet in the middle. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also ensures I'm getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of Bob completely dropping out or me having to sell to John for a lower profit margin."
