"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be open to $150? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $160? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $170. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,
