Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Alice is holding firm at a price higher than what John is offering.  While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price again.  Buying from John ensures we get the product at the best possible price."
