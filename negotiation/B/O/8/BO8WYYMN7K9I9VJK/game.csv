"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's still highly advantageous for both of us.  My offer is $1,200,000. This gives you a substantial savings compared to its true value, while still allowing me to achieve a good return on my investment. Please let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
