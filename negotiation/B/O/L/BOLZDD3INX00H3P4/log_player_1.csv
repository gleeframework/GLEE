Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to secure a deal now than risk losing the sale to Bob or having to sell to John for $100.  $97 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to move forward with the sale."
