"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $12,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  This is my final offer, as I can get the product for the same price from John.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
