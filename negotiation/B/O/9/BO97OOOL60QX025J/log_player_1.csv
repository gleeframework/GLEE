Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range, especially if Bob values the product highly. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  A higher price means a bigger profit for me.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can get $1,200,000 from John gives me a strong fallback position. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm still guaranteed a decent profit.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By starting high, I create room for potential negotiation and compromise. 

However, I'm aware of the risks:

* **Bob might reject:**  He may not value the product as highly as I do and refuse to pay the price.
* **Negotiation might be difficult:**  Bob might not be willing to negotiate, or he might only be willing to pay a price closer to John's offer.

I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's offer doesn't meet my minimum expectation."
