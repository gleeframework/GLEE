{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $15,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive tone:** I'm trying to be friendly and build rapport with Bob to encourage him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning that the product is ""unique"" and ""of great value"" to pique Bob's interest.

This is just a starting point. Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy and price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still some room to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:**  This will help me maintain my bargaining power.
* **Potentially get a higher price:**  Bob might be willing to go a bit higher if he thinks I'm serious about my initial price.

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise that's closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm getting fair value for this unique product. How about we split the difference and go with $13,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering at $13,750, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair price.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counter-offer, highlighting the product's uniqueness and the need to cover costs. This makes it more likely that Bob will take my offer seriously.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize that the price is still a ""great deal"" for Bob, making the counter-offer more appealing. 

By using this strategy, I hope to reach a compromise that satisfies both of our needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13750 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is only $800 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher offer from Bob.  

Considering these factors, accepting his offer is the best option:

* **Close to minimum:**  I'm not losing much by accepting.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I keep rejecting, Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with the less desirable option of selling to John for $12,000. 

It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the potential to secure a sale.  In this case, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision."
