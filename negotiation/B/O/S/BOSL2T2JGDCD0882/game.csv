"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, considering my maximum is $8,000. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm ready to pay $9,000 for the product, which would be a fair compromise for both of us. It's a significant step closer to your asking price and within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
