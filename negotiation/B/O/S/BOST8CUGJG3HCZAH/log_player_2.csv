{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 50% reduction from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a clear lower bound."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer to my budget. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal.  We've already established a negotiation range, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a counteroffer at my maximum budget. This is a strategic move. If Alice accepts, I get the product for my desired price. If she rejects, it's time to consider buying from John, as further negotiation might not yield a better outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my preferred budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. There's still a chance that I can reach an agreement with Alice without having to resort to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my maximum budget and Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach an agreement.  If Alice rejects, I'll seriously consider purchasing from John, as we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my preferred budget. It's a bit risky, but I'm going to continue negotiating for one more round to see if we can reach a deal closer to my desired price. If Alice rejects my counteroffer, I'll be ready to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping that Alice is finally willing to meet me halfway.  If she rejects this offer, I will buy from John in the next round. It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, Alice's offer is still too high.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that meets my budget. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John at my pre-determined maximum price of $1,000,000."
