"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth $1,400,000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is below Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob needs to start with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within his budget.  
* **Negotiation Tactic:** A $150,000 difference is a good starting point for negotiation. It's likely Alice won't accept immediately, but it signals Bob's seriousness.
* **Leaving Room:** A lower offer allows room for negotiation in subsequent rounds, giving Bob more leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to reach my minimum target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:** Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  There's room to bargain.
* **John's Offer:** The fact that John is willing to sell for $1,200,000 gives Bob leverage. He knows there's a backup option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob is proposing to meet Alice halfway between her offer and his previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Staying within Budget:**  The offer is still within Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000, but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to finalize the deal, showing a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below my minimum goal.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000 as a final compromise. This gives us both a good deal and allows me to reach my minimum target. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Even though Alice has come down in price, $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:**  There is still room to negotiate further, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **John's Offer:** Bob has a backup option with John, providing leverage. 

Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,325,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  It's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Bob needs to start signaling a potential end to the negotiations,  so declaring this a ""final offer"" adds pressure.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob is offering a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a commitment to compromise.
* **Leaving a Little Room:** While this is technically higher than his ""ideal"" price, there's still room for Alice to budge a bit if she's truly motivated to sell.  He's not completely at his limit."
