"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be extremely valuable to you. I'm looking for a price around $20,000 to let it go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. While it's tempting to take the sure $15,000 from John, there's still room to negotiate with Bob. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a little high, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is getting close. Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, and I'm still above John's offer.  I'll counter one more time to test his flexibility.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $15,500 and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my budget of $14,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob seems firm on his $14,000 limit.  While I could try to push him further, it's getting risky. He's not budging, and I risk losing both his offer and John's guaranteed price.
