"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a little high, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
