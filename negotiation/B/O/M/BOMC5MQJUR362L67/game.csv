"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $9,000? I think that would be a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
