Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. It's clear she's trying to maximize her profit. You can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John, which is within your budget and saves you at least $3,000 compared to continuing negotiations with Alice."
