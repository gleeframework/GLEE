Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the minimum I'd accept ($120), but still a reasonable starting point considering the product's worth to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product within my budget of $120. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the sale and having to settle with John for the same amount."
