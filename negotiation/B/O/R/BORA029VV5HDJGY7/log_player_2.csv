"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $8,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $15,000. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price of $10,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price, but he's recognizing that he might need to compromise a little bit. This counteroffer is a compromise between his ideal price and Alice's latest offer. It gives Alice some room to come down, but it still leaves Bob with a significant saving compared to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on her price, but she's still not close to Bob's ideal price.  At this point, it's likely that Alice is unwilling to go lower. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's the best decision to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a stalemate, wasting time and potentially pushing Alice to a higher price."
