Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $900,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at $900,000 leaves room for negotiation but still presents a significant profit margin for me.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept the offer without excessive haggling."
