{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. I'm also emphasizing that the price is a good deal for both of us, which can help build trust and rapport. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm choosing to start with a higher price than Bob's value. This gives me a starting point for negotiation and allows for potential profit. However, I'm not starting too high to avoid immediately alienating Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by:

* **Securing a higher price than Bob's value:** This means a higher profit for me.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for potential compromise and a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Keeping the option of selling to John:** If Bob rejects my offer or we fail to reach an agreement, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.  

**Reasoning:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because:

* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** Accepting $100 would leave me with a substantial loss compared to my minimum value of $150.
* **I have a guaranteed alternative:** I can sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **There's potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.

I believe rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in a strong position to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $120 is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and expressing appreciation for his participation in the negotiation.  I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the fairness of the offer. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** $120 is closer to my desired price, allowing for a better outcome than Bob's $100 offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, signaling I'm not desperate to sell. This allows for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Encourage a deal:** By being reasonable and highlighting the fairness of the offer, I increase the chances of reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer balances the need to reach a deal with the goal of maximizing my profit, keeping the negotiation moving forward in a positive direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'd like to propose $110 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because:

* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:**  $110 is still too low for me to accept, especially considering I have a guaranteed alternative with John.
* **I have a guaranteed alternative:** I can sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Bob has declared this his ""final offer,"" so further negotiations might be fruitless.

By rejecting this offer, I'm maintaining my position and ensuring I don't settle for a price that is detrimental to my own financial interests. I will now proceed to sell the product to John."

```

**Explanation:**
