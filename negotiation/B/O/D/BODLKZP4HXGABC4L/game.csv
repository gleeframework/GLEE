I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! I think you'll really love it.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $90, which is $105. Would you be willing to meet me there?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $100, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's the lowest I can offer and still make a profit.",100.0,Alice,5,
