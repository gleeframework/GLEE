"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob than $8,000.  The product is worth $10,000 to me, so I'm not going to sell it for less than that.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That seems fair given the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $9000 is a fair price for me either. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting too close to my minimum price, but I'm not going to risk him rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially ending up with nothing. Selling to John for $10,000 is a safer option."
