"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to see the product in your hands, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's keep this negotiation going, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's finalize this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll pay cash upfront, which I think is a big advantage for you. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,6,
