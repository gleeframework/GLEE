Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you at $1,500,000. "", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significantly higher profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide whether to lower the price slightly, potentially meeting in the middle for a final price above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, he may need convincing. Your message should subtly highlight the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Even though John is a guaranteed buyer, having other potential buyers could give you more leverage in negotiations."
