"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $12000. I'm willing to consider a price of $16000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14000, which is still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider selling the product to me for $13500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
