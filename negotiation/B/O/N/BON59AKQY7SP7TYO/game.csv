"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $160? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $130?  That's a fair price and closer to what I had in mind.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. How about we try $145? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
