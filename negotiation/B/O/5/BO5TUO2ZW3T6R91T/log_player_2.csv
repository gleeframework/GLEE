Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,125,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
