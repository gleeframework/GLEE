"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly bridge the gap between Alice's offer and his desired price.  A $120 offer is a substantial reduction from Alice's $140, showing Bob's seriousness about securing a good deal. This also provides a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price. With 7 rounds remaining, there is still ample time to explore further price reductions. Bob wants to see if Alice is willing to come down to $125 or even closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, indicating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable price. This slight increase shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal but isn't willing to overpay. This could potentially encourage Alice to accept the offer, given it's closer to her desired price."
