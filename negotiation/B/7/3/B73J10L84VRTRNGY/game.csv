"I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $140?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $145 is still a bit low for me, but I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. Would you be willing to go as low as $142?",142.0,Bob,6,
