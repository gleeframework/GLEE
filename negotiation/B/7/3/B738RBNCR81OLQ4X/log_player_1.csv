"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium, and sets the stage for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I would be happy to sell to John for $800,000, I believe I can get more from Bob.  I will counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm counteroffering again with a price closer to Bob's latest offer.  This shows flexibility and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal with him.  I'm confident that we can agree on a price within a few more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations are taking longer than I expected and I'm concerned I may not be able to close a deal with Bob at a price that meets my minimum.  While I would prefer to get more, selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed profit and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation."
