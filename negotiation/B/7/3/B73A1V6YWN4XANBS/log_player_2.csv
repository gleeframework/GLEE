"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  That's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. While she tries to convince you it's worth $120 to you, you know your budget and John offers a better deal."
