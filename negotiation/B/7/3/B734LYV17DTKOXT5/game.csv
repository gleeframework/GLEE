"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking that the product's value to me is still significant, and I'd like to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1350000 for it. How about we meet at $1320000?",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too close to your initial offer. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $1320000 for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about we aim for $1315000?",1315000.0,Alice,5,
