(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, there's no guarantee that she'll continue to lower the price. John is offering the product at my exact budget, so it makes more sense to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
