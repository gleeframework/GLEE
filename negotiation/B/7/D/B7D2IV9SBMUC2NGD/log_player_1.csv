I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the features and benefits you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted by the $12,000 offer, it's my minimum price and I believe I can potentially get more. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly better than my minimum of $12,000 and closer to my desired price.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
