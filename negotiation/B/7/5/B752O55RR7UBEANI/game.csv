,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $107.50 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $108.75. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $106.50. That's my final offer. Can you consider it?",106.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm only willing to go down to $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to keep going back and forth. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",107.5,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $106.75. That's my final offer. Can you consider it?",106.75,Bob,8,
