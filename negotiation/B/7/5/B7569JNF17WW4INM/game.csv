"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  While the product looks interesting,  $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $120.  I think this is a fair price that's good for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I'll meet you at $123. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",123.0,Alice,5,
