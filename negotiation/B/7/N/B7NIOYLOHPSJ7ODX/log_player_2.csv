"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. I believe this price reflects the immense worth it will bring to your endeavors. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value:** Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, but is offering it to Bob for $950,000. This means there is room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is your maximum:** You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so John's offer is your ceiling.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price without losing out entirely. 

This strategy aims to maximize Bob's potential savings while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend less.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her valuation. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a better deal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This counter-offer leaves space for further negotiations if Alice rejects.
* **Avoids immediate rejection:** It's likely that Alice will consider this offer, as it's closer to her own value than her initial asking price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment.  Would you consider $910,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's more room for negotiation. 
* **Counter-offering increases chances of a better deal:**  By rejecting and counter-offering, Bob can potentially push the price even lower. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Bob has the option to go to John if the negotiation fails, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting Alice's offer."

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's last offer ($910,000) and Bob's previous offer ($875,000).  
* **Shows commitment:**  By offering a price closer to Alice's, Bob demonstrates he's serious about buying the product, increasing the chances of a deal. 
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice and provides her with an incentive to respond."
