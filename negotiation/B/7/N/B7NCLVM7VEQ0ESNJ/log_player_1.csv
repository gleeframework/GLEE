Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can do better. I'll try to get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will benefit both of us. "", ""product_price"": 950000}

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $925,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to my target of $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the sale than risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer."
