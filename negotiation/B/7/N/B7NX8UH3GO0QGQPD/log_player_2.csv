"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $95? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, her ""final offer"" of $95 is still significantly more than John's offer of $80.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to close the gap enough to make it worthwhile."
