Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* By offering a higher price, I am hoping to maximize my profits. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price, so there's no risk involved in making a higher offer. 
* The key is to find a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
