"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer represents a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
