Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's value for the product while still allowing me a profit. I believe this price is reasonable and could lead to a successful deal."
