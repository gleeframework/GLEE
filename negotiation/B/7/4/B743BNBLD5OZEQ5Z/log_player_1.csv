"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I believe it's a good starting point to gauge his interest.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway or come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,550,000. This is a significant move down from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer. I believe it's a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, while still getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not quite ready to sell to John for $1,500,000 yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll try to counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000. This is a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still above Bob's last offer. With 5 rounds remaining, I think there's still room to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 4 more rounds to negotiate.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000.  This is a slight drop from my previous offer, but it's a strategic move. I'm acknowledging that I'm getting closer to Bob's price point, but also demonstrating that I'm not willing to go much lower. With only 3 rounds left, I'm hoping this will push Bob to consider a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum. While I could try to counteroffer again, the risk of a final rejection is high.  At this point, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation.  It's a safer option considering the limited time."
