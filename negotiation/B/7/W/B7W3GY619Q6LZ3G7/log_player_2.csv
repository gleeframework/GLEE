"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're starting our negotiations at $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider something closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  Maintains a positive tone in the negotiation.
* **Anchors low:**  Starting at $80 aims to establish a lower range for the negotiation, even though we know Alice values the product higher.
* **Direct and clear:**  States the desired price directly without being overly aggressive. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. Considering your budget, how about we meet in the middle at $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly above her value of $80.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $85?  That feels like a good compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental progress:** We're nudging the price down slowly, showing willingness to compromise but not conceding too much at once. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason (""good compromise"") can make the counter-offer feel more reasonable.
* **Maintaining politeness:** We want to keep the tone positive to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
