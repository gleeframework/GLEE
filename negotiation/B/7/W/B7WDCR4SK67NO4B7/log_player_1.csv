"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $19,000? It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll reap."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going above $12,000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to the product's real worth.  How about we compromise at $17,000? That's me coming down significantly to try and make this work."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has consistently shown a ceiling in his offers. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase from $13,000, especially when he stated it was his ""absolute limit."" Accepting further counteroffers risks missing out on John's guaranteed $15,000. It's time to secure the guaranteed profit."
