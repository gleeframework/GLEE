"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, still leaving a profit margin for Alice while saving Bob some money. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,700? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. $13,700 is still above Alice's value for the product ($12,000), and Bob can likely get a better deal. Rejecting allows Bob to continue haggling and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit high. How about $13,500? I'm really interested in this product and think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money. While $13,500 is still slightly more than Alice's value, it's a reasonable compromise.  This counteroffer shows Bob is flexible but still firm in his desire to get a good price. It also positions him for a potential final round negotiation if Alice rejects again."
