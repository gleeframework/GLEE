"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $800,000. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you meet me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Let's split the difference and agree on $950,000. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
