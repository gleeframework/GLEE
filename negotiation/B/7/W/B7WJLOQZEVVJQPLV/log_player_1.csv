"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might consider (given his valuation of $100). 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's benefits for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid,  indicating that I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can still negotiate and potentially get a higher price from Bob.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While selling to John for $150 is an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and aiming to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still gives me a good price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $175 to $140, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight value:** I emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While lowering the price, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me room to bargain further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation ongoing:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I want to see if I can push him further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm willing to risk one more round to potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final compromise, offering a price just above my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm using persuasive language to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal.
* **Balancing risk:** While selling to John for $150 is safe, I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're now at round 6, and I only have four rounds left to reach a deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 ensures a profit and avoids further negotiation that could lead to an unfavorable outcome.

While I would like to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high given my limited rounds and the fact that his offer is far below my minimum.  It's better to guarantee a profit by selling to John."
