"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000, which is a fair compromise between our estimated values.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given our respective valuations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1350000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This offer represents a significant investment for me and is closer to my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to reach your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1325000.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1325000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, considering my budget. I'm willing to offer $1300000 again. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1315000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
