This is a very high starting price from Alice. It's worth seeing if she'll come down a bit before considering the alternative of buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

$11,000 is still too high.  I'll try to get Alice closer to my target before buying from John."
