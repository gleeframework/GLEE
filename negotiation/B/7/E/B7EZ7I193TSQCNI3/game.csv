,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm not willing to pay more than $10750. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to look elsewhere. I think I'll go talk to John about buying the product from him for $8000.",10750.0,Bob,10,
