,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $120. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
