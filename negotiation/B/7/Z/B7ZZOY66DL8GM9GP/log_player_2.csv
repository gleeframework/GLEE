"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 8250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit above my maximum budget.  While I'm getting closer, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth a few more rounds to see if I can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $8,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $8,000 - that's my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my budget maximum of $8,000. This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about buying but also emphasizes that I'm not willing to go higher. Hopefully, Alice will accept to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable selling at 8000. How about we meet at 8100? That's the lowest I can go, but it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit above my maximum budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's getting close to the end of our rounds.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially not reaching a deal, I'm going to buy the product from John at $8,000. This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids any further haggling."
