"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** A counteroffer of $850,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum of $800,000. 
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while also indicating he's willing to negotiate.
* **Setting a clear price:**  This counteroffer makes a concrete price proposal, giving Alice a clear point to respond to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $875,000 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than his initial maximum of $1,000,000 and is a good compromise.
* **Time is Valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rounds and potentially a higher price. It's more efficient to accept this offer, especially considering the risk of Alice changing her mind in future rounds."
