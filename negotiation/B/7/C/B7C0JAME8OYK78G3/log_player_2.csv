Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the best price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He has already shown he's willing to pay more than $1,250,000, but there's room to bargain for a price closer to that amount."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,300,000. I'll offer the product to you for $1,325,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other buyers.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.  Accepting saves Bob $175,000 compared to buying from John, and is still within his budget.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might walk away and he'd have to buy from John at a higher price."
