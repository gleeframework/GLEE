Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the higher price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies a willingness to discuss the price, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable figure above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a fair deal."
