Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 170}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and he's making a counteroffer of $150. Since $150 is the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product, I think I'll accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $150.
