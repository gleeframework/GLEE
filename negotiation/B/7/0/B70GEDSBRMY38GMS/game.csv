"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to consider it?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $110? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? I think it's a fair price considering the market value, and I'm willing to commit to buying the product if you're willing to meet me at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",115.0,Alice,5,
