"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can meet him halfway.  There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,750 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. While I'd prefer more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids further negotiations."
