"Thanks for the offer Alice,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
