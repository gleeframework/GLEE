Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,300,000 is simply not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.
