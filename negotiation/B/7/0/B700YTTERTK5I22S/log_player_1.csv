"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** The price is still within a range that Bob might consider, especially if he truly wants the product. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation with a friendly tone. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize Profit:**  By starting high, I have a better chance of achieving a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response will give me valuable information about his level of interest and his negotiation style.
* **Avoid John Immediately:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** I'm comfortable with John's offer, but I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price just yet. 

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counter offer is still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant compromise from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to give up too much.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.  

**Why this approach?**

* **Increase Chances of Agreement:**  By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept.
* **Gaining Momentum:**  Moving closer to Bob's offer shows flexibility and builds momentum towards a deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The price remains above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing Opportunity:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 would guarantee my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob if I continue to negotiate.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I'm still hopeful that we can find a price that works for both of us, but I need to hold firm on my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value but still above my minimum acceptable value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,300,000 is simply not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. This is my final offer, and it's a price that will ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair Counter:**  I'm holding firm on my minimum, but I'm also making a slight compromise by coming down to $1,550,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. This approach can be effective in persuading a buyer to close the deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to justify my offer.

**Why this approach?**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  By staying above my minimum, I'm avoiding a potentially unfavorable deal.
* **Pressuring Acceptance:**  This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency and increases the likelihood that Bob will accept to avoid potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Even though I'm compromising, I'm still holding leverage by making it clear that this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,300,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate, wasting valuable time and potentially jeopardizing the deal.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum, which is essential given the risks associated with further negotiations with Bob.

**Why this approach?**

* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I prefer to get a higher price, selling to John ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money.
* **Avoiding Delay:**  Further negotiation with Bob could delay the sale and potentially lead to a worse outcome.
* **Protecting My Interests:**  John's offer provides a safe and secure way to finalize the sale and avoid any potential risks associated with further negotiation with Bob."
