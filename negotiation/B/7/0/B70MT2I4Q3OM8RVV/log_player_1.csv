Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
