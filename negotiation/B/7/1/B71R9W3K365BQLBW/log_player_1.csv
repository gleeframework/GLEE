{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is closer to my minimum value than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It also allows me to gauge his level of interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not yet ready to settle for it. I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still a bit lower than where I'd like to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,150? That would be a fair compromise, and I think it still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $8,900? That would be a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and it's likely that if I reject this offer, he will either drop out of the negotiation or try to lower his offer further. It's better to take the $8,900 and secure the sale than risk losing the deal altogether."
