"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell the product to you for $13500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. He's able to get the product for less than John's price and still save $1,500 compared to his initial budget. It's a good compromise, and there's a risk of losing the deal if he keeps pushing for a lower price."
