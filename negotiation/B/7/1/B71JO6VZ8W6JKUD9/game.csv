"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and $900,000 is a good starting point. However, considering the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves a considerable profit for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about securing this product.  While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit off on that price. Let's meet in the middle:  $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value and gives you a solid profit margin.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this point.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $875,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on this product. I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,8,
