"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you at that price, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good starting point, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is still significantly above my minimum of $800,000, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and confident, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  $900,000 is still a decent amount, but I believe I can push for a higher price.  Bob acknowledges the product's value, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still holding a strong position. 
* **Not selling to John yet:**  While John's offer is a safe fallback, I want to see if I can secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and $900,000 is a good starting point. However, considering the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves a considerable profit for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility, but still staying well above my minimum and John's offer.
* **Highlighting Bob's benefit:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, subtly reminding him of the good deal he's getting at this price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive, collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied with the price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer that might secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not desperate to sell and can rely on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about securing this product.  While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit off on that price. Let's meet in the middle:  $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value and gives you a solid profit margin.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasis on value and profit:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the profit he'll still make at this price. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using positive language like ""finalize a deal"" to suggest a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but I believe there's still room for a small increase. I'm not desperate to sell yet and want to see if I can secure a slightly better price. 
* **John's offer is a safe fallback:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that is closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $875,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on this product. I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm making a small concession, but still staying above John's offer, showing my willingness to compromise while maintaining a good profit.
* **Emphasize the value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him to encourage him to accept. 
* **Urgency and finality:**  The phrase ""final concession"" adds a sense of urgency and implies that this is my best offer.  
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" and ""finalize the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is now my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. There's no further room to negotiate.
* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high. 
* **Safe and secure:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price.  It's a sure thing, eliminating the risk of ending up with no deal at all.

While it's frustrating to not get a higher price, securing my minimum with John is the most prudent strategy at this point."
