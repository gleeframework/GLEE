"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,400,000 is significantly below what I can consider. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of this product.  What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
