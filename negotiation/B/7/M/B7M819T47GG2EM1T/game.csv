"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $75?  That's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can do $90, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $90 is closer but still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  This is my final offer, let's make this deal happen.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $95. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",95.0,Alice,7,
