"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential benefits. I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest and the value you see in our product, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure fairness in the transaction, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This reflects a compromise between our original prices, taking into account both the value of the product and your budget constraints. I am hopeful that we can find a solution that satisfies both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair middle ground that accounts for both our respective valuations. This offer reflects my commitment to closing a deal, but it's my final offer in this range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to move closer to your proposal. In light of our ongoing discussions, I would like to suggest a price of $1,025,000. This represents a reduction from my initial asking price and a compromise from your last offer. I hope this proposal will help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
