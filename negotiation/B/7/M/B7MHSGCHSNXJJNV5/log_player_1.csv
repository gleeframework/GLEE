Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair middle ground that accounts for both our respective valuations. This offer reflects my commitment to closing a deal, but it's my final offer in this range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
