"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and meeting me partway.  While $2,300,000 represents the top end of this product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
