"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $88? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my ideal price,  it's only $1 away from my minimum and getting closer to the end of the rounds. It's not worth risking losing the sale to John for just $1."
