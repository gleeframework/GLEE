"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the inherent value and represents a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget.  Would you consider $1,250,000? I feel this is a fair price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to increase your offer is encouraging, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair deal.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm targeting $1,550,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm open to discussing flexible payment terms if that would be helpful.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer and for considering some flexibility. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,550,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
