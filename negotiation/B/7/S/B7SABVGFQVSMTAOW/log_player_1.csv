"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exceptional value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point for our discussion,"" I signal that I'm open to negotiation and willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's too early to settle for my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the inherent value and represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection and Justification:** I politely reject Bob's initial offer, emphasizing that it doesn't reflect the product's true value. This maintains a firm stance while keeping the negotiation open.
* **Significant Drop:** By dropping the price by $300,000, I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his range.
* **Framing as Compromise:** Presenting the new price as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to view it more favorably. 

The goal is to find a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget.  Would you consider $1,250,000? I feel this is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now exceeding his perceived value of the product, indicating a strong interest. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a better price, especially with more rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to increase your offer is encouraging, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair deal.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm targeting $1,550,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm open to discussing flexible payment terms if that would be helpful."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement and Encouragement:** I start by acknowledging Bob's upward movement in price and his commitment to the negotiation. This maintains a positive tone and encourages further progress.
* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm holding firm above my $1,500,000 minimum but offering a smaller price reduction ($150,000) to show I'm willing to meet Bob partway.
* **Value Emphasis and Alternative Solution:** I reiterate the product's value and introduce the possibility of flexible payment terms as an added incentive. This could make the deal more attractive to Bob without significantly impacting the final price.

The aim is to nudge Bob closer to my target price while keeping the negotiation moving forward constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer and for considering some flexibility. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,550,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** $1,375,000 is a strong offer, exceeding both Bob's perceived value and my minimum by a significant margin. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of Bob walking away increases if I continue to push for a higher price.
* **Deal Momentum:** Bob's message conveys a strong desire to close the deal. Accepting this offer capitalizes on this momentum and minimizes the chance of the negotiation stalling. 

While I could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer ($1,500,000) is too great. Accepting $1,375,000 secures a substantial profit and a successful outcome."
