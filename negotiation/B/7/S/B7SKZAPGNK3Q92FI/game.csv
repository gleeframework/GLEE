"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this investment.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about making a profit on this investment. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $950000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'm thinking of $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to be more aggressive, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'm thinking of $875000 again, but this time I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it. I'm also considering buying from John at $1000000, so I'm giving you a final chance to meet me at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to sell my services to you at $875000, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1200000.",875000.0,Bob,6,
