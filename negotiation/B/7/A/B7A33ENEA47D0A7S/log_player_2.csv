"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll be happy with this price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,500,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000.  While Alice's offer is still above her valuation of the product ($1,000,000), Bob is still getting a good deal by accepting."
