"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering how much you'll benefit from having it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. I think that's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in accepting.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
