"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider $10500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $11000?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10750?  I'm confident this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",10750.0,Bob,4,
