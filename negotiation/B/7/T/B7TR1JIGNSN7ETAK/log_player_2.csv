"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, I can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's no harm in rejecting the initial offer and seeing if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 1/3 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and  hopefully encourages Alice to come down to a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is still a decent price, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get it closer to my desired range.  There's still room for a counteroffer, and I'm not desperate enough to jump at this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still looking for a good deal.  I'm hoping she'll see the value in closing the deal at this price, avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now just $2 away from my counteroffer.  It's likely I won't get a better price than this.  There's a good chance she won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate risks ending up with no deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price.  $82 is within my budget and a good deal considering the initial asking price."
