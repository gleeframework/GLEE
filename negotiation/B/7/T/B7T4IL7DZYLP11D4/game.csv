"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 is more reflective of that.  Let me know if this price works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on this product, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $987,500. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and it allows us to both walk away with a win.",987500.0,Bob,6,
