We're down to the wire with only two rounds left.  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but there's no guarantee he'll budge further.  I'm not confident I can get a higher price in these last two rounds.  To avoid risking a deal falling through completely, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose out on the minimum value of the product."
