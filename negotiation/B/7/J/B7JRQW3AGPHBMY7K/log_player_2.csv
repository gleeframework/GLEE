"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
