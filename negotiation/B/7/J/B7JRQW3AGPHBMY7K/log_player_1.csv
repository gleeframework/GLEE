{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000:
    * Presents a substantial profit margin for me.
    * Offers Bob a potential $300,000 gain if he leverages the product effectively. 
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** It's essential to consider that Bob might counter-offer. I'm prepared to negotiate slightly but remain firm on not going below a certain threshold to ensure a worthwhile profit.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a backup guarantees I won't be left without a buyer and provides leverage during negotiations with Bob."
