Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.
