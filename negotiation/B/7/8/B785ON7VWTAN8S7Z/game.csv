"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",999000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product, which reflects the value I see in it and is a fair offer for both of us.  I believe this is a good middle ground and a great opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
