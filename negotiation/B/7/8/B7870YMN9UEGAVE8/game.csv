"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to $80.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make the purchase.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $95. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",95.0,Alice,5,
