Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,750. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice is signaling this is her final offer and it's a reasonable compromise, saving you $750 off her previous offer.  While you could get it for $10,000 from John, further negotiation with Alice might not be fruitful and you risk her withdrawing the offer entirely."
