Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off.  Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a very fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum threshold without several more rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John for $800,000 is the safer option and ensures I don't lose potential profit by continuing a protracted negotiation."
