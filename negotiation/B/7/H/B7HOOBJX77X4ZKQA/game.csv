"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I can meet you at $11,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
