"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for me. I was thinking of offering $105 for it. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle again, how about $109?  That way we both get a good deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still think $109 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",108.0,Bob,6,
