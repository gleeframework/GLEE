,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  That's still a great deal considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
