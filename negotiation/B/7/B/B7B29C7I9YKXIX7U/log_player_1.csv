``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good deal but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get at least my minimum price of $100, but aiming higher!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $100, I'm going to try and get closer to my initial ask.  I'll counter with a lower price than my original offer, but still above $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum price.  Hopefully, Bob will find this acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. While it's not my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum and a good deal. I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's $100 offer."
