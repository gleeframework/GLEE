"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,600,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I appreciate your valuation of the product, I must respectfully decline the $1,500,000 proposal. My maximum budget remains at $1,400,000. However, I am open to discussing further if there's any flexibility in your pricing.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
