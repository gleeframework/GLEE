"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it can be even more valuable in the right hands.  To start, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. Considering its potential and my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a sure thing. However, I believe this product holds more value than that. I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price that recognizes your needs while still allowing me to achieve my goals.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. This amount reflects both the value I see in the product and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum goal of $1,000,000. However, I'm still not satisfied with the price. There are still rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm confident this product has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a small step up but will bridge the gap between our expectations.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. After further reflection, I would like to propose a price of $1075000 for the product. This amount aims to find a balance between acknowledging the product's potential value and adhering to my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum goal of $1,000,000, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since I'm still within the first half of the rounds. I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,075,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to give you one more chance to close the deal at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What's your final decision?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for pushing the boundaries. I've considered your final offer carefully, and I'm willing to go up to $1087500 for the product. This amount is a reasonable compromise considering the product's potential value and my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at round 8, meaning only two rounds remain.  Bob's offer is now above the $1,000,000 I would get from John. While I would ideally prefer a higher price, the risk of further negotiation is too high at this stage. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I sell the product at a price that meets my minimum goal and allows me to avoid the potential of losing a sale entirely."
