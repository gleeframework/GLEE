"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident the product's value warrants a higher price. How about $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,3,
