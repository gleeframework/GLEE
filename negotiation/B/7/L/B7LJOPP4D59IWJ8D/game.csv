"Alice, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a little higher than I can manage right now.  Would you be willing to consider $9000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the highest I can offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
