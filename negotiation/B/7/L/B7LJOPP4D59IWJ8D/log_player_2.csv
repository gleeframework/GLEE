Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step down from $12,000, it's still above his $8,000 limit. He should try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a little higher than I can manage right now.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above his budget, and he has only a limited number of rounds to negotiate. It's better to secure the product from John at his maximum price than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
