Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more. 
* **High but Negotiable:** $14,999 is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency:** By emphasizing the ""competitive price"" and not mentioning John, I create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob without pushing him away completely, knowing I have a secure backup offer."
