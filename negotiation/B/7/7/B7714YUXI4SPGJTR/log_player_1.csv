Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range for a potential deal. This strategy allows for further negotiation while keeping the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring further negotiation before settling for a price that doesn't meet my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer offers a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
