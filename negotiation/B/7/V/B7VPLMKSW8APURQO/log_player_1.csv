Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to offer $9,500. This would allow me to stay within my budget and still be a fair price for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
