"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to offer $9,500. This would allow me to stay within my budget and still be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,800 is closer, but unfortunately, I still can't go that high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $10,200. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
