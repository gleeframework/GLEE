"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no immediate need to accept or buy from John.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to offer $9,500. This would allow me to stay within my budget and still be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your budget of $10,000.
* You have 7 rounds remaining (10 total - 3 used).
* It's still worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a price closer to your target.
* If Alice rejects your next counteroffer, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,800 is closer, but unfortunately, I still can't go that high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $10,200. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your budget of $10,000.
* You have 5 rounds remaining, but Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly. 
*  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's the most financially sound choice. There's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a better price within your budget, and you risk losing time."
