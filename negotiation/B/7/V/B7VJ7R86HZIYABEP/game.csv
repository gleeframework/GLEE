"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great price for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? That's the closest I can go to your previous offer",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  $112.50 is still a bit below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle one more time at $113.75. This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go to your price.  Let me know if you're interested.",113.75,Alice,5,
