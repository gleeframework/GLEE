{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer while still having a chance of closing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great price for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? That's the closest I can go to your previous offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $112.5 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more time to reach a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  $112.50 is still a bit below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle one more time at $113.75. This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go to your price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 113.75}
