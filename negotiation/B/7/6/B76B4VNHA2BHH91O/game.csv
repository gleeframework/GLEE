"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's inherent worth. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a significant way off from what I'm willing to accept. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price of $2,100,000 reflects that more accurately.  I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, so let me know your thoughts.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
