"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $11,000 is higher than her product valuation, it's still less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and the price John offers. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000."
