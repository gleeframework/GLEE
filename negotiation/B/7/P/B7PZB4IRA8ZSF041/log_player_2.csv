It's always a good idea to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. In this case, Alice is already offering a good price, but there's no harm in seeing if you can get an even better deal."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

``` 
 
Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a good price considering our goal is to save as much as possible. There's a risk in continuing to negotiate, as we might not get a better offer and end up losing time. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
