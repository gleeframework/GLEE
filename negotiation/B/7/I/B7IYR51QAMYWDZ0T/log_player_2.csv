Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his budget and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering or going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer is still too high. While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Bob can either try to negotiate further or go with John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
