Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but I can't go much lower.  Would you be willing to do $95?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John for $80."
