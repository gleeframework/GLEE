"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer of $100 is above her value of $80, so she's likely to negotiate further.
* There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'm offering a price lower than Alice's initial offer.
* $90 is still a good deal for Alice as it's above her value of $80.
* This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $95, which is still above her value but closer to my desired price.
* I'm willing to pay up to $120, so accepting this offer is a good deal.
* Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Alice rejecting my counteroffer again, and then I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
