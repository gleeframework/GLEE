Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its true value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum acceptable value and Bob's perceived value. This price is likely to spark his interest and encourage him to negotiate further.
* I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to sell for that amount yet.  I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum value while still being realistic and open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential we have to work together.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:**  I'm staying positive and reiterating the value of the product while highlighting the possibility of a mutually beneficial partnership. 

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm trying to find a price point that's more appealing to Bob while still maintaining my own financial goals. 
*  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a long-term relationship, hoping to persuade Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $950,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product and the potential for a positive working relationship. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While I would prefer to get closer to that number, I am confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the future if this partnership is fruitful.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting the offer allows me to move forward with a sale and secure some income.  There's a chance I could get a higher price in the future, but there's also a risk that Bob might not be interested in future negotiations or that I might not find another buyer who is willing to pay more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale.  I'll use this opportunity to build a strong relationship with Bob and see if I can leverage that for better deals in the future."
