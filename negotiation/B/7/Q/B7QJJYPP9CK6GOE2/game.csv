"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you letting me know about this product. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference was a great idea. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to go slightly above that to $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to where I want to be, but $108 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $103?  This is my final offer, as I'm really looking for this product and I'm also considering John's offer of $100.",103.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $103. I'm willing to meet you at $107, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering John's offer of $100.",107.0,Alice,7,
