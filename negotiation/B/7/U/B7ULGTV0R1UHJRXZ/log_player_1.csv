"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, I can still do better. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum price, and considering he stated it's his final offer, it's likely he won't go higher.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
