"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but could you do it for closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hmm, $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $110, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Alice,5,
