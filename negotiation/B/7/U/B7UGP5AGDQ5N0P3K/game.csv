"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is a significant offer, it's still below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's potential and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
