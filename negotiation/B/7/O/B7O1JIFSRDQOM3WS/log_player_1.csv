Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, which is important to keep Bob engaged. 

By starting with a higher price and framing the offer as a good deal, I hope to get Bob to either accept or counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially get closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John would result in the same profit."
