"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own value for it. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get closer to our desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,075,000 just isn't quite there for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a win-win situation. Let's close this deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,087,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,070,000.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",1070000.0,Bob,6,
