I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This price takes into account the value you've placed on it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product and the value you've placed on it.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
