# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can potentially get a better deal than $1,100,000, especially since you know the product is worth less to her."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This price takes into account the value you've placed on it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You know the product is worth less to her than your maximum price, so you can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
