"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1750000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1400000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm proposing $1550000. This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1550000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1450000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This is my final offer, as it's the lowest price I can accept while still covering my costs. It's a fair price considering the product's unique value and potential for your business. Let me know if you're able to accept.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
