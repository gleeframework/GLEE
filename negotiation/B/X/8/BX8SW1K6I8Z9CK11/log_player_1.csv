Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $750,000 is simply not a viable option for me.

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. While I'm willing to compromise, $900,000 is still too low for me.

I'm open to your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I've already made significant concessions, and it's unlikely he'll budge further.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John to ensure I don't lose out on a good deal."
