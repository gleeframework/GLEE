"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even your upper limit of what the product is worth to you. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

We're starting with a low offer here to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's far below both Alice's valuation and our maximum price, but it opens the door for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $115 is still above your maximum budget. You should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we try $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're moving closer to our maximum budget, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This offer attempts to find a middle ground that could be agreeable to both parties."
