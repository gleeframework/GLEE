"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of a high-value product. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly stating why the price is so high. This encourages Bob to engage and potentially reveal more about his valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to discuss the price further, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to consider my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's still significantly below your minimum. We have ample rounds left to negotiate and potentially close a deal closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations. However,  $1,500,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Bob's budget concern to show we're listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:** We stand firm that his offer is too low but counter with a significant drop from our initial price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The ""meet in the middle"" approach aims to find common ground and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counter offer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which suggests he's willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Bob will move closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We start with a positive note, acknowledging Bob's efforts in the negotiation. 
* **Smaller Concession:**  We decrease our counteroffer by a smaller amount ($100,000) than Bob's last increase. This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to seriously consider the deal without further haggling. 
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value to subtly reinforce our position without being overly aggressive. 

We're getting closer to the point where we might need to consider John's offer if Bob doesn't meet us closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,800,000, so how about $1,700,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Factor:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. While we have time, prolonging might not yield significantly better results.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has declared this his final offer, increasing the pressure on our side.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing might lead to smaller concessions from Bob, making the potential gain from further negotiation less appealing. 
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,700,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price and considerably more than John's offer.

While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher if we continue, accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
