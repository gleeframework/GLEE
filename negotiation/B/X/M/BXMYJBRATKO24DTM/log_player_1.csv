Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe I can't pay more than $10,000 for it. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still not able to pay more than $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to lower your price to match my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer.  Since I have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, it makes the most sense to move on and sell to John. It avoids further negotiation and potential stalemates."
