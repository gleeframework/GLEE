"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, you can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

This is a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what you're willing to pay. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it allows for flexibility in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to get the best deal possible. Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than her initial offer, but it's still above your desired price point. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and try to get closer to your target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

You're moving closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, especially since Alice has already lowered her price.  This maintains the negotiation momentum and demonstrates your desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is very close to your maximum of $8,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers or you could run out of rounds.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's only slightly above your limit, and it saves time and potential further negotiation headaches."
