"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to potentially move down a bit later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price closer to the value of the product. How about $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a higher price.  While $16,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I initially hoped for, and I have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussion. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal of $16,000. It's a fair price given the current market conditions and the value this product holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $16,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,250? This would be a good compromise and allow us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, I am unable to move from my original offer of $16,000. I hope we can find a way to agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price, I've reached the point where it's likely Bob won't budge further.  Selling to Bob for $16,000 is a good outcome and allows me to secure a profit while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
