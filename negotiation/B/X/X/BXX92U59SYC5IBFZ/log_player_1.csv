Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible without risking a rejection. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it for $119 leaves Bob with a small gain ($1) which makes it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can still sell it to John for our minimum acceptable price ($100)."
