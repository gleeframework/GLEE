"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider taking $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good margin. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be feasible?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,
