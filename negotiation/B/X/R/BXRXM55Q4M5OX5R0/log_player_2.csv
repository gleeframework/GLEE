"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $115? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let me know your thoughts.
