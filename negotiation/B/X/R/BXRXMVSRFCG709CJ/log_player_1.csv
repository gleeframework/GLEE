"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point to maximize my potential profit.
* **Addressing value:** I'm acknowledging the product's value to Bob in the message to encourage a positive response.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by not starting at my absolute maximum price.

**Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds and can still make counteroffers.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and negotiate a higher price. 

**Note:** While I could sell to John now,  there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still allows for a good margin for you while ensuring I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is slightly lower:** I'm lowering my price to $9,500, which is a compromise from my previous offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value and profit:** I'm reminding Bob of the value to him and highlighting the potential profit he'll still gain.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** This message demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate while still holding firm on my bottom line.

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $8250. This is my final offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $8,250 is still below my desired price point.
* **Potential for better outcome:** I have more rounds left and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but there's a chance I can do better with Bob.

**Note:**  I'm aware that I'm taking a risk by continuing to negotiate, but the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the guaranteed $8,000 from John at this point.  I'll continue to assess the situation and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,750, which is closer to your offer and a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $8,750, a smaller step down from my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also still value the product.
* **Emphasis on closure:**  I'm highlighting the potential for a deal and encouraging Bob to accept this offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage a favorable outcome.

**Note:** I'm getting closer to my minimum price point and approaching the halfway point of negotiations.  I'm confident I can reach a good deal with Bob or fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $8200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get slightly more. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a better offer is increasing.  However, the potential gain of $200 is worth the gamble.
* **Bob's urgency:** Bob mentioning John's offer creates a sense of urgency, but I'm not swayed yet. I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially accepting his offer or moving on to John. 

**Note:** I'm carefully evaluating the risk versus reward of each decision. While selling to John is a safe option, I believe a slightly higher price is still possible with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,200 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $8,400. This is my final offer. If you're still not comfortable with that price, I'll have to consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time."", ""product_price"": 8400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Small compromise:**  I'm increasing my offer by $200 to show I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm on my price.
* **Mentioning John:**  I'm reminding Bob of the alternative, subtly putting pressure on him to accept my offer.

**Note:** I'm now at the end of the negotiation. I have two more rounds to either close a deal with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed price.  I'll assess Bob's response and make my final decision based on the potential outcome."
