"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has a maximum budget of $1,000,000 and knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for less than $900,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While there's no guarantee of a better price, rejecting doesn't obligate Bob to buy. He can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $900,000, but still above the product's value to Alice.  This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Reasonable price:**  $875,000 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget of $1,000,000 and the product's value of $800,000 to Alice.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice becoming unwilling to sell or Bob losing time and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and move on to other opportunities."
