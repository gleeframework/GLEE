"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, I can't accept anything less than $1,750,000 for this product. It holds significant value that goes beyond its immediate potential. I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment at this price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,750,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair compromise. This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
