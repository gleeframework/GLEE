"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 offer:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a friendly and encouraging way to increase the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to make the price seem more appealing.

This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, so I need to keep negotiating.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Although I could sell to John for $100, I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price. 
* **Counteroffer coming:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102?  It's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($95). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation going smoothly. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Can we agree on $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $97 is closer to my minimum price of $100, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I'm committed to getting the best possible deal and will continue to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $99. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I don't have to sell to John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price closer to Bob's last offer. 
* **Addressing Bob's concerns:** I'm acknowledging his budget constraints and demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have an alternative buyer, adding some urgency to reach a deal. 

Let's see if Bob finally accepts this offer."
