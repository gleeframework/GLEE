# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I know you've been looking for, and it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something that will truly benefit your business. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting her offer.  Rejecting the offer means Bob can go to John, who is selling the same product for the same price."
