"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is around $800,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant saving compared to its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
