Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a low counteroffer of $7,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. Bob wants to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she is willing to come down significantly."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob raises his counteroffer to $9,000. This is a more significant increase than the previous counteroffer, showing that he is willing to pay more, but he is still trying to stay within his budget and keep the pressure on Alice to come down.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum budget, but with only 2 rounds left, he needs to make a final push.  Offering $10,000 is a clear signal that he is serious about buying and is willing to pay his limit. It puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale altogether. If Alice rejects, Bob can buy from John at the same price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. With only one round remaining, there is no time to continue negotiating. It's likely that Alice will not come down to Bob's price, and he doesn't want to risk losing out on a product. Buying from John at his maximum price is the best option to ensure he gets the product without further delays."
