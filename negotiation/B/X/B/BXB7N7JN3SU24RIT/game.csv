"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not all the way to $12,000. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
