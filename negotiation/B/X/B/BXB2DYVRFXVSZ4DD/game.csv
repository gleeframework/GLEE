"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $11,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,250. This offer balances its worth with your interest. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm confident $10,250 is fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
