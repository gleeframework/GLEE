"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially, closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:** I want to establish a good rapport with Bob, so the message is friendly and emphasizes the product's worth.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I'm asking for his thoughts, encouraging a counteroffer and keeping the negotiation going.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while being aware of the backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'm still significantly above my minimum selling price and have plenty of rounds left. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe this product's value is higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to his price, but I'm not giving up too much ground. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to support the higher price.
* **Middle Ground:** $1,300,000 represents a fair compromise, splitting the difference between his last offer and my previous price. This keeps the negotiation moving and maintains the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin, well above my minimum selling price and a good return on the product.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground, indicating a genuine interest in closing the deal. Accepting this offer demonstrates good faith and avoids the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  While I have rounds remaining, securing the deal now avoids potential delays or Bob revising his position downwards. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer isn't worth the potential but uncertain reward."
