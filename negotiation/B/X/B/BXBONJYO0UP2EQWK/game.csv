"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe this product's value is higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
