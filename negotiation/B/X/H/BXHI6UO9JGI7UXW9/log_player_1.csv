Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, attempting to sell it to Bob first at a higher price could net me a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 is just below my minimum acceptable price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a good deal. 
* **Enticing Message:** Highlighting the offer as a ""steal"" and emphasizing the ""value"" aims to create a sense of urgency and downplay the price difference for Bob."
