"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This offer reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price. He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value we've discussed and allows us to both make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to give up on getting closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to know you're serious about this deal. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,270,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stating that her offer of $1,270,000 is her final compromise. While it's closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John, as he knows John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks further delays and might not result in a better price."
