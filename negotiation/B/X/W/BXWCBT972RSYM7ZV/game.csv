"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. $1,400,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value and my own costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 to show you my sincerity in making this deal happen. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
