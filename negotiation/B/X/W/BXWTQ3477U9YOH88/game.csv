"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the [product description], but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a price point in mind. While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13500 to make this work. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
