"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, considering its potential value. I believe this price is fair and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price is still below my initial offer, but it's a significant increase from your counteroffer. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and try $950,000. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it gives us both a fair deal. I'm eager to close this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. This price is a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on investment. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to go to $975,000. This is a very fair offer considering our previous negotiations. I'm ready to close this deal today if we can agree on this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This price is a good balance between what I need to make and what you're willing to pay. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
