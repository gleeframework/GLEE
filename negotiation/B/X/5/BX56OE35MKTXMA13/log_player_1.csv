"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. To start, I propose a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I want to establish a collaborative and positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Justification:**  While I haven't explicitly justified the price, mentioning the product's value to Bob hints at my reasoning for the high initial offer.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while leaving options open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can close the deal closer to $925,000.  I'm confident that the product's value to Bob provides me with some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages that I believe justify a higher price.  Would you consider $925,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to Bob, subtly reminding him why my initial high offer was justified. 
* **Seeking Agreement:**  I'm framing this counteroffer as a potential win-win, emphasizing fairness and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $910,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $920,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and willing to compromise. While I could push for a slightly higher price, $920,000 is a strong offer and exceeds my minimum by a significant amount. Accepting now ensures a successful deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me missing out on a good price by being too aggressive."
