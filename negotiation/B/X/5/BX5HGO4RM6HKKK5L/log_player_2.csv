"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $900,000.  This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable for your business.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and John's offer. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with buying from John at a lower price."
