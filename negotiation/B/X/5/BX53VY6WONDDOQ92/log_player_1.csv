Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a starting point that balances aiming for a higher price with keeping the negotiation open. 

* **Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and more likely to consider the offer. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price before selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you being interested! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Message:** I'm remaining polite and showing a willingness to negotiate, but I'm also highlighting the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Goal:** I aim to find a price that's agreeable to Bob while still maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer! I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $150 I can get from John.  Given the back-and-forth, it seems unlikely Bob will go higher, and there's a risk that further negotiation will just drag things out.  Selling to John is the most financially advantageous option at this point."
