Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to push Bob closer to our acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,625,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't justify going that high. My absolute limit is $1,450,000. If you can make that work, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,450,000 offer.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
