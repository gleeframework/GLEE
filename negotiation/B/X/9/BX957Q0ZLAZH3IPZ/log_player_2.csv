"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, as it's the same value to you as it is to me. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, there's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John later if needed."
