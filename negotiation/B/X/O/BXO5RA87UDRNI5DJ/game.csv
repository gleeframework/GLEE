"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a nice product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $825,000?  That's a fair compromise in my mind.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $825,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
