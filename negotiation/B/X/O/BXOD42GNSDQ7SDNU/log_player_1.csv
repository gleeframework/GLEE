I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a higher price than John's offer, but it gives me the potential to earn more. 

Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. I've chosen a price that I believe is high enough to be attractive to Bob while still being potentially profitable for me.  

If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's offer and still earn a profit."
