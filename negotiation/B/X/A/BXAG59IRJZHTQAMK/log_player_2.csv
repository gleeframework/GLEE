It's better to try and negotiate with Alice since her offer is above your limit.  You can try to get a lower price from her."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further.  I might be able to get the price down a bit more."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $9500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise, but it's still under her previous offer."

Alice has finally come down to my maximum budget of $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's the best price I can get without going to John. Accepting this offer means I can get the product without further negotiation."
