"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $820,000, reflecting a significant discount for you. This is a final offer from my side. If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other opportunities.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $820,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I could meet you halfway at $760,000.  That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $760,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $790,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you place on the product.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,
