I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  It's also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering Bob with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price higher than his last offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and better than selling to John.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
