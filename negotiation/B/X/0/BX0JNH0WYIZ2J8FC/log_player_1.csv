Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $20,000 is my initial asking price, I'm open to negotiation. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $15,000 is your ideal price, but I'm still only able to offer $12,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher offer, but it's unlikely to reach the guaranteed $15,000 John is offering.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point and cut my losses with further negotiation time."
