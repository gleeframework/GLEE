I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives Bob a decent discount from what I believe the product is worth, but it still leaves me with a profit. 

I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest with this initial offer. If he's willing to pay this amount, great! If not, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum price of $15,000 and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $17,000. This is still above my minimum price of $15,000 but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum price of $15,000. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more, and the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and leaving me with the option of selling to John for $15,000 isn't worth it. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
