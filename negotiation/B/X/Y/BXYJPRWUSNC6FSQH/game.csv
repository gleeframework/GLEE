"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it more reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000, but I'm not going to go higher. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
