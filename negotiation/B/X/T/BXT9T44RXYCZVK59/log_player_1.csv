Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still below John's offer. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept and make a small profit, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise while also trying to get a price that is fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my desired price range, and I'm willing to take it rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
