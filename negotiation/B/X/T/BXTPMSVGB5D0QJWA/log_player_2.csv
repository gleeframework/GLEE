Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a good price for you considering the value of the product and ensures I receive a fair return.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and this is a great price for you. It's time to accept the offer."
