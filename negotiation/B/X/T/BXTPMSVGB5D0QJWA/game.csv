"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $1,025,000. This gives you a good price and me a fair return.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $960,000?  That's a significant saving for me and still a reasonable price for you.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a good price for you considering the value of the product and ensures I receive a fair return.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
