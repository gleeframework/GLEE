"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $650,000. Would you consider $675,000?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $680,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is already a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000.",680000.0,Alice,5,
