"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great price for the product, and I think it's fair to both of us. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  This is a fair price considering I'm still paying more than what it's worth to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,
