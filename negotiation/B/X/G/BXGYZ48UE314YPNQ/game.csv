"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is a bit tighter than I expected. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,250 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100.  That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase.",9100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,100. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
