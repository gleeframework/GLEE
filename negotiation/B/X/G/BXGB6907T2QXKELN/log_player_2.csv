"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds immense value to us, but given its significance to you, we believe it's worth sharing with you at an exceptional price. We're offering the product to you for $9,500, which we believe strikes a balance between fairness and profitability for both parties. We understand its worth to you is $10,000, so this offer represents a small discount that allows you to acquire it without breaking the bank. Please let us know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can likely get a better price than $9,500. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and we have a backup option with John."
