{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for both parties. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer and keep the negotiation moving."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for this product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget.  I'm willing to go a bit lower but can't go as low as $10,000.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his last offer. This shows willingness to compromise while protecting my minimum price.

* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us,"" reinforcing the idea that the price is reasonable.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer of $10750. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.
* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is high, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John.

By selling to John, I can ensure a profit and avoid further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
