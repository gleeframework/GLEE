"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $10500 for this product.  This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget.  I'm willing to go a bit lower but can't go as low as $10000.  How about $11000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's close this deal! ",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10500 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time! ",11250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer of $10750. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",10750.0,Bob,8,
