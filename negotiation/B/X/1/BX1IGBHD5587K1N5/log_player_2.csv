"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  This is a great price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
