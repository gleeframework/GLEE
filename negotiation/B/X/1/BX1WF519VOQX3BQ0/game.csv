"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
