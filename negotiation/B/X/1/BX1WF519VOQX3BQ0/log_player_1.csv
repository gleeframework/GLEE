Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is just above my minimum value of $10,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's worth closing the deal at this point.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away altogether, or me having to settle for John's offer of $10,000."
