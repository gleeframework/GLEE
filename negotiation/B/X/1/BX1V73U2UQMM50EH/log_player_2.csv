It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you don't know Alice's minimum selling price, there's a good chance you can get it for less than $600,000."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This should gauge her willingness to negotiate and hopefully open up a dialogue for a more favorable price."

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but $500,000 is still too high.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $450,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still want a good deal.  Hopefully this will lead to a final price that's acceptable to both of us."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While I'd prefer to get it for a bit less, $475,000 is a good deal compared to the $1,500,000 I'd pay John.  It's worth accepting this offer."
