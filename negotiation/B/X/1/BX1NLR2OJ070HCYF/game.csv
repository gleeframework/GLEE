"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $750,000? That seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really testing my negotiation skills!  I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $760,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product.",760000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to invest in this product. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $790,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",790000.0,Alice,9,
