"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my minimum.  With only a few rounds left, I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the sale."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but we're running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can push for a higher price in the remaining time. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe and guaranteed option. I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
