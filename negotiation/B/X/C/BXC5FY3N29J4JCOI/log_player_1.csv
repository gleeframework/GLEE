Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential gain of $100,000. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product.
* There's always a risk that Bob might find the offer too high and reject it. However, the potential for a higher profit often outweighs this risk in a single negotiation round."
