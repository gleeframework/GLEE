"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1300000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1350000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1275000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and allows for a reasonable profit for me.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, $1275000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1225000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.
