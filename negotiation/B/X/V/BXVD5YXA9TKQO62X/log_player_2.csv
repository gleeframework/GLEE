"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of the product, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering the lowest possible price he's willing to pay. This is because he knows he can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no point in going higher.  This counteroffer forces Alice to make a decision: accept and sell at a lower price, or risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob is confident that he can negotiate further with Alice, as she's already shown a willingness to lower her price.  By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice and has another opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a slight increase from his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget constraints.  This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a price closer to Bob's budget or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has repeatedly rejected Bob's offers and is now back to a price higher than Bob's last counteroffer. This suggests that Alice is unlikely to go lower, and further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better price. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and secure the product at his maximum budget price of $800,000, rather than risk further negotiation and potential overspending."
