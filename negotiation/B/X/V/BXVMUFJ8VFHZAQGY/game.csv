"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still gives you a significant discount compared to its value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price.  How about $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
