"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me at most. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can agree to.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value to you, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000?  That's a significant price increase from my last offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
