"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $825,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",825000.0,Bob,4,
