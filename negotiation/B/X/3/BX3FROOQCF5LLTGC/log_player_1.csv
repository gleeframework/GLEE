"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At $95, Bob's offer exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee I'd reach a better outcome. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.
