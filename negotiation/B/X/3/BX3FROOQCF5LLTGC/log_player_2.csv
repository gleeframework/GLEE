"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value. It also demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.  This approach should hopefully start a constructive dialogue leading to a mutually agreeable price."
