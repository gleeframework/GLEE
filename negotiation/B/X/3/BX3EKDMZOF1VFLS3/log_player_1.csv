Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $13,000 is more than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your $15,000 minimum, so you're not losing money right away. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This creates a negotiation process that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.

By starting with a reasonable offer, you maximize your chances of selling to Bob while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below my minimum.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  My counteroffer of $12,000 is above Bob's offer of $10,000 but below my previous offer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the need to make a profit,  justifying the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Ending with ""Let me know if you're interested"" encourages further discussion and potentially a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of a prolonged back-and-forth with Bob is not worth it.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I get the best possible outcome.  I will sell the product to John."
