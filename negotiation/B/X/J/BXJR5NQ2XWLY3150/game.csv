"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer or would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is worth $80, but I've invested a lot in it and I'd like to get a better price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I've got a minimum price in mind that I'd like to stick to. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still not quite there. I'm sticking with my offer of $90. I think it's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal quickly.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $105, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
