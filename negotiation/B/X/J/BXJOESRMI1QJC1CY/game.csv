"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to achieve a significant profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
