"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value. I'm hoping to capitalize on his potential desire to acquire the product, and I'm confident that I can still negotiate down to a reasonable price if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000. I'll proceed with the next round and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $850,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but still above Bob's initial counteroffer. I believe this price is reasonable and allows for further bargaining in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can reach a deal that's more favorable to me. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

I'm going to offer my minimum price of $800,000 to Bob. Since we're nearing the middle ground, I believe this price is fair and will be acceptable to him. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to guarantee my desired price."
