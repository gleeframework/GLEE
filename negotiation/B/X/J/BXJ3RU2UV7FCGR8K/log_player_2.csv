"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go above my maximum budget of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm confident this is a price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,000 is still a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $14,000 is still significantly above my budget. I need to keep pushing for a lower price.  I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000 and still have 5 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to work with me. However, $14,000 is still out of reach for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is the absolute highest I can go while staying within my budget.  I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value we've both placed on the product.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $12,500 is still too high. I have 3 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a lower offer and see if we can finally agree."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little above my budget at $12,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is the absolute highest I can go while staying within my budget.  We're very close now, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the final round of negotiations with Alice, and her offer of $13,000 is still higher than I am comfortable with. While it's tempting to try one last counteroffer, the risk is too high. I've already had eight rounds of negotiations, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. It's better to be safe and secure the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and guarantees a purchase."
