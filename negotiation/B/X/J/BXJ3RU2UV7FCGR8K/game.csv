"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm confident this is a price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,000 is still a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to work with me. However, $14,000 is still out of reach for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is the absolute highest I can go while staying within my budget.  I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value we've both placed on the product.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little above my budget at $12,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is the absolute highest I can go while staying within my budget.  We're very close now, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
