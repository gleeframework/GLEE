"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and flexibility.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,900 as a final compromise. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $8,700? That's the highest I can go, and I hope it's a price we can both agree on.",8700.0,Bob,6,
