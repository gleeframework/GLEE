Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $100, but lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.  It also shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $115. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $115 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and it's likely the best deal I'll get from Bob. There is a risk that he will reject a counteroffer, which could lead to me having to sell to John for a lower price.  So, it's best to accept his final offer."
