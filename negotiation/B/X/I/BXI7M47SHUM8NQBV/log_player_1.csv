``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($12,000), but I'm also leaving room for negotiation to keep Bob engaged.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price slightly lower than my original offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to save money.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10750}
