"Dear Bob,

I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations and contribute to its growth. Given its value to you, I understand it might be worth more than $800,000, but I would like to propose a fair deal that respects both our interests.

I am offering the product to you for $950,000. This price reflects the quality, functionality, and potential benefits the product offers to your company. It's a chance to secure a high-value asset at a competitive rate compared to what it could fetch on the open market or elsewhere.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. I am here to discuss any concerns or negotiate terms that might make the transaction more favorable for both parties. I look forward to hearing your response.

Best regards,
Alice",950000.0,Alice,1,
