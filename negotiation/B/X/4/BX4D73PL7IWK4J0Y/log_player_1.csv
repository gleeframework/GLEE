Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest without leaving money on the table.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed positively to encourage Bob without revealing your absolute bottom line.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have the time or resources to engage in back-and-forth negotiation with Bob. If you have more time, you could potentially start even higher and see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
