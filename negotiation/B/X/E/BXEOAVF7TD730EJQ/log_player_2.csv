Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a low offer of $10,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

I'm still not comfortable paying $16,000. I'll counteroffer again, hoping we can reach a compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going up to $14,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This should be a good middle ground for us both."

We're getting close, but it's clear Alice is not willing to come down to my maximum price. I'm running out of time and rounds, so I'm going to buy from John. It's not my ideal price, but at least I can be sure I'm getting the product."
