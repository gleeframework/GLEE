,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,500 is a bit low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to get closer to my desired price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $7,750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go much higher than that.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. While $7,750 is tempting, I'm still hoping for something closer to $8,000. Let's try $7,900. That way, we can both be happy with the deal. What do you say?",7900.0,Alice,5,
