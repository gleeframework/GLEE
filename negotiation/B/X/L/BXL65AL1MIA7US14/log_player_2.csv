"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  While I cannot disclose specifics just yet, I assure you its worth is substantial. I'm proposing a price of $1500000. This reflects the inherent value and the potential benefits you'll realize.  Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting. By rejecting, you can potentially get a better price from Alice, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is my upper limit.  Given the unknowns about the product's value, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I understand your hesitation given the unknowns, but I'm confident that this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the value I place on a potential long-term partnership, and it's still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer.  You're still willing to pay more than $1,000,000, but there's no need to rush into a deal."
