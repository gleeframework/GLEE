Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is my upper limit.  Given the unknowns about the product's value, I'd like to start with an offer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I understand your hesitation given the unknowns, but I'm confident that this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value I place on a potential long-term partnership, and it's still a significant discount from my initial offer.
