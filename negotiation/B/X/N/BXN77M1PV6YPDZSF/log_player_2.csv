"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I believe represents a significant win-win for both of us. I understand its worth to you is higher than what I'm asking, and I'm confident you'll recognize the exceptional value this product holds. Let's discuss a price that works for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate and hints that she's willing to go lower. Her opening offer of $1,000,000 is already a significant markup from its value to her ($800,000). 
* While you could buy from John for $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
