"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my target price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm hoping that Bob will make a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}

I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate and having Bob walk away."
