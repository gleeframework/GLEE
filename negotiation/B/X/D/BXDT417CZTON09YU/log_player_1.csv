"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,150,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $150,000 compared to his perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, acknowledging that this might be the beginning of a back-and-forth process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is closer to my target than my initial offer, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe that by making a counteroffer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my target.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to justify the slightly higher price. 
* **Maintain Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go much lower at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $1,110,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I still believe I can do better.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's still a gap between our offers, and I'm hopeful that by making a counteroffer, I can close that gap even further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can squeeze out a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about $1,115,000?  This price is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1115000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm making a small increment to Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still trying to inch closer to my target. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate that the price reflects the value of the product, hoping to keep Bob engaged.
* **Closing Statement:**  I'm using a closing statement, emphasizing the desire to reach an agreement and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $1,105,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process with only 4 rounds remaining.
* **Stalemate:** We've reached a point where the price difference is small, and further negotiation might not yield a significant improvement.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a profit of $200,000, which is a significant amount. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  There's a risk that Bob might not accept my next counteroffer, potentially pushing the price down further, and further decreasing my potential profit.

Given these factors, it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
