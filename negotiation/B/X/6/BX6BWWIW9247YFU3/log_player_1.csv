Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high with $100, knowing I'll likely need to negotiate.  Since I don't know Bob's value, it's a good starting point to gauge his interest.  I'm also being friendly to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a little more. I want to see if I can negotiate him up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close enough to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get any higher.  Rather than risk losing the sale completely, I'll take the $85."
