"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident you'll see its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. This feels like a fair compromise for a product of this caliber.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $20,000. I'm still a bit hesitant, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $17,000. I think this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and my budget.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that. However, $17,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can offer it to you for $19,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $18,500. Can you consider this offer?",18500.0,Bob,6,
