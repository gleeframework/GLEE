Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is clearly interested in the product. Accepting $1,250,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can reach a price closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that works for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000? I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers, albeit slowly.  At $1,225,000, we're getting a good deal above our minimum and further haggling might risk losing the deal altogether. It's often better to secure a good profit than hold out for an ideal price and risk losing a sale."
