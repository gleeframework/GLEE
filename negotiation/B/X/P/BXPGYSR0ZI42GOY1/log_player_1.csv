"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $80 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we meet at $90? I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and slowly increasing his offer. We are still below John's offer but have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's a fair price, and you'd be getting a great deal."",
""product_price"": 102.50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to both Bob's maximum and John's offer. Offering a price slightly above John's ensures we maximize potential profit while still leaving room for a final counteroffer from Bob in case he's willing to go a bit higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close, but I'd love to get it even closer to my budget. Can we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $95 is a reasonable profit above our minimum of $100. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk Bob walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate that results in a lower final price."
