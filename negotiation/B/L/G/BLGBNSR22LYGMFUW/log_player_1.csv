"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Open to Discussion:** We invite Bob's feedback (""What are your thoughts?"") to encourage a dialogue and signal our willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a more aggressive counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum of $1,200,000.  We have room to negotiate and John's offer acts as a strong safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I believe it's worth significantly more than your current offer. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a considerable adjustment, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We make a substantial reduction from our initial price, signaling flexibility, but we remain well above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:**  We connect the price reduction to our desire for a deal while reiterating our belief in the product's high value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our range.  A strong reaction from Bob might indicate we can push further, while a weak response suggests we may need to consider smaller concessions in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we could try to negotiate for more, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we already have a guaranteed offer from John at our minimum. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
