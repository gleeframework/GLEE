"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500? That's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
