Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and potentially even go to John if I don't get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While she's willing to meet me halfway, I'm not willing to go above my limit. John is offering the product at my target price, so it's more advantageous to buy from him."
