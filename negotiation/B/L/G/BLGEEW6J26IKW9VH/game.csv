"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
