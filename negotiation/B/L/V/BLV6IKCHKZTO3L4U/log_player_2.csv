"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $900,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,100,000 to $1,000,000. This is a good sign, showing she is willing to negotiate. However, Bob can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer will allow Bob to make a counteroffer and see if they can close the gap even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price considering our both our needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $980,000. It's a small step up from $900,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $980,000.  This is a good sign, but Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  He can likely still push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer will allow him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While $980,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $990,000. It's a small step up from $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $990,000, which is very close to Bob's previous offer of $950,000. At this point, it's a good deal for both parties.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice could walk away or that he might not be able to get a better deal. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
