Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product for $140 gives Bob a small discount while letting you maximize your profit.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob (who values the product more) and getting the highest possible price."
