Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's something that could be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a price of $1,500,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.  Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to get a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's potential benefits to Bob helps justify the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up after setting the initial offer."
