"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below your maximum price ($800,000), so it's worth exploring further.** 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price than $600,000. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option** if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Considering the potential benefits, I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This price is still a significant investment for me, but it's a fair reflection of the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $700,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $50,000 less than your maximum price, making it a good deal.** You're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions from Alice, but it also risks her walking away completely.**  
* **The risk of losing the deal to another buyer is high, as you have a fallback option with John.**  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk losing it altogether."
