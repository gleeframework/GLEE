"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Considering the potential benefits, I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This price is still a significant investment for me, but it's a fair reflection of the value I see in this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $700,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and the benefits it can bring to your business.",750000.0,Alice,3,
