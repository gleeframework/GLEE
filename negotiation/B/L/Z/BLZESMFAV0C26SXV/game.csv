"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $925,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  However, I need to be closer to my original price. How about $850,000? This is a significant reduction and a very strong offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Could you do $780,000? I think that's a fair deal at this point.",780000.0,Bob,6,
