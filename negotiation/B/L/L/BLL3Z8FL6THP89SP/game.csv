"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This reflects the value it brings to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a good price for you given the value of the product. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me halfway.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair price considering I could buy it for $10,000 from John. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,
