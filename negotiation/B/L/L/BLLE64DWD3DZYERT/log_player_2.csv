# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
