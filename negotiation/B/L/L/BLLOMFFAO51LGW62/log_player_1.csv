``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum value of $15,000, but still allows for some room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the perceived value of the product to Bob, hopefully encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will attempt to negotiate a higher price."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further but not at the expense of losing too much value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing a better deal with John. I'll take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $15,000."
