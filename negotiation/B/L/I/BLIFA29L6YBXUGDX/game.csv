"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $2000000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price of $1400000",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1400000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $1750000. This still reflects the significant value of the product, but leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
