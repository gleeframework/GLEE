"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant amount more than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe there's room for a higher price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Opportunity cost of selling to John:**  Selling to John guarantees a higher price, but I'm not yet ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the product's value and gives you a good price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower, potentially prompting Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I'm trying to make a fair offer, considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer, while closer, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** We've made some progress, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired value.
* **Time is on my side:**  With more rounds left, I can continue to explore a deal with Bob without risking selling to John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed, and it allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant compromise:** I'm reducing my offer by $500, showing a willingness to negotiate but not giving up too much.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I emphasize that it's a ""significant compromise"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Creating urgency:** I suggest finalizing the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** Bob's offer, while tempting, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing John:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to start seriously considering the offer from John. However, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob.
* **Time to get serious:** I'm going to make a final counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll have to reconsider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to have to be firm here. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 one last time. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I will unfortunately have to consider other options.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my final counteroffer.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that I will be forced to consider other options if he doesn't accept.
* **Maintaining firmness:**  I'm holding firm at $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my part but still a reasonable price for the product.
* **Considering John's offer:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm starting to weigh the potential benefits of selling to John versus continuing to negotiate with Bob."
