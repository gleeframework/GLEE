"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the product's value and gives you a good price.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I'm trying to make a fair offer, considering the value you mentioned earlier.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed, and it allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to have to be firm here. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 one last time. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I will unfortunately have to consider other options.  Let me know your decision.",10000.0,Alice,7,
