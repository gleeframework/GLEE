"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. While I cannot disclose the specific details at this moment, I can assure you that the product is worth at least $800000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $900000, a price that reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, and if you decline, I will be obligated to sell it to another buyer.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment. Please consider this carefully and let me know your decision.",900000.0,Alice,1,
