"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) leaves room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it sets a strong anchor for future rounds.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message maintains a positive tone, crucial for successful bargaining.  It acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle for $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is closer to our budget, it's above our ideal price. Alice moving towards our offer suggests she's open to further negotiation. 
* **Leverage:** We still have several rounds left and the option of buying from John acts as a safety net. This puts us in a good position to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving incrementally ($15 increase) towards Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise but also holding firm on getting a good deal.
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** $75 is exactly halfway between our initial offer and her counteroffer, making it psychologically appealing as a potential agreement point. 
* **Maintaining Communication:** The message continues to be friendly and solution-oriented, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $85? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $85 is within our budget and only slightly above our ideal price. Trying to haggle further might irritate Alice and risk losing the deal.
* **Time Factor:**  While we have rounds left,  there's no guarantee of getting a better price from Alice. Accepting now secures the product within our budget.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice means delaying potentially finding even better deals elsewhere with the time saved."
