"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This price is still fair to you, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation.  Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to meet you at $14,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $17,000, which is still a good deal considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,
