Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. It also ensures that you are getting a price closer to your minimum desired value of $15,000.  This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving open the option to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. Although it's closer to his valuation, it's still far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $10,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it might encourage Bob to accept. It also shows flexibility on my end, which could lead to a more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now $9,500, which is closer to my desired price and a significant profit for me. It's worth accepting this offer as further negotiation might not yield a much higher price, and I risk losing the sale entirely."
