"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high.  It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** I don't want to lowball too much and offend Alice, especially in the early rounds.  $7,000 is a reasonable starting point that's still beneficial to me if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $8,250 is still closer to her desired price than mine. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $7,500? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  I'm moving up from my previous offer, but not drastically. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Middle Ground:** $7,500 is a bit closer to the middle ground between our initial offers.  It might be a tempting compromise for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is my best price, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice has indicated that $8,000 is her best price. This aligns with what we know about the product's value to her.
* **Good Deal:** $8,000 is a very good price for the product, saving me $2,000 from John's offer. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to Alice walking away, or me running out of rounds. Accepting now secures a great price."
