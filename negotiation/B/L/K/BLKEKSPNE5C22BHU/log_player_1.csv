Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,490,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment at this price."", 
""product_price"": 1490000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Understand Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.  We need to offer a price that's significantly less than our reserve while still enticing to him. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to still land above our $1,500,000 floor. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the potential benefits to Bob's business, we're adding perceived value, making the price more palatable.

It's a balancing act! We want to push for the best possible price without pushing Bob away entirely."
