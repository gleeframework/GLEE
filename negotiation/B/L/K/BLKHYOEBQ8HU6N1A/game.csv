"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is significantly below my asking price, and doesn't reflect the value this product brings. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a substantial discount from my original asking price.  This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns. Let's make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
