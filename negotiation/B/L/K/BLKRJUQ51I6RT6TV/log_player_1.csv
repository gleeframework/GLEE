"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $16,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe it's a good price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant. Let's meet in the middle - how about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely he'll reach my $12,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, making it the safest and most profitable option at this point."
