{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob is consistently moving closer to our desired price point. It's worth risking another round to see if we can push for a higher price.  We can always fall back on John's offer if needed."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $915,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not significantly increasing his offer amounts.  He's gone up $15,000 in two rounds. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to $940,000 or higher within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees our desired profit and avoids further negotiation risk."
