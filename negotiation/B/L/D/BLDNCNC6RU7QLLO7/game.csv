"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $12,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12100.0,Alice,7,
