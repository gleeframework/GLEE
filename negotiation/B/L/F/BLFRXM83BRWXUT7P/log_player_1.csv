Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but I'm also aware that I can always lower the price if necessary.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value. While I could accept and move on, I want to see if I can get more. There's always the risk that Bob will walk away, but I'm willing to take that chance for the potential of a higher profit. I'll counteroffer and see where the negotiation goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise - halfway between my starting point and Bob's offer.  I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting significantly lower. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, it's still a significant drop from my minimum value.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time.  If he rejects that, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This is my last offer. I'm meeting him halfway between my last offer and his. It's a significant drop from my original asking price, but it's still above my minimum. If he rejects this, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price, even after several rounds of negotiation.  I've already countered a few times and it seems unlikely he'll come up any higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer."
