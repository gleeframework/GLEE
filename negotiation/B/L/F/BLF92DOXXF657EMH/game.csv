"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this unique product. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
