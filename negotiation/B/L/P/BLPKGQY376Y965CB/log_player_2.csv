"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so you have no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer of $9,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a better deal than buying from John for $10,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. It's in your best interest to accept her offer and secure the product at a good price."
