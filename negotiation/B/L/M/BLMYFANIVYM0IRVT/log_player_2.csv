Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,800 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,200. It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
