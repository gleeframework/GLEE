Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll see its value."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. It's not worth the risk of Bob's offer dropping further, or the time it will take to potentially negotiate a higher price.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome right now."
