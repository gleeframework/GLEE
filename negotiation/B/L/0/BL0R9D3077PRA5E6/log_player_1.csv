Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we discuss $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is now offering our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee of securing a better deal in further rounds, and we risk him lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
