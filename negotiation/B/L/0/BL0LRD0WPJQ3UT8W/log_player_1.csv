Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I still have rounds left to negotiate and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll propose $1,300,000. Can we find a mutually beneficial price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob or John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price is still fair to both of us, and it ensures a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's becoming clear that we are too far apart in our valuations.  To ensure I get a fair price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
