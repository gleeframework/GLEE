Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal (saving $10) while maximizing your profit. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
