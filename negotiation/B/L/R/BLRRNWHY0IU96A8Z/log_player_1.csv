Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $135 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  A higher starting price gives you more room to negotiate.
* **Keeps John in mind:**  $135 allows for some wiggle room while still remaining a better offer than John's $150. 
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than simply rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $125 is below your minimum of $150. While it's tempting to take the offer, it would result in a loss for you. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate indicate there's still potential to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150 gives you leverage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price that is still higher than his offer but lower than your minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm happy to come down a bit, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  $130 is a compromise, meeting halfway between your initial offer and Bob's. 
* **Friendly tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  The message provides a rationale for the counter-offer, making it seem less arbitrary. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  $130 is closer to your desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Shows flexibility:**  Demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Keeps John in mind:**  $130 is still a better deal than John's offer, so you have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:**  $128 is still below your minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:**  Bob's offer is very close to his initial offer, suggesting he might be unwilling to budge much further.  
* **John's offer guarantees a profit:**  Accepting John's offer ensures you get your desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

It's best to sell the product to John. You're guaranteed a profit, and the time and effort invested in negotiating with Bob may not be worth the potential small increase in price."
