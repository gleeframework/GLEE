Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed offer creates the perception of a deal while leaving little room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason emphasizes the value of the product.

**Important:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay more due to various factors like urgency, lack of alternatives, or perceived future value. This offer aims to capitalize on that possibility."
