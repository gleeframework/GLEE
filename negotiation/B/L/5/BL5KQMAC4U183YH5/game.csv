"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1050000.  I believe this price is fair, reflecting both our respective valuations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
