Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  This anchors the negotiation at a high point. Even though it's above Bob's valuation, it leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem less desperate to sell quickly. 
* **Leaving an Opening:** By stating you're ""open to discussing,"" you signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have John as a backup buyer, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** This counter-offer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000), showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Concession:** By explicitly mentioning the ""significant reduction,"" you emphasize that you're making a compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still aiming significantly above Bob's perceived value and closer to your minimum, keeping the pressure on him to move closer to your price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is now slightly higher than what John is willing to pay. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains, with a risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. 
* **""Final Offer"" Psychology:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. While he could change his mind, it suggests you're unlikely to get much more out of him. 

It's a good business decision to accept a profitable offer rather than risk losing the sale for a potentially small increase."
