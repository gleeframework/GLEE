"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to both of us. Let's make this deal happen! How about we start at $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $75. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point, and we can always negotiate further depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the product price at $65? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get her down a bit more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $65 is closer, but I'm hoping to land somewhere around $62. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 62
}
```

We're nudging the price closer to our target while still acknowledging Alice's effort to find a compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving and maintains a positive tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested, Bob. Let's see if we can't get a little closer. How about setting the product price at $63? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come up to $63, which is a good deal. It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept and secure the product."
