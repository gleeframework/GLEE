Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's good to know his initial valuation, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the benefits it brings. "", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can do $12,000, which I think is a fair offer considering the market value.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $12,000 is still too low. I'll counter-offer again, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as we progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to go to $13,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  It's a strong offer, and I need a decision so I can explore other options if we can't agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $13,000 offer. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from him than $13,000.  It's time to cut my losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
