"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the benefits it brings. ",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can do $12,000, which I think is a fair offer considering the market value.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I have to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to go to $13,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  It's a strong offer, and I need a decision so I can explore other options if we can't agree.",13000.0,Bob,6,
