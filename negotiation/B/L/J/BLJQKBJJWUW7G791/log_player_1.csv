"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is still a decent amount above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm starting to get a little nervous, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round.  I'm hoping he's starting to see the value of the product and is willing to go up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my desired price.  $125 is just a bit more than my minimum, so I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise.  If he rejects this, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John."
