"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to move from my initial price. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger stretch than I can make right now.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $800,000. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to accept $975,000 - it's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right this product has potential, but that final offer is still a bit too rich for me.  I could go up to $850,000 to get this done today.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a figure we both find agreeable. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $925,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I think we are very close. To get this across the finish line today, how about $875,000? ",875000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, you're right, we're very close. Let's wrap this up â€“ $900,000, and we have a deal.",900000.0,Alice,9,
