"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000. This price still leaves plenty of room for you to make a profit and is more reflective of the product's true value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
