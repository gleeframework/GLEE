"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to understanding your perspective."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" without being overly specific. This leaves room for Bob to potentially justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating this is a ""starting point"" and welcoming Bob's perspective, we signal our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This initial offer is about finding a balance between being assertive and encouraging a productive negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than our target price. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss compared to Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but $1,800,000 is still below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and frame our rejection positively. This helps maintain a good negotiating relationship.
* **Middle Ground:** By suggesting a price of $2,000,000, we're signaling a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Clear Communication:** We clearly state our desired price and avoid ambiguity, encouraging a direct response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a genuine interest in the product. We are getting closer to a price point where we might settle, but we still have some negotiating room. Accepting $1,900,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table. We can afford to counter again before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting close. I respect your budget considerations, and to show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a smaller concession this time ($50,000) to signal we are nearing our limit.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  $1,950,000 is a strong compromise, acknowledging Bob's increments while staying significantly above our absolute minimum.

This offer aims to either secure a deal now at a very favorable price or prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay if he counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially negotiate for a bit more, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to $1,950,000.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,850,000 is still a substantial profit above our minimum price ($1,500,000) and a good return on the negotiation effort.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push risks Bob walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 

While selling to John guarantees our minimum, accepting Bob's offer provides a significant profit increase for a relatively small risk."
