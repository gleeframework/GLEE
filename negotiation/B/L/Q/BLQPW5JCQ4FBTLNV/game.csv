"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I've done my research, and I believe the product's value is closer to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counter with an offer of $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $875,000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll counter with an offer of $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's reach an agreement and move forward with the sale.",890000.0,Bob,6,
