# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. What do you think?

Bob can do better than $900,000. He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I've done my research, and I believe the product's value is closer to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counter with an offer of $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  Alice has come up slightly from her original offer, but Bob is still hoping to pay less. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $875,000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll counter with an offer of $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

While $920,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
