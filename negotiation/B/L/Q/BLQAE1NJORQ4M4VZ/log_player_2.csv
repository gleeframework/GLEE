Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $11,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. It's still a great value for a product like this.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a great deal for you. It's the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stuck at a price that's higher than what John is offering.  It's unlikely she'll go down to $10,000. There's no point in wasting more rounds negotiating when you can get the product at your target price from John."
