"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a truly unique opportunity.  I'm asking for $950,000, which I believe is a fair price given its value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $700,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to get closer to the value I need.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground.  Would you be willing to accept $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $775,000.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $825,000.  That's only $50,000 more, and it's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $800,000. That's a very strong offer, and it meets the value you've placed on the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
