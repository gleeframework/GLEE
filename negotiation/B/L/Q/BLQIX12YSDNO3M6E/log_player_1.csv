Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a truly unique opportunity.  I'm asking for $950,000, which I believe is a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $700,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to get closer to the value I need."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground.  Would you be willing to accept $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $775,000.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $825,000.  That's only $50,000 more, and it's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 825000}
