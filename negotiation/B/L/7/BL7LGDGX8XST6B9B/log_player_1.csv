"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500.  This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn a significant profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a price close to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is not a reasonable price for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly to $14,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair to me. I believe this counteroffer is a good middle ground that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still not quite there.  I'm not ready to sell for $13,500 yet. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

I'm adjusting my counteroffer to $13,800.  This is a small concession, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,700 is very close to my desired price, and I'm concerned that I'll lose the deal if I continue to reject offers.  Even though it's slightly lower than my ideal, it's still a good deal for me.  I'm going to accept the offer and move on."
