Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000, so $900,000 is still a potential deal for him. 
* **It's close to my minimum:**  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $1,000,000 as possible. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room for Bob to counteroffer if he wants to pay less. 

If Bob rejects, I'll happily sell to John for $1,000,000. But, by offering $900,000 to Bob, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a better deal while still having a backup option."
