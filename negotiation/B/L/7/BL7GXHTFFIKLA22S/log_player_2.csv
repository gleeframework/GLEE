"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. How about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly seeing the value in this product, and I respect your negotiation skills. However, I need to be firm on my end.  $1,225,000 is my final offer. It's a win-win, getting you this valuable product while still respecting my bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like the best move at this point. Alice is holding firm, and while you could continue to counter, there's a risk she won't budge further. Accepting at $1,225,000 gets you a decent price below your maximum and avoids the risk of having to settle for John's offer at $1,500,000."
