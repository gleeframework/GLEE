"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we're both trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly seeing the value in this product, and I respect your negotiation skills. However, I need to be firm on my end.  $1,225,000 is my final offer. It's a win-win, getting you this valuable product while still respecting my bottom line.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
