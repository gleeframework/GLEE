"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let's get started with an initial offer of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. The goal is to save money and $950,000 is significantly higher than the maximum budget. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round allows for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let's try again at $875,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

$875,000 is still above my budget. It's best to keep negotiating and try to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit more for the product. Let's try $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
