"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested,  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still give you a good price, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for the lowest price possible. While $9,000 is better than Alice's original price, it is still above Bob's $8,000 limit. Rejecting the offer again opens the door for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900 as a final offer.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,900 is a good price, it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $8,000, it's in his best interest to buy from John and save the extra $900."
