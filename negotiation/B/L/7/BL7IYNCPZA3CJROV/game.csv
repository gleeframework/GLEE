,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a fair profit.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $85? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to make a decision at that price.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to accept that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
