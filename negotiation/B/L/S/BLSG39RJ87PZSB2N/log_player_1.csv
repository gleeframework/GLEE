"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value to me! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  I start with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially capture more value. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language like ""steal"" to make the offer seem appealing to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I indicate that I'm open to discussing the price, signaling that a deal is possible. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware that my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.  I will continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses while keeping this minimum in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  
* **I have 9 rounds remaining.** There's still time to try and negotiate a better price with Bob or potentially secure a deal with John if necessary. 
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.** This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a price closer to my minimum:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, showing flexibility but still staying above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""value of the product"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I remain polite and encouraging to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**
* **I have 7 rounds remaining.** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come closer to my price.
* **There's a chance John might become impatient or find a better deal.** I need to be careful about delaying the sale too long. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to compromise, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than that, considering the potential benefits you've mentioned.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price to the minimum:** I'm now offering the product for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Appealing to his potential gains:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product and highlighting the potential benefits to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Framing it as a win-win:**  I use phrases like ""fair deal"" and ""meet in the middle"" to emphasize the mutually beneficial nature of the deal. 

**Strategy:**  This is a crucial round. If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll have to weigh the risks of continuing negotiations with him versus securing the $1,000,000 deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  He's only increased his offer by $25,000, showing that he's not willing to come close to my desired price. 
* **We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations (6 rounds out of 10).**  Time is running out, and I'm running the risk of John changing his mind or finding a better deal. 
* **The potential gains from continuing are minimal.**  Bob is only offering a small increase each time, and I don't see him drastically changing his stance.

While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, the risk of losing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John outweighs the potential gains from continuing negotiations with Bob. I'm confident that securing this deal is the best option at this point."
