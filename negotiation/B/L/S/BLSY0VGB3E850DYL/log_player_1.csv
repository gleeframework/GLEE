Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price depending on Bob's response. 

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially make counteroffers to secure the best possible price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $12,000 to you. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price point, potentially securing a better deal than selling to John.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, you can still sell to John and guarantee your minimum value. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price that's higher than his offer but still lower than your minimum. This will show you're willing to negotiate while protecting your interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I can't accept $10,000.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your desired price:** This shows you're willing to compromise but still want a decent profit.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, you can still adjust your counteroffer slightly, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:** It prevents you from having to immediately sell to John, giving you more leverage. 

This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation while ensuring you remain in a favorable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your offer, Alice, and while I'm not willing to pay $11000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $12,000 to you. Accepting his offer would still mean a loss.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  You can make one more counteroffer that's closer to your desired price point. It's possible Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly to avoid losing the deal.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, you can still sell to John and guarantee your minimum value.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's closer to $11,000. If he rejects again, you can move forward with selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway on this.  My final offer is $10,750.  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it would be a shame to let this deal slip away.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:** This is your last chance to negotiate with Bob. You're offering a price that's slightly closer to his offer but still above your minimum.
* **Strong message:**  You're emphasizing that this is a good deal for both parties and that you're willing to compromise.
* **Prepares for a potential rejection:** You're setting the stage for a potential move to sell to John if Bob rejects your offer. 

This counteroffer is your last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects it, you can confidently move on to John and secure your minimum value."
