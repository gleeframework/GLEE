"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. It's not a good deal.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

You're trying to get the best deal possible, so start by offering significantly less than Alice's initial price.  $70 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. Keep negotiating to see if you can get Alice down to a price you're comfortable with.  You have more rounds and can still go to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

You've already offered $70 and Alice rejected it. Now, increase your offer slightly to $75. This shows you're willing to compromise but are still holding firm to your goal of getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get a better deal. It's worth a few more rounds of negotiation to see if Alice will come down to a price closer to your goal of $80. You always have the option of buying from John for $80 if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

This is your final offer! You're willing to pay the maximum you've set for yourself. This is a good strategy because Alice might be willing to accept it to avoid losing the sale altogether. If she rejects, you can go to John for $80, so you're not at risk of losing out."
