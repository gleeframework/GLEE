"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, hoping to capture most of the value.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll keep in mind my minimum price and the potential of selling to John for $100 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm going to try and push for a higher price. I'm not ready to settle for $130 yet, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the whole profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer, so I'm going to accept it. I've managed to get close to my desired price and I don't want to risk going back and forth again and potentially ending up with a lower price, or even having to sell to John for $100."
