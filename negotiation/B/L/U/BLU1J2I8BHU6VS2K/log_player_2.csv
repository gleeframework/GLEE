# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off going with the guaranteed lower price."
