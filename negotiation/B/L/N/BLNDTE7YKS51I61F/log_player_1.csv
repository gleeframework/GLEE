Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $140 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150 and be sure of a sale, there's a chance Bob will accept the $140 offer, giving you a higher profit."
