{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where you are still earning a significant profit, but also leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  It sets the stage for a possible counteroffer from him, allowing for more negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us both."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
