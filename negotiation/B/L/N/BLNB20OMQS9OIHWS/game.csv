,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and would still be a good deal for you considering the potential value of this product. Let's find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my reach. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a significant amount less than my initial offer. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you still need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a considerable increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that I believe reflects the value of this product. I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer. ",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my sincere desire to make a deal.  I'm running out of rounds, so let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but we're running out of time. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is the lowest I can go.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll accept it.  If not, we'll have to move on to other options.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
