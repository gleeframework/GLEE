Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This allows for a potential deal while ensuring I am still above my minimum price of $150. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then either counter with a lower price or move on to John to secure the $150 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150, I'll choose to sell the product to John.  It's not as high as I might have hoped for, but it's the most secure and profitable option in this scenario."
