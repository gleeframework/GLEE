Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's priced fairly given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is a bit outside my budget right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value, I'd be willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a good compromise and shows my commitment to this deal. Let's try to close this gap.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's only my minimum price, it's a good deal considering the limited time and the possibility of further negotiation.  There's a chance I might get a higher offer later, but the risk is too high.  It's best to secure the deal now."
