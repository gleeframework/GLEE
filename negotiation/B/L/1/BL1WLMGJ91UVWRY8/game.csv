"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product at a price of $1400000. It's a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  thank you for your offer, but I'm unfortunately unable to meet that price point at this time.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  This is a significant investment for me, but it's the maximum I can afford right now. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1100000 is simply too far below the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price reflects a substantial discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our earlier discussions. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible. While I appreciate your persistence, $1150000 is simply too far below the product's worth for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000 as a final compromise. This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I truly appreciate the concessions you've made.  However, $1200000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1175000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product. I'm hopeful we can find a way to make this work.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1175000 is still too far below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1187500. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",1187500.0,Alice,7,
