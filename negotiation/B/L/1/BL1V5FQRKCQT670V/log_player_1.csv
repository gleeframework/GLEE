Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a smaller step down from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is still a good deal.  It's significantly above my minimum value and it seems like he's not willing to go much higher.  I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to settle for John's offer, so I'll accept it."
