"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still too far below the product's real worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $850,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
