"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's truly one-of-a-kind. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1100000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950000?  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1050000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's getting closer to my original price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $975000. I'm thinking of a compromise between that and my original price. How about we meet at $1075000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
