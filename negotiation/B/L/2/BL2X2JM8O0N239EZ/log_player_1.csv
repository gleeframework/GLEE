Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but not ridiculously high. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the price to make it seem more legitimate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the door open for Bob to counter-offer, which is crucial for a successful negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or propose a new price.  I will also keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is better than John's offer ($11,000 vs. $12,000), it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is willing to pay a premium, indicating he values the product.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming to find a compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer with a price between $11,000 and my initial offer of $13,500.  This will show I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrate that I won't settle for a price significantly below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for this product.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous price and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to reinforce the perceived fairness of my offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I've used phrases like ""close this deal"" to add a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a profitable deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer of $12,000, which is now my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11,800, which is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,800 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Further Negotiation Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk lowering the price further or prolonging the process, potentially causing me to lose John's offer.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $12,000 is a safe and guaranteed deal, ensuring I meet my minimum target price.

**Conclusion:**

While I would ideally prefer to sell the product for a higher price,  accepting John's offer is the most sensible decision at this point. It guarantees a sale and avoids any further negotiation risks."
