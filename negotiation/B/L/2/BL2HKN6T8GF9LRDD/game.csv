"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on $12,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
