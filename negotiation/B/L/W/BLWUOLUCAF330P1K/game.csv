"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1500000. Let me know if you're interested!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but I believe the product is worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $1250000? I think that's a good balance between our previous offers.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I still think $1250000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we try $1200000? I know you mentioned your budget, but I believe this product is worth every penny to you.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1050000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
