Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't agree to $11,500. I believe I can offer you $11,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $11,000 is still a good deal for him, and I think I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my asking price.  How about $11,250? This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it gives us both a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $11,100 as the price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired amount and we're already halfway through the rounds.  There's a risk of not closing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer, which is significantly lower."
