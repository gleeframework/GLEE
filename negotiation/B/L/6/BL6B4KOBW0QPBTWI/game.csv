"Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10000 right now.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
