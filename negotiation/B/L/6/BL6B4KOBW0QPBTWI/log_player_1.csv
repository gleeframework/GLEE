"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10000 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low, and I think I can get a better price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
