Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000 and you have a guaranteed option for $800,000 with John. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John at this point."
