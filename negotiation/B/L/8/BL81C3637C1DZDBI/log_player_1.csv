Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm also recognizing that Bob might be hesitant to pay that much. I'll be ready to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value with a counteroffer."

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation, hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm also considering the potential for John to change his mind, which might force me to accept a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still holding firm at a price that is closer to my minimum value. I believe this offer is reasonable and  might be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum price, the negotiation seems to be stuck. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but it's becoming a long process. I'm running the risk of losing John, who is offering a much better price. 

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John to ensure I get the best possible price."
