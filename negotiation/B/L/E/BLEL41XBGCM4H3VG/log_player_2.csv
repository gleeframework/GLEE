"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's room to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,175,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's still some wiggle room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and drive the price down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000, but it's getting close.  Considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of further negotiation failing,  it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer.  The potential savings of $50,000 are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to pay John's full price."
