Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I need to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value.  I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $950,000 is still below what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000?"",

Round 4

# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the product price at $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and engaged in the negotiation.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to try and push for a bit more before accepting."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference on our last two numbers and settle at $967,500? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I seek in the product, I propose we finalize the price at $962,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push Bob a little further, we're reaching the point of diminishing returns. Accepting his offer of $962,500 secures a very strong profit and avoids the risk of him walking away if we push too hard."
