"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and hopefully still works for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",12250.0,Bob,4,
