Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.

**Strategy:**

By offering the product at $140, you create a win-win situation:

* **Bob:**  Gets the product for $40 less than his perceived value.
* **You:** Make a $40 profit, which is better than nothing if Bob rejects and you sell to John. 

This strategy aims to secure a good profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
