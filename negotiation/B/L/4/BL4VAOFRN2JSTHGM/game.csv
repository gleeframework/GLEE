"Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of high value to you. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay $90 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and $90 is closer to my minimum.  However, to make this work for me, I need to be at least $100.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100. However, I'm still looking to spend closer to my initial offer of $80.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $90. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",90.0,Bob,6,
