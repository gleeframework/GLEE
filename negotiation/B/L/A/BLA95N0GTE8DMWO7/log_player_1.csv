"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer above your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the product's worth in Bob's mind and justify the high starting price.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the initial offer is high, it's crucial to stay significantly below John's offer ($1,500,000) to maintain that as a viable fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,100,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he's expressing interest, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. You have room to negotiate, and the potential to get a better deal from Bob is higher than immediately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is substantial. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects a more realistic compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** A $300,000 decrease from your initial offer signals flexibility, but it's essential to make substantial adjustments early on in these high-stakes negotiations.
* **Reiterating Value:** Emphasize the product's value again to justify the still-high price and steer Bob away from anchoring too strongly to his initial low offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge much from $1,100,000, you might consider moving closer to John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This is a significant step towards finding a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and provides a $100,000 profit. While you could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* Reduce his offer.
* Reach an impasse, leading to a failed negotiation. 

Accepting the current offer secures a good deal and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
