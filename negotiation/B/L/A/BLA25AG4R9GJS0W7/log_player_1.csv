Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $10,000, given its value."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $2,000) while also allowing you to maximize your profit, earning $2,000 more than selling to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that significantly benefits you."
