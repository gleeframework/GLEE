"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,750. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've done my research, and I'm confident that $8,750 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at this price. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  While I'd prefer to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000 from John."
