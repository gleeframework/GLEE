"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to make a good purchase. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
