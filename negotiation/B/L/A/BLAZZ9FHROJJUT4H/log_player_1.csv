{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for you to make concessions if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This allows Bob to quickly understand the deal.

By offering $10,000, I'm hoping to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching an agreement with Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can always counter-offer or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not ready to sell at that price just yet. I believe I can get closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to make a good purchase. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob. I'll make one final counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. At this point, it's better for me to sell the product to John for my minimum price than continue negotiating with Bob."
