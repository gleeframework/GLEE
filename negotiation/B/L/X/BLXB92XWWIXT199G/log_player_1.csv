Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.

We're still significantly below what John is offering and have room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and moving towards our price point."

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground.  While I value meeting your budget needs,  I'm confident this product offers significant returns beyond the price point we're discussing. To bridge the gap, I propose $1,050,000. This represents a significant investment from my side, reflecting my desire to see you benefit from this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my budget. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Bob has given his final offer, and it's too far below John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will move significantly from this point, and we risk losing a guaranteed $1,000,000.  It's time to cut our losses and sell to John."
