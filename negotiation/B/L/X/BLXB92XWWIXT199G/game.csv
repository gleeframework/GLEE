"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that allows us both to benefit.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. It possesses unique features and benefits that justify a higher price point. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects its true value and my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground.  While I value meeting your budget needs,  I'm confident this product offers significant returns beyond the price point we're discussing. To bridge the gap, I propose $1,050,000. This represents a significant investment from my side, reflecting my desire to see you benefit from this product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my budget. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
