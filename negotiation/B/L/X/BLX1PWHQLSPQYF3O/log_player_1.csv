Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to go lower.  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation."
