Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  He values the product at $1,000,000, so he might be willing to pay a little more.
* **It's below your minimum:** You won't settle for less than $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a good starting point for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
