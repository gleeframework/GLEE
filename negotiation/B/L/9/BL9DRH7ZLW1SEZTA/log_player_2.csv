"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. I'm offering it to you for $900,000.  It's a great price, considering its true worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than John's $1,000,000.
* **Even though you value the product at $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000.** It's still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than your perceived value."
