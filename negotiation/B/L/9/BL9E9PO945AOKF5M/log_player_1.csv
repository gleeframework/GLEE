Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the product's worth.  I'll counter-offer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest,  $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$750,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low. I'll counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. How about we settle at $825,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate you working with me. While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming to keep my expenses below $800,000.  Would you consider $780,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $780,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my target. I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing too much money. I'll sell to John for $800,000 to secure a fair deal."
