{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum value, allowing room for negotiation if needed. It also opens the conversation with a friendly greeting and expresses confidence in the product's appeal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$80 is far below my minimum value of $150.  I will counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $140?  This would still give me some room to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  I'm really keen on getting this product and that's the absolute maximum I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'll sell it to him for $150."
