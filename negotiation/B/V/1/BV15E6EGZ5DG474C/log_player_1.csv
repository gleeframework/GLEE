Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a strategic first offer:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial deal.
* **It's a strong opening:**  Showing you're confident in your product's value.
* **It allows for a clear path:** If Bob rejects, you can lower your price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, maintaining leverage.

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price.  By rejecting, you maintain the upper hand and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer strategically:

* **Compromises, but not too much:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your value.
* **Highlights the benefit for Bob:**  Reminding him of the deal's value to him.
* **Uses persuasive language:** Expressing enthusiasm and urging closure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has stuck to his original offer of $13,000, and while you're willing to negotiate, it's becoming clear that you're unlikely to reach a price that meets your minimum.  You've already made significant concessions, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better result. 

Selling to John at $15,000 ensures you get your minimum, and likely more, without the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
