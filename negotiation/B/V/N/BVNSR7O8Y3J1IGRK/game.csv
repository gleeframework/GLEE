"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to go up to $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $130 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $130.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that, or we can explore other options.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $145. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $145 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $130.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that, or I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",130.0,Bob,6,
