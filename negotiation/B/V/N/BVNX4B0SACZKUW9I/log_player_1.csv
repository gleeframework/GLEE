Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount compared to what others are willing to pay."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (John's offer) as possible while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so our offer needs to be significantly below that to be appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price, while still keeping us comfortably above our minimum. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
