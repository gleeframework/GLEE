``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than his initial value of $100, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's moving closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $107 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $109? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to counter with $108. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, the negotiation is getting tedious and I'm worried that it might drag on further.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might get frustrated and walk away.  To avoid this risk, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
