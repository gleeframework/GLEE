"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny.  My initial price is $11,000, but I'm open to discussing it further.  Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done my research, and I believe it's worth that amount. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your research, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is closer to my asking price, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  Let's split the difference at $9,750.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,
