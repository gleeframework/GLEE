"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this number.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is considerably below my bottom line. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
