Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're being realistic about the value of the product, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, which is $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

While I could continue negotiating, Bob has now reached a price point where he's signaling a firm limit. Accepting his offer of $925,000 is a substantial profit above my minimum and prolonging the negotiation might lead to a worse outcome."
