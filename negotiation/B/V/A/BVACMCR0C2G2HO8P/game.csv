"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your operations. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Would you be interested in exploring this further? I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
