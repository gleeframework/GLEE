Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($10,000) risks losing out on potential profit. 

By setting the price at $11,500, Alice creates a good balance between maximizing her profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
