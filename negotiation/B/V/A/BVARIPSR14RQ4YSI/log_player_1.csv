Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me and $8,000 to Bob.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm giving Bob some room to negotiate.  
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the deal's value to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can potentially secure a higher price. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then consider his counteroffer and either accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. If the negotiation doesn't go anywhere, I can always sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, it would be a significant financial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price between his offer of $8,500 and my minimum of $12,000.  This will allow for further negotiation while still ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly below what the product is worth to me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $9,500 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product to him.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone and focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the chances of him accepting.  However, $9,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess and decide whether to counter again or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise that avoids further negotiation and ensures I don't lose money. 

**Strategy:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer to close the deal. It's a good deal for both of us, considering Bob's initial offer of $8,500 and my minimum price of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result, and it risks losing the sale entirely."
