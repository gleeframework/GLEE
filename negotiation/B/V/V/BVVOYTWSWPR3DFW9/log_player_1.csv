"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. 
* This allows me to potentially get a good price while also starting a negotiation process that encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer and how many rounds are left. 
* I'm keeping the option of selling to John at $8,000 open as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is above my minimum threshold, it's still significantly below my initial asking price and what I believe the product is worth.
* I have 8 rounds left, which gives me enough room to try and negotiate a higher price. 
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that shows I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low.
* This also demonstrates my commitment to getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to drop my price too drastically. 
* It also puts pressure on Bob to compromise and potentially meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. 
* With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue pushing for a higher price.
* I'm confident I can achieve a better deal than Bob's current offer, given his perceived value of the product.
* By rejecting his offer, I signal my willingness to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my offer again, showing further flexibility and acknowledging Bob's reluctance to go higher. 
* However, I'm still above his last offer, showing that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a compromise.
* I'm still 5 rounds away from needing to make a decision about John, so there's still room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, but it's also the same price John is willing to pay.
* With only 4 rounds left, the chances of Bob increasing his offer further are slim.
* I'm at risk of ending up with the minimum price after multiple rounds of negotiation. 
* It's strategically better to sell to John now and secure the guaranteed $8,000. This avoids further negotiation rounds that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
