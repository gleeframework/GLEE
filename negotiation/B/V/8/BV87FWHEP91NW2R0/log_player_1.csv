Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers, indicating a strong desire for the product. Accepting at $1,725,000 secures a significant profit above our $1,500,000 minimum and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out entirely in later rounds."
