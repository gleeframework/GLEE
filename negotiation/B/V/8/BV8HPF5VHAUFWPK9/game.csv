"Alice, thanks for the offer!  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Considering my budget and the value I'm aiming for, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to consider your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $1100000.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1000000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1050000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
