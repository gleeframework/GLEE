"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10750.0,Bob,4,
