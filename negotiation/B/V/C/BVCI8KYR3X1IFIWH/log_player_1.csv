Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While brief, mentioning ""its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding, and phrases like ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's little risk in aiming higher with Bob."
