"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I believe the product is valuable,  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
