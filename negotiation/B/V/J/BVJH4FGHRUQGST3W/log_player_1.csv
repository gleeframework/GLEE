"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more affordable.  How about $700,000? That's a significant investment for me but reflects the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob, so I will counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for you.  Let's come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
