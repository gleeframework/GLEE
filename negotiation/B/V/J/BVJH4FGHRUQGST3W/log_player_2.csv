"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. I believe this product can be very beneficial for your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more affordable.  How about $700,000? That's a significant investment for me but reflects the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for you.  Let's come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation: While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best possible price."
