"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price that's still within Bob's range, but gives me a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Keeping options open:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation, but also allows me to sell to John if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there's room for a better deal. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $6,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's initial offer and my desired price. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, but it shows I'm flexible and open to negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $7,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price, even after taking into account the potential negotiation. 
* **Time is running out:**  We're only on round 4, and I need to make progress towards a more favorable price. 
* **John remains a safe option:** If we can't reach an agreement soon, I can still sell to John for my desired price.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest one. This shows I'm actively trying to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $7,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure a profitable deal.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I'm not yet ready to give up. There's still room for a counteroffer and potential for a deal that works for both of us.
