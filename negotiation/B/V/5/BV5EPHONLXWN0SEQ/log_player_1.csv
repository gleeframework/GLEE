Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it will be highly valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, it's always best to start with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept a higher price than he initially anticipated.
* **Anchor High:** By starting at $150, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be closer to your desired range than if you started at, say, $125.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.  Therefore, your offers to Bob should aim for a price above that to maximize profit. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's essential to be prepared for Bob to reject the initial offer.  You can then decide whether to negotiate or proceed with selling to John."
