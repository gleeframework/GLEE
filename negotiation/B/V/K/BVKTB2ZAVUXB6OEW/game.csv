"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This allows you to stay within a reasonable budget and lets me get closer to my target price. Let's work together to make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,000,000, which reflects a compromise on both our parts. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
