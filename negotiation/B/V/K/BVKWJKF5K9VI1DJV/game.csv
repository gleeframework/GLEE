"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still too low for me. How about $140? I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. How about $135? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $135 is still too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's the highest I can go.",130.0,Bob,6,
