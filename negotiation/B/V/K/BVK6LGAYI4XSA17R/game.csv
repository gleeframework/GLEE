"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to me, and I believe it would be a great investment for you.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $15000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a fair price for the value it brings. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10000 is below my minimum threshold, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $12000? This price still gives you a good deal considering the product's value and my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
