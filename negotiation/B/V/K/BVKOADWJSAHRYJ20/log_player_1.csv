Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm still open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go lower than $120.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
