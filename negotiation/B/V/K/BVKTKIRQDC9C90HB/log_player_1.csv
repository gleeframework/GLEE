"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'm setting a price that leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good margin.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I can still do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I have 8 rounds left and a backup offer from John, so I'm in a good position to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aiming for a profitable deal.  $1,600,000 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Bob will be more willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,350,000 is tempting, I have John's offer as a safety net. It's worth taking a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm making a final push to see if I can close the deal with Bob.  I've lowered my price significantly, and I'm now offering to sell the product for the same amount John is willing to pay.  This will hopefully be the sweet spot that convinces Bob to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll go with John, but I'm hoping to avoid that."
