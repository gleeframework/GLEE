"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit by offering you $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
