{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and Alice seems firm on her current offer.  Accepting her offer at $720,000 will still save me $80,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise and allows me to move forward with acquiring the product."
