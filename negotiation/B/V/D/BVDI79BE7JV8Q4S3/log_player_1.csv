Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $15,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,000 creates a significant profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's a price point that suggests a good deal to Bob (saving him $4,000 from his perceived value) while still netting me $4,000 more than my minimum. 
* **First Offer Psychology:**  By starting with a strong offer, it sets a higher reference point for the negotiation, should Bob try to counter-offer."
