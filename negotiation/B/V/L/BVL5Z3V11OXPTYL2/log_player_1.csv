Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate downwards. I'm also phrasing it in a way that emphasizes the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This would give you a great deal, and still allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,000. How about we meet at $7,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running the risk of going back and forth for a while longer. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
