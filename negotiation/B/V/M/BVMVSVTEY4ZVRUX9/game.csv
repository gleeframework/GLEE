"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your desired profit margin and my budget. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which still allows me a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and represents a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing this discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000.  This price is fair considering your desired profit and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
