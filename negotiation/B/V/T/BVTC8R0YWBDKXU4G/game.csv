"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we value the product at $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of this product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,
