As we value the product at $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of this product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
