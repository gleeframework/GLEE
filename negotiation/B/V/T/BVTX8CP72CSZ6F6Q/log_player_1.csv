Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed backup offer at $15,000, Alice should aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product slightly below John's price provides a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still maximizing Alice's potential profit.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $14,999 appears more appealing and might be perceived as a better deal than a rounded $15,000. 

By starting high, Alice leaves room to potentially negotiate down if Bob shows resistance, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at a minimum price."
