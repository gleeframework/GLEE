"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's significantly below what I consider a fair value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
