"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10000 at this time.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11500, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product. ",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
