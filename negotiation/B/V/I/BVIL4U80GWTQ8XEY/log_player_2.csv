"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95.
* John is selling it for $100.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can get the product from John for the same price you value it at. This is the best option for you as it saves you money compared to Alice's offer."
