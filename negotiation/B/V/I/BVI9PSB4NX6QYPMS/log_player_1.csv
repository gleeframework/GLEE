"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to create room for negotiation.
* **Fair but Firm:** $11,500 is a good starting point as it's less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still allows for potential profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $10,200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,200 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I want to close the deal,  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price. There's always a chance he might be willing to pay more to secure the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By offering $10,800, I'm essentially splitting the difference between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,200). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** The message highlights how this price is ""fair for both of us,"" making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm trying to encourage Bob to accept this offer, as it's getting closer to his budget while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. How about $10,600 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,600 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be cautious about accepting offers that are too far below my desired price. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer if I continue to reject his offers. I'm hoping to push for a price closer to my target.

I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm aware of the time constraint and the option of selling to John for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,600 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,700. This is a final price adjustment I'm willing to make.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Adjustment:**  I'm making a small adjustment, showing I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm close to my limit. 
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm trying to close the deal. 
* **Strong Closing:** I'm framing this as a ""final price adjustment"" to put pressure on Bob to accept, while also emphasizing the desire to ""close this deal."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we're getting closer. How about $10,650 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,650 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's closer than before, it's still not enough for me to consider selling.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to four rounds left, and the time pressure is increasing. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer if I reject this one. 

I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better price. If Bob doesn't come closer to my desired range, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close! I'm going to meet you halfway on this one. How about $10,725 for the product?  This is the very best I can do, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10725}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** With only three rounds left, I'm making a significant compromise by meeting Bob almost halfway. This demonstrates a genuine effort to close the deal.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the ""best I can do"" and the need to ""make this happen."" This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights how this price is ""a great deal for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I believe we can find a common ground. How about $10,680 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,680. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,680
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  With only two rounds remaining, time is running out, and I need to make a decision.
* **Minimum Not Met:** Bob's offer of $10,680 still falls below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Selling to John:** Given the time constraint and the fact that I can sell to John for a significantly higher price ($12,000), it's in my best interest to end negotiations with Bob and sell to John.  While I would have preferred to make a higher profit with Bob, I need to prioritize securing a sale that meets my minimum requirement."
