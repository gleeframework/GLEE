Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit. By offering it at $1,100,000, you leave Bob with a potential $100,000 gain, making it a tempting offer while securing a significant profit for yourself.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there might be back-and-forth negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
