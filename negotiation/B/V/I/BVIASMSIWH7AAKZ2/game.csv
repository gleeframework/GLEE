"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that amount for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your price of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept your offer of $1500000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, which is my final offer. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
