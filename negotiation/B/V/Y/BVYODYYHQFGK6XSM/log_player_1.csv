# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. Given the situation, I would like to stick to my maximum budget of $8,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge beyond his $8,000 limit. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees that I get the product's minimum value and avoids wasting further time."
