"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a good deal for you too. Let's close the deal at this price.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",16500.0,Alice,5,
