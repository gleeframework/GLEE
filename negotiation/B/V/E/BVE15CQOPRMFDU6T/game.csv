Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll be forced to go with John's offer instead.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. While I recognize the product's uniqueness, I'm only able to offer $900000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move forward with John's offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
