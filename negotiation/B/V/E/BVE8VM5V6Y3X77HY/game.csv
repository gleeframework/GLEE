"Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $8,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your needs. Considering the high quality and unique features of this product, I suggest an offer of $10,000. This allows us to reach a compromise that benefits both parties. If this proposal is acceptable, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction.",10000.0,Alice,1,
