Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1,800,000 is significantly below what I believe it's worth.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,950,000. I think that's a fair price for a product of this caliber. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to our desired price range. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $2,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the unique nature and potential of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $2,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. I think that's a fair price for a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for it from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now very close to the halfway point between our initial asking price and his initial offer. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting $1,900,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer, and it's always possible Bob is bluffing about his valuation."
