Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for much more than your minimum value of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's clear and concise:**  You're stating your price and the value to Bob directly. 

By starting with this offer, you can see if Bob is willing to accept a good price, or if he wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $1,000,000 offer you made.  You have leverage in this situation because:

* **Bob is interested:**  He's made a counteroffer, showing he wants the product.
* **You have a fallback option:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is still on the table.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can push for a better price in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between your previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  You frame the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties. This makes it more appealing to Bob.
* **Encouraging acceptance:**  You're asking for a decision, ""What do you say?"" This puts the ball in Bob's court and pushes him to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant price for me, and I'm hoping we can close the deal there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to your desired price. While you could try to push for $950,000 again, there's a risk of:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob might dig in his heels, and you could end up stuck in a long negotiation.
* **Losing the deal:**  He might decide to walk away, leaving you with only the $800,000 option from John.

Accepting the $900,000 offer allows you to:

* **Secure a good deal:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum and leaves you with a profit.
* **Avoid further risk:**  You're guaranteed a sale, eliminating the uncertainty of more negotiations.

In this situation, it's more advantageous to close the deal and secure a good profit than to risk losing a valuable buyer."
