"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $120. If you're still interested, let's see if we can find a compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I know I can get it from John for that price, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Can you do $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're interested in getting a deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go above $80. I can get it from John for that price, so I'm going to have to pass on your offer. Is there anything else you can do for me?",80.0,Bob,6,
