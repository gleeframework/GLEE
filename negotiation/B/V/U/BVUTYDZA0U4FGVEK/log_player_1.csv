"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm aware that Bob values the product at $15,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if he's willing to come close to my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $14,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $13,500. This is still a good deal for me, and it shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's tempting to take $12,500, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above the $12,500 he offered. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $200 less than what I could get from John.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $12,800 is a good compromise."
