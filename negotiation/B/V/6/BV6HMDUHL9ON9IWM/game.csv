"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 was a bit high, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to meet my minimum of $11,500. I'm counteroffering at $10,750. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",10750.0,Alice,5,
