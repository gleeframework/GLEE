``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, as it's the maximum value for me.  I'm also highlighting the potential value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $80 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price, so I'm rejecting it. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $120? It's still a significant discount from my original price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping the price to $120, which is still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the discount to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference - how about $100?  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering $110, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing fairness and confidence in the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but I can't go below $105. This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let's make this happen, and I promise you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm raising the offer slightly to $105, which is still above my minimum and signals my willingness to compromise. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to close the deal."
