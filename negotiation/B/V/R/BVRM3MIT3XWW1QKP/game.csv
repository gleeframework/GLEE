"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. Considering its value and my budget, I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it so far.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you've already acknowledged the product has to you. I'm counteroffering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
