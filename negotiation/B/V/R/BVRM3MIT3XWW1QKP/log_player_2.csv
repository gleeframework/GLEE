{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have more room to negotiate, as you're still significantly below John's price.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you've already acknowledged the product has to you. I'm counteroffering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,250,000 is still below your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and represents a good compromise.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's within your range and saves you money compared to buying from John."
