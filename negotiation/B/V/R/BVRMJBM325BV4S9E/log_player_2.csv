"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I've carefully assessed its value and believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its true worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
