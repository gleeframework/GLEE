I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I think I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
