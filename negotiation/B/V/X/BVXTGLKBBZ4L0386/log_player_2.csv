"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's asking price of $110 and my maximum price of $120. This is a fair compromise and gives Alice a chance to make a small profit while still allowing me to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still closer to her desired price than mine, but it's better than John's $120.  I'll reject the offer and try to counteroffer again. I'm willing to go up to $110 but would like to see if I can squeeze out a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is my maximum price for this product. This is a good compromise, as it's only $5 less than Alice's current offer. Hopefully, she'll accept it, allowing me to save a little more than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.5 is close to my maximum price of $110.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge or that I could end up buying from John for $120. Accepting this offer means I get the product for a price that's within my budget and saves me $7.50 compared to John."
