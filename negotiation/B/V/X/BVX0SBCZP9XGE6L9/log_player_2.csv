Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think $9,000 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $10,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $10500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. I'm trying to save as much money as possible, so I'll try to get closer to the $10,000 price point.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $9,000 and the current market price of $10,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think there's been a mistake! I chose to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, not make another counteroffer. But since I can still make a counteroffer, I'll try to get as close to the $10,000 price point as possible. I'll offer $9,900 for the product.
