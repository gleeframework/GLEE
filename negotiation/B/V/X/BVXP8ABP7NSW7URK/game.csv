"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
