Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still more than Bob's maximum budget.  There is a possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice, or getting a better deal from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to spend. There's a chance he can get a better deal with Alice or buy from John for $8,000."
