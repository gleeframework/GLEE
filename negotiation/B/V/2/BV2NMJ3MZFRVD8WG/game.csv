"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to make this work!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,750 is still below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $9,125. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",9125.0,Alice,5,
