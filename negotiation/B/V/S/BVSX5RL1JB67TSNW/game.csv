"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident you'll agree that this price is fair, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
