Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to him, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **It's not too aggressive:** This avoids scaring Bob off with an unrealistic price right from the start. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent profit, it's still less than our initial offer of $14,000. We want to see if we can push Bob closer to our desired price. We have leverage knowing that we have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can go down to $13,000, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.  This still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Bob's price, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  $13,000 is still significantly above our minimum, and allows for potential further negotiation.
* **Reinforcing Value:** Highlighting the product's value for Bob emphasizes the potential benefit of accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is still less than our initial offer, it's a reasonable compromise.  Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Profit Margin:** We're still earning $2,500 over our minimum acceptable price, which is a good profit.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, especially if he's firm on his price. 
* **Limited Upside:** Further counteroffers might only yield a small increase, potentially not worth the risk of losing the sale.

This offer balances our desire for a higher price with the need to finalize the sale and secure a good profit."
