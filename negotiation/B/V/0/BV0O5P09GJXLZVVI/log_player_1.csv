This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's value ($8,000), leaving room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit.  It's also positive and friendly to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired $8,500."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $7,800? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $7800. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $7400? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and the market. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,400 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm going to counter again and see if I can push for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7400 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $7600? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $7600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7200, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $7200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower and we're getting stuck in a back-and-forth that could go on forever.  I'm not confident I can get significantly higher with further counteroffers, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure this deal and move on."
