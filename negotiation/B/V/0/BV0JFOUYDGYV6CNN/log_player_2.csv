"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product, would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I still think this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $87.50, which is still a good deal for me as it's below my maximum price of $100 and closer to the value I'm willing to pay.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Alice will reject again, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer guarantees I get the product at a reasonable price."
