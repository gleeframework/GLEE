"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is slightly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. ",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. I've given this a lot of thought, and to be completely transparent, $1,350,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably offer.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. I'm prepared to offer $1,375,000 for the product. I believe this represents a fair compromise and allows us to move forward.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and find middle ground. I've tried to approach this negotiation from the same perspective. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,390,000 for the product. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for both of us.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
