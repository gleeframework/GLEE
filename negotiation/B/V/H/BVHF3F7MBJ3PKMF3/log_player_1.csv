{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), but I'm willing to negotiate.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, this offer is within his range while still providing me with a substantial profit. I'll be ready to adjust the price depending on his response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,050,000. How about $990,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to secure a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price that balances our needs and interests."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $990,000 is still not workable for me.  Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to being comfortable with the price, but I'm still a bit short. How about $1,015,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm not comfortable settling for a price this low. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
