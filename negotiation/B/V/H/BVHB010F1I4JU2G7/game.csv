"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering its value to me and allows for a healthy profit margin for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you while also being a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle. How about $875,000? This price reflects the value to me and allows for a solid profit for you.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $885,000. This price is getting closer to your target, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",885000.0,Alice,5,
