Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you while also being a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle. How about $875,000? This price reflects the value to me and allows for a solid profit for you.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $885,000. This price is getting closer to your target, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to your ideal price of $850,000.  You've already rejected several offers, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only push the price back up.  It's more beneficial to accept this offer and avoid potentially wasting more time and risking a higher price."
