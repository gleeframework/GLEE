Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this to be a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room to maneuver and might lead Bob to counter with a figure closer to your acceptable range. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial high offer will help you assess how eager Bob is to purchase. His reaction will provide valuable insight for your next move.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John) gives you leverage. You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly closer to his valuation ($1,200,000) than yours ($1,500,000+). There's room for negotiation.
* By rejecting, you signal that you believe the product is worth more.
* You're not in a rush. John's offer provides a safety net, allowing you to negotiate strategically with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you're serious about this purchase, the product's value is truly significant. I could consider letting it go for $1,850,000.  This reflects the worth it brings."", ""product_price"": 1850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer but in a substantial chunk ($150,000). This signals willingness to negotiate but also firmness on the product's value.
* **Midpoint Pressure:**  This counteroffer puts the price roughly halfway between your last offer and his. It subtly frames this as a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You're still significantly above John's $1,500,000 offer, keeping that as a fallback option if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,700,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Commitment:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating strong interest and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments. Holding out risks pushing Bob away completely, forcing you to accept John's lower offer. 

It's often better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially small gain later."
