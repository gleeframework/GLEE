,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $8,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value I perceive the product to be worth.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is closer to your offer and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value I perceive the product to be worth.",8800.0,Bob,6,
