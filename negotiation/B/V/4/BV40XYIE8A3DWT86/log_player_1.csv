Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm willing to negotiate with Bob a bit more, as $7,500 is still above my minimum. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but above his."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a little bit to $8,500.  This is still a fair price considering the quality of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to give up more than $1,000 on my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has repeatedly offered a price below my minimum. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll sell the product to John for $8,000 to secure a guaranteed deal above my minimum."
