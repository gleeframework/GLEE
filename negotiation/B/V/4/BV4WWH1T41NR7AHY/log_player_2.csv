"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer a bit below your target price to allow room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message aims to maintain a positive tone and express continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. There's room for further negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle on $10,750?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($11,000) and our previous counteroffer ($10,500). 
* **Sense of Fairness:** The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Approaching the Limit:** We're getting closer to John's backup offer ($12,000), so we need to be mindful of how much further we're willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go much lower. Her final offer of $11,250 is only a $750 difference from John's guaranteed price of $12,000. At this point, it makes more sense to buy from John to:

* **Guarantee the Purchase:**  Continuing negotiations with Alice carries the risk she won't budge, and we'll lose out on the product entirely.
* **Save Time and Effort:**  Further haggling may not yield significant savings and could be time-consuming. 
* **Minimize Risk:** There's always a small chance something could go wrong in a prolonged negotiation (misunderstanding, Alice walking away, etc.). John represents a certain and reliable alternative."
