"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am prepared to consider offers. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I believe we can come to an arrangement that is mutually beneficial. Considering its market value and your potential appreciation for it, I kindly propose a price of $950,000. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than your absolute ceiling of $1,200,000 and leaves little room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or resorting to buying from John at your maximum budget."
