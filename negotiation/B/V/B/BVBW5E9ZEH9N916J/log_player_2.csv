"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120 from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting the offer at $105 is a good compromise. This saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting and requiring further rounds, or ultimately losing the deal altogether, is not worth the potential for a few dollars more savings."
