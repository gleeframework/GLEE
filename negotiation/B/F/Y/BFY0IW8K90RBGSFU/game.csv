,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me is only $1,500,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1520000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,520,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still just a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,530,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1530000.0,Bob,6,
