"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $950,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was asking. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
