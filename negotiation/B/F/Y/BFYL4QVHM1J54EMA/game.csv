"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $600000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $550000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,
