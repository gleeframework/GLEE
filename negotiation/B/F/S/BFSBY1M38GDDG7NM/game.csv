"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $105?  This would still give us both a fair deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $105, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? That's my final offer.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $101.25?  It's closer to your offer, but still allows us to both get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, I'm not willing to go above $97.50. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value is only $150 to you. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $97.50",97.5,Bob,6,
