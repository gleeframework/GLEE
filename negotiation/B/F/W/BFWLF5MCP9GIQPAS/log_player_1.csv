Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,190,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,190,000 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob. 
* **Backup Offer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so we can afford to be slightly more ambitious with Bob.

This strategy aims to find a price that's beneficial for both parties, while prioritizing a profitable outcome for Alice."
