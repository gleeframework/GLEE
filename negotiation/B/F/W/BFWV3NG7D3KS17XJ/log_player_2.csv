Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.** Even though it's only $5,000 above, Bob is already at the limit of what he's willing to spend.
* **There's no guarantee Alice will budge further.**  She's stated it's her final offer.  
* **John offers a guaranteed price.**  Bob knows he can buy the product for $800,000 from John without any further negotiation. 

While $980,000 is a good price, Bob would be risking potentially losing the deal with Alice and being stuck with a higher price than he'd originally planned.  It's more secure to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
