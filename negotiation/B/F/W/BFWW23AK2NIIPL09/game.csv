"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while still being mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
