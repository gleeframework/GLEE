"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1200000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is the same price John is offering, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.
