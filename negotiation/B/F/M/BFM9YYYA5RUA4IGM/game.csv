"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to get a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,000,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,020,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1020000.0,Bob,4,
