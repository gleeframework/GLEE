Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
