"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate with you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,000? This is my final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for a higher price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
