"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that I believe will be invaluable to your business. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its incredible value.  Let's discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to hype the product's value, the offer of $1,150,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
