"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $900,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying. Can we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $975,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's aim for $1,050,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $975,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product holds. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher.",975000.0,Bob,6,
