Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position. It gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it signals to him that the product is valuable. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum of $800,000 and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $875,000 is a decent price and I'm not sure I can get more from Bob. Selling to John would only net me $800,000, so this is the better option."
