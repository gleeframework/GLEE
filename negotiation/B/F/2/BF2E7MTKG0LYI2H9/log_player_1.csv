Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a lot to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more motivated to reach a deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, indicating I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my next offer accordingly.
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll keep the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While it's a decent starting point,  $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still secure a better price than Bob's offer. There's a clear gap between our valuations, and I'm confident I can bridge some of that.
* **Avoiding Premature Sell:** Selling to John now for $1,000,000 would mean missing out on the potential to get closer to the product's value to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product to your business. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm flexible but also serious about getting a reasonable price.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to his business, hoping to incentivize him to accept a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly and productive.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If he rejects again, I'll carefully consider my options: a further counteroffer, selling to John, or ending the negotiation."
