"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Would you be willing to consider that?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. I'm willing to come down to $112.50, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
