This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than what it's worth to me.  This allows for some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still quite high.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This offer is still well within the value I see in the product, and it allows us to potentially reach a deal. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.

While I'm still not happy with Bob's offer, I'm going to make one more counteroffer. It seems like he's willing to negotiate and I might be able to get a better price than his current offer."

If you're serious about acquiring this, let's finalize this deal at $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it demonstrates my sincerity in wanting to make this deal work. It's a fair price that considers both our needs, and I hope we can find common ground at this point.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, it seems like he's not willing to budge much further.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a price closer to my target. To guarantee a sale that meets my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
