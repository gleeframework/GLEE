"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it's worth that much to you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so paying $10,500 to Alice would be a worse deal."
