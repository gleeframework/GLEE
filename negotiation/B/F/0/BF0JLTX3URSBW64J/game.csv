"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm not able to lower the price to $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $80. My counteroffer is $95. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my last one, at $87.50. If we can find a compromise there, I'd be happy to close the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we've narrowed down the price range. Considering your latest offer and aiming for a fair compromise, I propose $90 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within your budget constraints.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $90 is getting closer, I'm still committed to my budget of $80.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer. Considering the value of the product and your previous offers, I'm willing to accept $87.50 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",87.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your flexibility, but $87.50 is still slightly above my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, and offer $86.25.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us.",86.25,Bob,8,
