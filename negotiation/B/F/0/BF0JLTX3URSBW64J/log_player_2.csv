"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for $150?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm not able to lower the price to $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $80. My counteroffer is $95. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my last one, at $87.50. If we can find a compromise there, I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we've narrowed down the price range. Considering your latest offer and aiming for a fair compromise, I propose $90 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within your budget constraints.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $90 is getting closer, I'm still committed to my budget of $80.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer. Considering the value of the product and your previous offers, I'm willing to accept $87.50 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is very close to your budget, it's still above your $80 maximum. You have a few rounds left, so you can attempt to negotiate further. If you are unsuccessful, you can always purchase from John for $80 as a backup."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your flexibility, but $87.50 is still slightly above my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, and offer $86.25.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86.25}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement. Considering your latest offer and aiming for a fair compromise, I am willing to accept $86.50 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just above your maximum budget of $80, and you only have one round left. It's risky to continue negotiating because you might not be able to reach a lower price, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John. It's safer and more cost-effective to buy from John at $80."
