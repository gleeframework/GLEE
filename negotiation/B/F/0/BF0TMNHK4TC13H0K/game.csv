"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. $9,200 is still a bit higher than what I'm aiming for.  How about $9,100?  That's a reasonable compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close! I can do $9,150, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a deal with you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. What do you think?",9150.0,Alice,5,
