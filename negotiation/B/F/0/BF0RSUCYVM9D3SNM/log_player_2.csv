"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's potential to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so you're in a good position to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000 establishes a clear expectation that you're aiming for a much lower price. This gives Alice a starting point for negotiation and encourages her to consider a lower price if she wants to close the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, it's still more than half your initial counteroffer. You have several rounds left and the option to buy from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer was a substantial move closer to your initial counteroffer.  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but are still seeking a deal closer to your target price. It also allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has now moved to $1,150,000, which is only $50,000 away from your last counteroffer. It's likely we're nearing a point where Alice may not be willing to budge further.  Given that you have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, accepting this offer will save you $350,000.  It's a good deal, and it's better to secure the product than risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
