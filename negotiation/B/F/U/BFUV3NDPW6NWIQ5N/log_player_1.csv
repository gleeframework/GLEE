"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strategic move. It sets a high initial expectation and leaves room for negotiation.  While Bob may reject this initial offer, it's important to establish a starting point that reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to sell at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a value above my minimum. It's likely Bob will either accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with this price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500.  This is a significant step down from my previous offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and accept this price.  If he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreeable price.  It's better to secure the $8,000 from John than risk losing everything by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
