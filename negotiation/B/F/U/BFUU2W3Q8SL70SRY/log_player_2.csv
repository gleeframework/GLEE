"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price lower than its true value to you, and I'll get a fair price for something I value highly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
