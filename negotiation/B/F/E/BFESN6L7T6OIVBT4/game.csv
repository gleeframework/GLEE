"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to the original value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200. It's a small step up, but I think it's still a fair deal. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
