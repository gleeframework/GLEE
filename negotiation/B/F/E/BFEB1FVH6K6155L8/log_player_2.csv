"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9500 for it. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product and your interest in it. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still more than the product's worth to Bob. He can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John to potentially get a lower price."
