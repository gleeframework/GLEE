# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think?

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still looking for a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $850,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's clear she's aiming for a price well above your $800,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice when you have a sure thing with John."
