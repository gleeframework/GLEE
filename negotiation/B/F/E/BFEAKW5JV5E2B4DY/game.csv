"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're still looking for a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $850,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
