"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $12500? I think it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $10000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy the product right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
