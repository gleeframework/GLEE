You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer of $95 is a good deal. However, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  He's offering $85, which is still a good deal for him, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get closer to his target price of $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to get the best deal possible while still showing a willingness to compromise. He's increased his offer slightly from $85 to $88, showing that he's willing to move a little bit, but still keeping the pressure on Alice to come down in price.  He's still well below his maximum price of $120, so there's still room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $85.  While $92 is still a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob can likely get it for closer to $90 with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push to get a price he is comfortable with. He is raising his offer to $90, which is closer to Alice's offer and shows a willingness to meet halfway. This counteroffer is a good compromise as it's still a good deal for him, but it also gives Alice a sense that Bob is serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $94 is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $120. With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's still within his budget, and he avoids the risk of Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
