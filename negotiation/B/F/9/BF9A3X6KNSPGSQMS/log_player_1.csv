Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is well above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but also lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the discount and emphasizing a fair price.  This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a middle ground. I want to maximize my profit while still making the offer appealing enough for Bob to consider.  This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation, allowing me to adjust my price depending on Bob's response. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't reach a satisfactory point for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to consider his offer, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll make a counteroffer.  I'll aim to meet him halfway, but I'll still be firm on my bottom line.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,250,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a significant discount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,250,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while remaining firm on my desire for a fair price. I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise, encouraging Bob to see the value in accepting.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as it's a significant discount from my initial offer and a substantial premium for him. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000, as it's becoming increasingly unlikely I'll get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.  I've already made several concessions, and it's unlikely Bob will come up much higher. 

**Why Sell to John:**

Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures that I get my minimum acceptable price and maximize my profit. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, continuing negotiations with him is unlikely to yield a better result.

**Conclusion:**

It's time to cut my losses and move on.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making him the best option in this situation."
