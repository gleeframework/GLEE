"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,250,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a significant discount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
