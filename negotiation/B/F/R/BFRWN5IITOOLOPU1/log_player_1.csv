Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

While holding out for a higher price is tempting, Bob's offer of $950,000 is substantial and significantly above John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away, and there's no guarantee of reaching a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale."
