"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is $12,000. It's in your best interest to try to get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  Alice may counter, but I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't come closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still within my acceptable range of $15,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my next offer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now."
