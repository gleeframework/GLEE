"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than $1,200,000.  It offers unique advantages that justify a premium price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. While I recognize the product's unique qualities, I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems anchored at $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to take the sure $1,200,000, there's still room to negotiate.  I'll try to push him a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident that the value this product brings to your specific needs is worth more than your current offer. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing  $1,450,000. This offer demonstrates my willingness to be flexible while still reflecting the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally moved significantly from his $1,200,000 anchor point. While we could try to push for more, getting to $1,300,000 is a good deal. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or us having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer in later rounds."
