"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than $1,200,000.  It offers unique advantages that justify a premium price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. While I recognize the product's unique qualities, I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident that the value this product brings to your specific needs is worth more than your current offer. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing  $1,450,000. This offer demonstrates my willingness to be flexible while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
