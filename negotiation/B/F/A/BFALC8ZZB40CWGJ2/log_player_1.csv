{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount for you and a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I don't immediately drop to his price. 
* The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to foster a positive and open negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price between $12,000 and $15,000. I'll be willing to negotiate a bit, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer. 
* **I'm not willing to accept a price that low.** I would be leaving a lot of money on the table, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. My goal is to find a middle ground between $12,000 and $15,000. I'll use the rejection to show Bob I'm serious about my asking price and am not desperate for a quick sale."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I've raised the price to $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Message:**  I've maintained a friendly tone and emphasized that I'm still looking for a compromise. I've also reminded Bob of the value of the product and that my offer is still a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price in the middle, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a firm stance on my bottom line. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value in my offer and accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he continues to push for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,750. Can we compromise on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's a slight increase, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **I'm not willing to compromise my financial goals.**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be more patient and wait for a better offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer,  aiming for a price closer to my desired value. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John.  This strategy ensures I don't settle for an unacceptable price and leaves room for a successful negotiation without compromising my financial goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too far from what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to move on to other interested buyers.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making my final counteroffer at $10,000. This price is still above Bob's last offer but closer to his budget, signaling my willingness to negotiate while also remaining firm about my desired value.
* **Message:**  The message is direct and assertive, communicating that this is my final offer and leaves the decision in Bob's hands. 
* **Pressure:** I've subtly pressured Bob by mentioning other interested buyers, emphasizing that I have options and am not desperate for a sale. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my last attempt to secure a deal with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with.  If he rejects, I'll proceed with the guaranteed sale to John, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $9,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Please consider my offer.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** Despite his willingness to meet halfway again, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **I'm not willing to further compromise my financial goals.**  At this point, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my desired price.

**Strategy:**

*  I've made it clear through my previous counteroffers that I'm open to negotiation, but I've also established my minimum acceptable price.  By choosing to sell to John, I'm securing my desired profit and avoiding a potentially drawn-out negotiation that might not result in a favorable outcome."
