"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount for you and a good price for me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,750. Can we compromise on that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too far from what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to move on to other interested buyers.  Let me know what you decide.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $9,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Please consider my offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
