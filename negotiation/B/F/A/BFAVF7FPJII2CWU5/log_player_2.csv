# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $10,000 is less than $12,000.
* **You still save money:**  You're getting the product for $10,000, which is more than the product's value to Alice ($8,000), but less than your maximum budget ($12,000)."
