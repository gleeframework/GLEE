"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the offer of $12,000 is more than Alice values the product for, it's significantly less than your maximum price of $15,000 and the guaranteed price from John. Accepting this offer represents a good deal for you."
