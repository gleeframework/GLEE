To ensure both parties benefit, I propose selling the product to you for $95. This price not only reflects the product's true worth but also allows us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer means Bob can negotiate with John, potentially getting a lower price, or simply buying from John at $100, which is still within his budget."
