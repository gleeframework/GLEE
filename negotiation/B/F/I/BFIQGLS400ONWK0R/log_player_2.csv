"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still leaving some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above my budget, even though it's lower than her initial offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I have enough rounds left to try and reach a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,750. This is still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above my budget, and we're running out of rounds.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll drop to my desired price.  To avoid the risk of the negotiation falling apart, it's more prudent to secure the product from John at a guaranteed price of $10,000."
