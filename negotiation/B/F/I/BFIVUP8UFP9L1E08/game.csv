"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $165.",165.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with $162. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise at $158. Can you consider that?",158.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $158, but I can see you're really interested in the product. I'll make one more counteroffer: $164. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",164.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $160, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'll make one more counteroffer: $165, but I'm only willing to go this low because I think the product is really worth it to you. This is my final offer.",165.0,Alice,9,
