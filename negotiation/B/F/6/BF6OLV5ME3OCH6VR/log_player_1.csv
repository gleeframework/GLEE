{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point. It's a little lower than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to get as close to my minimum price of $120 as possible, but I'm also willing to close the deal at $100 rather than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not desperate for a sale and John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a fair offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Strategy:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum price of $120 as possible. This counteroffer feels like a reasonable compromise and increases the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm still not willing to sell at that price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with one more counteroffer. I'm also not desperate for a sale and John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $93, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $93, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It's still a bit above my minimum, but I'm pushing it as far as I'm comfortable going.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the value of the product. I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer.
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to get as close to my minimum price of $120 as possible.  I believe this offer is a good balance between getting a reasonable price and avoiding further negotiations. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $93 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $88 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, I've reached my limit for negotiation.  I've already countered several times and made concessions.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially considering the possibility of his counteroffers dropping below my minimum.  Selling to John is the best and safest option to guarantee my minimum profit."
