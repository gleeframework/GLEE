# Alice's message: Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. While Alice's message uses sales tactics, the bottom line is the price is favorable for you."
