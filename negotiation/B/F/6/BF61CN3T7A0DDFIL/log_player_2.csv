"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit you. Considering its worth, I propose a price of $11,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should attempt to get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've highlighted, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to establish a starting point for negotiation.  Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial proposal, but it's still within a reasonable range considering his maximum budget of $12,000 and Alice's desired $10,000. This aggressive counteroffer shows Bob's serious intent to negotiate while also leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This price reflects its value while remaining within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price range, there's still room for improvement. Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a better price.  He can potentially push for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $9,500.  He should see if Alice is willing to budge further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his ideal price range. This counteroffer is a small step up from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It also positions Bob as a serious buyer who is ready to finalize the deal. By offering $10,000, Bob shows that he's willing to pay a fair price for the product without exceeding his budget."
