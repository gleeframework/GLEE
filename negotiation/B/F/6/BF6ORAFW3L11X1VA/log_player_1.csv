"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's only slightly lower than selling to John, and we're already in round 4.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
