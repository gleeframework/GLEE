"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000). I'm aiming for a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still making a profit. 

This is a risky move, as it might lead to a quick rejection from Bob. However, it allows me to establish a higher starting point and see if I can incentivize him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, even though the deal with John is an option.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I believe I can still get a better price with continued negotiation.  There are still several rounds left, so I'm not ready to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal.  By making a counteroffer, I'm showing that I'm engaged in the negotiation and willing to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'm running out of rounds, but I believe I can still get a better price with continued negotiation.  Selling to John is still a viable option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a significant concession here, lowering my price to almost my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm doing this because I'm running out of rounds and I need to close the deal quickly. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price than Bob's last offer.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the time for further negotiation is running out.  Bob's latest offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell for less.  While I could make another counteroffer, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement in just one round is slim.  Therefore, the best course of action is to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I meet my minimum target price."
