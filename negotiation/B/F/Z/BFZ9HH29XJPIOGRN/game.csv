"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $12,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $10,000? I feel that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the upper end of your budget. How about $11,500? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
