Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not quite there yet.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at $11,500 and seems unwilling to budge.  At this point, with only one round left, it's highly unlikely she'll drop down to a price close enough to John's offer of $8,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price."
