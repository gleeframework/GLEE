"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.  What are your thoughts?
