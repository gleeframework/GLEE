**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this will prompt Alice to come down a bit."
