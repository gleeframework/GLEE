"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $80.  Would that price work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $140? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $140 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $95? That's a price I'm comfortable with.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $125? It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair value for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
