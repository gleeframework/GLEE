"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and what John offers ($100).  It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to a price you're willing to pay on the first try.  You should make a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $80.  Would that price work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Appear Reasonable:** While $80 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it shows you're serious about purchasing while leaving the possibility of meeting in the middle. 
* **Maintain Communication:**  A polite and clear message helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $140? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $140 is still significantly higher than your $100 budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $140 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $95? That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Instead of a large jump from $80, offering $95 shows willingness to compromise while moving closer to your limit.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes your budget constraints but remains polite and open to reaching an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By staying under $100, you maintain the option of going with John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $125? It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $125.  It's clear that she's trying to find a price above your maximum budget.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's not worth the risk.  You can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum budget and a guaranteed saving."
