Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it at this time.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my own financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm prepared to buy the product from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob is signaling he won't budge from his $1,000,000 offer, even using John as leverage.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable to me. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best way to ensure I get the product's minimum value."
