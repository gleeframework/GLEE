"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it at this time.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my own financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm prepared to buy the product from John instead.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
