Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **My Minimum:**  I need at least $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net.

By offering $1,150,000, I aim to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Get closer to Bob's perceived value while still achieving a significant profit.
* **Reduce Risk:**  The offer is attractive enough to incentivize Bob to accept, but still allows me to sell to John if he rejects."
