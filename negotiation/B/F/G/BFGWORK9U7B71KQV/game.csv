"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is below what I can realistically accept. Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $775,000 isn't quite there yet. We've both made concessions, and to make this deal work, I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get close to my target, but $825,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $825,000, which is $800,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,6,
