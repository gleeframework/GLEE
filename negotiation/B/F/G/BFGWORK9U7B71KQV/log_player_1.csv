"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is $100,000 above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $900,000 isn't my absolute maximum, so I can still come down if necessary. 
* **Establishing value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, hinting at the potential for a higher price.

This strategy is designed to:

* **Get the best possible price:** While $900,000 is ambitious, it's a good starting point to maximize my earnings.
* **Test the waters:** Bob's response will give me insights into his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain control:** By starting the negotiation, I set the tone and control the initial flow of the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While I want to close the deal, accepting such a low offer would be a major loss. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price. I believe there is still room for a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is below what I can realistically accept. Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profitable sale.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's worth to justify the price, reminding Bob of the potential benefits of owning it.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum, indicating I'm not desperate for a quick sale and have confidence in the product's value.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Encourage a deal:** By showing willingness to compromise, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Set a reasonable expectation:** $850,000 is a fair price that allows both parties to gain.
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:** I'm actively engaging with Bob and demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $775,000 isn't quite there yet. We've both made concessions, and to make this deal work, I need to be closer to my target.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get close to my target, but $825,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $825,000, which is $800,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.

* **Mutual benefit:** This is a fair deal for both of us.  I get my minimum price, and Bob gets the product for his perceived value.
