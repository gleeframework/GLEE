Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my earnings.  I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing a sale and having to settle with John for $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit."
