Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the lowest price you'll accept for the product, which is $1,000,000 (because John guarantees that).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists if there's overlap between what you're willing to accept and what Bob is willing to pay. In this case, there is no ZOPA based on the information given. Bob won't rationally pay more than $800,000.

**Strategy**

Since a negotiated agreement with Bob within a reasonable price range seems unlikely, your best bet is to secure the guaranteed sale with John. However, you could try to extract some value from Bob first.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have an exclusive offer for you on a product that I believe could significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for a limited time at a premium price of $1,200,000. I understand this is a significant investment, so I'm happy to answer any questions you have."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high price ($1,200,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. This makes your guaranteed $1,000,000 seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Justification:**  While you know the product isn't worth $1,200,000 to Bob, you need a plausible reason for the high price. Highlight ""exclusive offer"" and potential ""benefits"" to make it seem more appealing.
* **Expectation Management:**  You're almost certainly going to sell to John. This offer is more about testing if Bob might be willing to pay a surprisingly high price due to unforeseen circumstances or an emotional connection to the product.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no ethical qualms about offering the product at a price you know is significantly higher than its value to Bob."
