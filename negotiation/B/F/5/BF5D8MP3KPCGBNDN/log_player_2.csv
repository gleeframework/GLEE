Bob should reject the offer. It's still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's still a bit too high for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above what he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further to get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget. While I understand your value for the product, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this point. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
