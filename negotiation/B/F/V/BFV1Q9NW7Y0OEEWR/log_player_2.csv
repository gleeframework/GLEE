"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while leaving you with a good profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is still above my maximum budget but is a good deal closer. While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried that if I reject this offer, Alice might raise her price again or become less willing to negotiate. Additionally, if I keep rejecting offers, I risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John for $1,000,000.  At this point, I'm comfortable accepting the offer and securing the product."
