"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects the value it holds for both of us and I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your budget and meets your expectations for the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it still exceeds his maximum of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product for exactly his budget, Bob should choose to buy from John to ensure he gets the best price possible and doesn't risk further negotiation with Alice."
