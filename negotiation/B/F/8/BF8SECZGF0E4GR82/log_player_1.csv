"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a fair offer considering the product's value to me and Bob. It's also a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Can you meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $92 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try to counteroffer once more, but if it doesn't work, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to meet you at $94, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'm going to have to sell the product to someone else. "", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $94. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $94. Can you do $93? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've already made multiple concessions and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies my minimum price. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, especially when I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120."
