"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's a fair offer considering the current market.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
