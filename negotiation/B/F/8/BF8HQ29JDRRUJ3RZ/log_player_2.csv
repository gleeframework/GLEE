"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its inherent value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic. By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, we establish a negotiating range with room to move upwards.
* **Not Insultingly Low:**  While we want to start low, going too low (like $100,000) could offend Alice and make her less likely to negotiate. $600,000 is a significant difference, but it still demonstrates a serious interest in the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is important. We want to appear flexible and willing to negotiate to encourage Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her final offer. This is likely not truly her final offer, and she's trying to pressure us into accepting.
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $1,400,000 is lower, we're still significantly above our target.  There's a good chance we can get Alice to come down further, especially since she moved by $400,000 from her previous offer. 
* **John as Backup:** We still have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so we're not desperate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Counter:**  Alice is trying to play hardball. We're countering by going directly to our maximum budget. This shows we're serious but not willing to budge further. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  By mentioning ""current market,"" we're implying that we have other options and this is a reasonable offer based on market conditions (even though we might not).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation. There's a chance Alice will walk away, but there's also a good chance she'll accept our offer, saving us a significant amount."
