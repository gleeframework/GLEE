Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation, followed by the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA â€“ John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000. This gives you significant leverage.
* **Bob's Perspective:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He gains value only if he can buy it for less than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's maximum) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave some room for negotiation to make Bob feel like he's getting a deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The $1,400,000 starting point is aggressive but justifiable given your BATNA.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" subtly anchoring the discussion around benefits rather than just price.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  While high, the offer leaves some wiggle room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's still very favorable to you. 
* **Confident Tone:** You project confidence in the product's worth, reinforcing its value in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** Be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate within a range close to your $1,500,000 minimum. Remember, John's offer is a guaranteed win."
