"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open."
