"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, showing that I'm flexible and willing to work with him. 
* **Time Limit Awareness:**  Since I have 10 rounds, I want to start strong and get a good price quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and even below my initial offer of $14,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested, and he's willing to negotiate. This suggests that there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Time to Counter:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me enough time to counter Bob's offer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value.

**Next steps:**  I'll need to make a counteroffer that's higher than $11,500 but still lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows us to reach a compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $14,000 to $13,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that $13,000 is still a good deal for him, especially considering the product's value to him.
* **Moderate Counter:** I'm not dropping the price too much, ensuring I still get a reasonable price for the product.  
* **Time Management:**  I have 7 rounds left, so I need to strike a balance between being flexible and protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to try to get closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $12,800 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Loss:** If I keep rejecting offers, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John for $15,000, which would be a loss for me.
* **Limited Rounds:** I only have 6 rounds remaining, and the negotiations seem to be nearing an end. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Next Steps:** While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid potential losses."
