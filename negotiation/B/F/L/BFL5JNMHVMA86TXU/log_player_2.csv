Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both parties. My initial offer is $1100000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1050000? This would still be a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
