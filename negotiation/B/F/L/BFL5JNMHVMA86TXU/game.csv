"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both parties. My initial offer is $1100000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1050000? This would still be a good price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1050000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1000000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
