"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we meet at $1,025,000? This would allow us to move forward with the transaction while keeping it fair for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
