"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could we bring the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $10,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I see your point, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and profit margins. How about we meet at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit much for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500. However, I've already made some concessions, and I need to make sure I get a good price for this. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest price I can go. If you're still interested, let's do it!",12000.0,Alice,7,
