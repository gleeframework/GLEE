Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $10,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and profit margins. How about we meet at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500. However, I've already made some concessions, and I need to make sure I get a good price for this. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest price I can go. If you're still interested, let's do it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $12,000.  It's clear she won't go any lower.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes the most financial sense to do that and save the extra $2,000."
