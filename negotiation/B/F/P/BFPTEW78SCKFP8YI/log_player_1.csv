"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Show Confidence:** A strong opening offer demonstrates the value you place on your product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states willingness to discuss the price, indicating flexibility.

By starting significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, this strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to determine his price sensitivity.
3. **Leave Room for Concessions:** Allow for strategic price reductions in later rounds. 

Keep in mind, we have the safety net of John's offer ($1,500,000), which provides leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below our initial ask and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. We started high to create room for negotiation, and Bob's counteroffer indicates a willingness to engage in that process. 

By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and are prepared to negotiate further to reach a more favorable agreement. We'll aim to meet somewhere between our current positions in the next round.  

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is our fallback option, and we're not there yet. We have room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach often feels fair and reasonable to both parties, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down $100,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Target:**  This price keeps us well above both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price, maximizing potential profit.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Maintain Momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward by offering a tangible compromise.
2. **Test Bob's Limit:**  Gauge how close Bob is willing to come to our desired price range.
3. **Leave Room for Maneuvering:**  We can still adjust our price slightly in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we still have room to negotiate. He's clearly interested in the product and is willing to bargain. We're not ready to settle just yet, especially since we have John's offer as a safety net. By rejecting, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and encourage Bob to increase his offer.

It's important to note that we're entering a more critical stage of the negotiation. We need to carefully consider our counteroffers to avoid pushing Bob away while still striving for the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're seeking a fair deal. Let's find a compromise. How about $1,825,000? This demonstrates my willingness to move while acknowledging the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down in smaller increments now ($75,000), signaling we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Odd Number:**  The specific amount ($1,825,000) might seem more considered and less like a round number easily moved away from.
* **Balance:** This price point attempts to balance achieving a price significantly above our minimum while still being potentially agreeable to Bob. 

We're nearing a decision point. The next round or two will likely determine whether we reach an agreement with Bob or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While we could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, especially as we've been negotiating for several rounds. 

Here's why accepting now makes sense:

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,750,000 represents a $250,000 gain over our minimum and a reasonable compromise from our initial ask.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob withdrawing, leaving us with John's lower offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we receive the funds sooner.

While there's always a chance we could squeeze out a bit more, the current offer is strong enough to justify accepting and securing a favorable outcome."
