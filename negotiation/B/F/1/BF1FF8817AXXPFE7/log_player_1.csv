Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the value it brings will be worth it. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **Message:** I emphasize the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, without revealing too much about its specifics. This is designed to pique his interest and encourage him to ask for more information. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  By starting high, I create a sense of value and leave room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing a substantial profit."
