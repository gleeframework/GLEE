"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to gain something from this transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value for the product, while still being reasonable for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $920,000.",920000.0,Alice,3,
