"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to gain something from this transaction. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value for the product, while still being reasonable for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $920,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price that Bob is comfortable with. Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 and secure the purchase within his budget."
