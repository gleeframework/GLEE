"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a steal considering its value to you, and it's priced well above my minimum. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. That's the highest I'm willing to go for now.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $8,800?  It's still a great price for a product that's worth significantly more to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8800.0,Alice,3,
