"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price, and $950,000 is still closer to John's price than his ideal.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $900,000 is a good compromise, significantly lower than John's price and still provides Alice with a good profit. Further negotiation could potentially lower the price, but it's risky as it could lead to Alice rejecting and Bob having to buy from John."
