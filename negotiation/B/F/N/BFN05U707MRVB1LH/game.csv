"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
