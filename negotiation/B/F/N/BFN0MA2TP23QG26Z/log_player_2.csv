"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal, but I can likely do better. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000. I'm confident this product is valuable to me, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential for a better deal doesn't outweigh the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and leaving me with John's higher price."
