Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly more than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the potential value and benefits for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  This offer provides a starting point for negotiations, allowing me to adjust if needed.  

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* If Bob accepts the offer, I'll be happy to finalize the sale.
* If negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not making progress, I'll have the option to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It would be a huge financial loss for me. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob. 
* **Counter-offering:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price, hopefully finding a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a good value for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still much higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also ensures I'm not sacrificing too much.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the value for Bob while also framing the offer as a compromise to facilitate agreement.
* **Open to further discussion:**  The message keeps the door open for more negotiation, implying flexibility without completely caving to Bob's demands.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and weigh whether to accept, make a further counteroffer, or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $725,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. Accepting this offer would result in a considerable financial loss. 
* **Counter-offering to find common ground:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. There is still room for compromise.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum desired profit, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll likely offer a price slightly above Bob's offer, but below my initial counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. How about we split the difference and settle on $787,500? This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $787,500 is the exact middle ground between my last offer ($850,000) and Bob's current offer ($725,000). This shows a willingness to compromise without significantly reducing my profits.
* **Positive framing:** I highlight the ""fair compromise"" and ""good deal"" aspects, emphasizing the benefit for both parties.
* **Urgency and finality:**  The message subtly implies that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to take it seriously.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to carefully consider my options. Selling to John for $1,200,000 becomes more appealing at this point, as further negotiation might be unproductive."
