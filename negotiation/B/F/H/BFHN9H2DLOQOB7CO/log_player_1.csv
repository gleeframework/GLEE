Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $95, you're aiming to capture the maximum possible profit ($15) while still ensuring Bob has an incentive to buy ($5 profit for him). 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential gain while making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
