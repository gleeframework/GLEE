Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He should try to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to his target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget, and he can get the product for a lower price from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice since it's unlikely she'll go lower than her current offer."
