"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",12200.0,Alice,5,
