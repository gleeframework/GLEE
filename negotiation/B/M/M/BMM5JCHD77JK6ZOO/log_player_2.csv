# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my target price, but still too high for me. I would like to make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.
