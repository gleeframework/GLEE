"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth even more in the future. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I think your product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to make this deal work.  This price still gives you a significant profit potential, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,180,000?",1180000.0,Bob,6,
