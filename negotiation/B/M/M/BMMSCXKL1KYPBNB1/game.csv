"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to achieve a fair price. Let's work together to make this happen.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my financial limitations.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, and I'm willing to make one final adjustment to see if we can find a solution.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $13,000. This represents a considerable discount from my initial offer, and it's the closest I can go while still getting a fair price for this valuable product. I truly believe this is a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500? This would allow me to get the product I need while still respecting your need for a fair price.",12500.0,Bob,6,
