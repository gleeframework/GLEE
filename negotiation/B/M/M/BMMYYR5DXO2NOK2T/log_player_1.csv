Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're guaranteed $10,000 from John, so anything above that is profit.
* **Is lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation. 

By offering $11,500, you maximize your potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
