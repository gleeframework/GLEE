"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the high price with a focus on the product's ""potential"" and ""significant returns,"" appealing to Bob's desire for a good investment.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I'm mindful that I have a guaranteed offer from John. This knowledge empowers me to walk away if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to continue the negotiation for now, as I believe Bob might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While your offer is enticing, the value of this product for someone with your business acumen is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price point accurately reflects its potential for significant returns on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I am still keeping my price well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value and potential, tailoring my language to appeal directly to Bob's business sense.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's range, I'm doing so gradually to maintain a strong negotiating position and explore the potential for a higher final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,550,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, accepting this offer represents a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me missing out on a deal entirely."
