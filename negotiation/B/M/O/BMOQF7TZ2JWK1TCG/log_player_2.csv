# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I want to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is higher than my budget of $1,200,000.
