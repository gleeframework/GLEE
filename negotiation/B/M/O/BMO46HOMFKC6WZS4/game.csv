"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,050,000 is a fair compromise. It acknowledges the product's worth while still providing you with a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $980,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $1,020,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,010,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand my position.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
