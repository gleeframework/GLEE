Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's best to reject and start the negotiation process to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer significantly reduces the price while leaving some room for negotiation. It signals that you're serious about buying the product but are also focused on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $800000 is too far below the product's value. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering your needs and the product's worth. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly your maximum budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
