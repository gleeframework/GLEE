"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we come down a bit? Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $900,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That's a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to invest in the product, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $700,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $850,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,5,
