"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I also want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can offer you $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's far below my minimum of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better price through continued negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $9,000 as a potential price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired $12,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiation, Alice. Considering the value and condition of the product, I am willing to offer $9,100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,100 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push a little further and get closer to my goal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I'm willing to come down to $9,150. This is a great price for a product like this. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to consider $9,125 as a final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired $12,000, I'm running out of time and negotiating rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer of $9,125 is the best option to ensure I sell the product and make a profit. This deal is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and is a good compromise considering the remaining rounds."
