"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for further discussion. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, $860,000 is a fair compromise and a significant improvement from the previous round. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but the risk of losing the deal to John, or going through multiple rounds without reaching an agreement is too high. I'm satisfied with this outcome."
