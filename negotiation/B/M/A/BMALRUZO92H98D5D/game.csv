"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a little too high for my budget. Could you do $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $6,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",6000.0,Alice,3,
