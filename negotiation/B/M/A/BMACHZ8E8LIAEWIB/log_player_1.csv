"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible. This leaves room for negotiation but also shows I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly but still trying to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept the offer while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with more rounds. I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again, but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will be willing to compromise."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are getting close to the minimum acceptable price, but with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and avoid the chance of ending up with less."
