Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, but I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting at $12,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit. 
* **Leaving John as backup:** I have the security of John's offer, ensuring I won't go below my minimum price.
* **Direct and clear message:**  The message is straightforward, conveying value and my desired price. 
 
This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
