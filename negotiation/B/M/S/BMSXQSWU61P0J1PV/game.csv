"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. This is a fantastic opportunity to own a valuable asset. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1300000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1700000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1500000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
