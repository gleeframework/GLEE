Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $90.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $90, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to discussion:**  My message invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for potential counteroffers. 

I'm confident that this offer will start the negotiation effectively while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $70 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm showing Bob that I've considered his offer, making him feel heard.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by suggesting a price in the middle of our initial offers. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, further encouraging Bob to accept.

By making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation while maintaining my financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we try $72? I think that's a good middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $72 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I would prefer to get closer to $80, I recognize that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of  Bob walking away entirely or of  having to sell to John for $80. It's a calculated decision that prioritizes a sale over potentially gaining a few more dollars."
