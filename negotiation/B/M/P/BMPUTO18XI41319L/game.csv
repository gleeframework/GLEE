Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $110?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That seems like a fair compromise.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $135. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
