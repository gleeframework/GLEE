Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. While $1,700,000 is a tempting offer, we are still significantly above his perceived value and have room to negotiate further.  We are aiming to close a deal somewhere between his value ($800,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000)."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're looking for while still respecting my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, and at $1,750,000, we are well above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob backing out or offering less. This offer represents a strong profit, and it's in our best interest to close the deal now."
