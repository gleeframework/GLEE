Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. By giving a specific price, you're showing you're serious about selling but also open to some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have a better option with John, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a proposal of $1,125,000 for your product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your desired price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point."
