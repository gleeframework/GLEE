Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so this price leaves me with a significant profit even if I need to lower it somewhat.  I'm confident that the product is valuable enough to justify this price, and I'm eager to see if Bob is willing to meet it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum price of $800,000, but it's still not enough to make me happy. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price. I will counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm countering with $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price given the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob sees that I'm willing to negotiate but that I'm not going to give it away."
