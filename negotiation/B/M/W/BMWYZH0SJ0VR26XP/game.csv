"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there yet.  The product's value is truly worth more than $12,000, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $13,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for some wiggle room for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the flexibility shown. However, based on my budget and the current market conditions, I am unable to agree to $13,000. Would you consider $12,500 as a fair price for the product?",12500.0,Bob,4,
