Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice has a strong fallback option. This allows her to start negotiations with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Close to John's Offer:** Offering the product for $1,450,000 is just slightly below John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and implies that Bob could be missing out on a good deal if he doesn't act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob shows interest but tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to walk away from the deal with Bob if he doesn't meet her price expectations. She has a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring she won't be forced to settle for less than her minimum acceptable price."
