"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential it holds. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
