"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential value of this product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $12,500. It's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
