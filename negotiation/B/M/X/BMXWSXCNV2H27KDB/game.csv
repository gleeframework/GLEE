"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for you to still make a substantial profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're hoping to get closer to your desired value, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  This is a significant step closer to your price, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to offer $925,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product to me while allowing you a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $925,000, Bob. However, I'm not ready to accept yet. I'm willing to make one final concession to get the deal done. I can offer the product to you for $975,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. This is my last offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
