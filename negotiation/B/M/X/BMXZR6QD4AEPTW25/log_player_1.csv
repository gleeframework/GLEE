**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking very close to his initial offer of $80. He hasn't budged significantly even with your concessions. It's unlikely he'll move much closer to your $90 bottom line. You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, which is a much better deal for you. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed profit."
