"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, reflecting your interest and my need to sell. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Bob is unwilling to pay more than his limit, and Alice has already rejected his counteroffer, it's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product at the best possible price within his budget."
