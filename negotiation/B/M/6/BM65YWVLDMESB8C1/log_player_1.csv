"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120, slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still getting a profit. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is better than selling to John, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I still have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me, and it's likely that Bob won't offer more. I've already rejected his last offer, and it's unlikely he'll offer $115 or more. It's better to accept his offer and secure a $10 profit, rather than risk a lower offer or ending up with nothing."
