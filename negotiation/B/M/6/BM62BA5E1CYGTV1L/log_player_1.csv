"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's still a good starting point.  It allows for some negotiation space, but it also reflects the fact that I value the product at no less than $10,000.  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its uniqueness, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $12000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I still believe the product is worth more.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my asking price. I'll use this opportunity to learn more about Bob's budget constraints and see if there's any wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I would prefer to get closer to $13,500, accepting this offer is still a good deal compared to selling to John for $10,000. I'm willing to take this offer and close the deal."
