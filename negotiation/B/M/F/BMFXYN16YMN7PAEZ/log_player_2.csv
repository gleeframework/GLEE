"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start the negotiation with this offer! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, it's still a significant amount. It's worth exploring if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price closer to Alice's value, showing he's serious about buying but still wants a discount. This initial counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately pushing Alice towards John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value you've expressed for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce my price to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. Bob is likely willing to pay more than $850,000 but wants to see if he can get closer to that number. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a good middle ground that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of finding a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $850,000, showing he's willing to compromise.  However, he's still significantly below Alice's offer, aiming to close the gap further.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and maintains pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. $875,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $890,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  This is a good compromise and a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and a good value, without risking further negotiation or being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
