"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value you've expressed for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce my price to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a good middle ground that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $875,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $890,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
