"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is still too high for Bob. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer. While it's tempting to buy from John at this point, Bob still has room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,030,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob might be able to secure a better price.  However, it's important to note that if Alice rejects Bob's next counteroffer, he should seriously consider buying from John as the risk of not securing the product increases with each round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to get concerned we won't be able to find common ground. While I value the product, $1,030,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, her offer is still above Bob's target price. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not securing the product is increasing. Bob has already made his final offer and is unlikely to budge further. Buying from John at this point is the most sensible decision.  It guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget, even if it means missing out on a potentially better price."
