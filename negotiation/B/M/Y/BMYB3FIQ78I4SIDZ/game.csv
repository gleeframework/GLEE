,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,030,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to get concerned we won't be able to find common ground. While I value the product, $1,030,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
