I'm starting with my maximum price because I know John will buy it for that amount. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet my price, or if he'll make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than his initial offer, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise that is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to make him agree."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it seems like he's not willing to go higher than $13,000.  I'm happy to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
