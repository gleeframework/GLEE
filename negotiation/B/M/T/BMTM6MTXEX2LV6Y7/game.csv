,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
