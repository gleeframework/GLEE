I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value.  I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, I'm confident this is the best deal I'm likely to get with him. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $1,500,000, given the risk that I might not be able to close a deal with him."
