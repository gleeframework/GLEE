Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $145. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though. How about I include a free accessory with the product if you're willing to meet me at $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to come down to a price you're willing to pay. The ""free accessory"" doesn't change the fact that you've hit a wall in negotiations. John offers a sure thing at your target price."
