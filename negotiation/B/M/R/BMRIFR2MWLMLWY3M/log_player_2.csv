"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price.  You have a solid alternative with John, so you can afford to be more assertive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still represents a good deal for her since it's above her minimum acceptable price (which is likely closer to $1,000,000). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and how far she's willing to come down.  
* **Leveraging John:** You have a solid fallback option with John, giving you the power to push harder for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your budget and is only $50,000 more than what John is offering.  It's a reasonable price, and you can likely negotiate further down in the future. However, it's not worth risking the deal with Alice for a potential $50,000 saving that might not materialize.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now rather than risk losing it entirely."
