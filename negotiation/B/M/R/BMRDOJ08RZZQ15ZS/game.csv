"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you too.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $95, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $95 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $90, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll make one more concession and offer it to you for $92. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,7,
