"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique product. However, $800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $700000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Considering the potential value of the product and my budget, I'm willing to offer $650000.  This feels like a fair price that would allow us both to reach an agreement.  What are your thoughts?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
