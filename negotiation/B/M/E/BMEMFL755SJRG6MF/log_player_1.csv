Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,400,000, which is well above Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This price allows for potential concessions if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring I get a significant profit. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I'm taking the risk of Bob rejecting this offer, but it also maximizes my potential earnings. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I will consider selling the product to John for $1,500,000 to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's room for further negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of getting closer to my desired price or even securing a higher price if Bob becomes more eager to acquire the product.

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price point. 
* I will carefully consider Bob's next move and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If the negotiations become unproductive, I will still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 represents a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my commitment to securing a good price.
* **Strategic midpoint:** This price is roughly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Setting the stage for final negotiations:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation alive and maintain the potential for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* I will closely watch Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
* If he accepts, I've achieved a satisfactory outcome.
* If he rejects, I will need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept his price. 
* I will always keep the option of selling to John in mind as a fallback."
