"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we settle at $130?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $128. It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both agree to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $128 is very close to my minimum price and a fair compromise.  I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation."
