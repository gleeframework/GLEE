Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is my best offer, so let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  There's clearly value in this product for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored to his valuation of $10,000 and seems unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000."
