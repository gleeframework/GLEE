"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this valuable product. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  I think you'll find this a very fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I can let it go for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than his desired price point of $8,000.  Bob is better off purchasing the product from John at $8,000, as that's within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
