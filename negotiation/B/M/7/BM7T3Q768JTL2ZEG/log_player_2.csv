"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this unique opportunity to you. The product I have to offer is truly exceptional and holds significant value to me. Considering its uniqueness and the effort put into it, I believe it's worth more than what others might perceive. My initial offer for the product is $15000. This price reflects not only its tangible value but also the intangible aspects such as the time, effort, and personal investment I've made into it. I understand that value can be subjective, so if $15000 is too high for you, please let me know your counteroffer, and we can discuss further.
