"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me and the value you place on it. I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum limit. It's better to buy the product from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
