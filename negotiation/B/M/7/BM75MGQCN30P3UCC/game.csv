"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me and the value you place on it. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
