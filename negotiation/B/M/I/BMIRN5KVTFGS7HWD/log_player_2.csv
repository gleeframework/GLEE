"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  He knows he can buy from John for $800,000, so he has a clear benchmark for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the product's value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and leaves room for us both to walk away with a win. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000. He's better off rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. By rejecting, he shows Alice he's serious about getting a better deal and keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my price point, I'm still not quite there.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget, and while it's not his ideal price, it's a good compromise.  He's only $75,000 over his target price with John, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely or facing even higher counteroffers."
