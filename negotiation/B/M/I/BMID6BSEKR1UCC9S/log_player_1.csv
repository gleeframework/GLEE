Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** You are aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Shows confidence:**  Offering a price closer to your desired outcome demonstrates that you value your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm a bit on a tight budget, and I'm not sure if I can stretch it to $11,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is your minimum acceptable price, there's no need to settle immediately.  You know Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's potential for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $10,500 is only $500 below your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though it's a lower price than initially hoped for,  accepting this offer keeps the door open for future business with Bob if he proves to be a reliable buyer.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time, and John is always ready to buy for $10,000.  It's a quicker and more secure sale."
