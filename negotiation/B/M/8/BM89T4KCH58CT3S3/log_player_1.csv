Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above my minimum price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I can do $135. That's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's last offer but closer to my desired price point. My message emphasizes fairness and the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $132.50? Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132.5 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and a decent profit. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, as it could lead to Bob walking away and me having to settle for John's offer of $150."
