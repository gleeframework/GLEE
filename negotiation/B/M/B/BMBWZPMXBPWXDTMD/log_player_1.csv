"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and while I appreciate your flexibility, I still believe we can find a solution within my budget. I am willing to consider $16,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $16,000 makes the most sense at this stage. It's a significant profit above Bob's perceived value and avoids the risk of him walking away and accepting my backup offer of $15,000 from John."
