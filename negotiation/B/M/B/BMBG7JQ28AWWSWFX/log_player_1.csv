"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to start with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value.  This is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential concessions if needed.  If Bob rejects, it's important to analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away.  He's essentially offering my minimum, and I believe I can get a better price. I want to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price of $13,500 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer to $13,000.  This is a compromise that shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my desired price.  It's a good compromise. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob. There's a chance I might get a slightly better price if I continue negotiating, but  I want to close the deal while I'm still in a good position."
