Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is the most strategically sound option at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,050,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. John's offer is a solid backup, but securing a deal with Bob now guarantees a profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later allows me to utilize the earnings for other opportunities."
