"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my range at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth attempting to negotiate further. You could potentially get a better deal from Alice or consider buying from John at $1,200,000."
