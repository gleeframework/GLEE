I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving a space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still remaining above Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer and still provides a good profit for me."
