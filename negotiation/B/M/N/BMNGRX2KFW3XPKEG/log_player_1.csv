Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob will bite at a higher price first, and if not, we can work our way down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that far below my minimum price of $150. I'll counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum while acknowledging Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum of $150.  I'm confident that John will pay my minimum, so it's a better choice for me to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
