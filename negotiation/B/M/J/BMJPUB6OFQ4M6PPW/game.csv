"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After re-evaluating the market value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",850000.0,Alice,3,
