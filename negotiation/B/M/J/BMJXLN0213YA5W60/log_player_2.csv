"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $120 is cheaper than buying from John at $150. 
* Although Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($80), it's still within your budget of $150 and allows you to save money."
