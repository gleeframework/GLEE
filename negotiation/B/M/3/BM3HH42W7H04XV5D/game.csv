"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, however, I find the price a little high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $725,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
