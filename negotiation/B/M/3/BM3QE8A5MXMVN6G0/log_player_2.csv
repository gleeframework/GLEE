Alice is getting closer, but I still want to try and negotiate a bit lower. $78 is still a good price for me, so I'll see if I can get her to agree to that."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and we're getting close to my target price of $78.  I'd rather not risk losing the deal by continuing to push, so I'll accept her offer of $79.5.  It's still a good deal for me, and I've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John."
