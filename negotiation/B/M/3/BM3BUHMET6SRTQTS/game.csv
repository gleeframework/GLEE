"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,250? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement, and I believe you'll find the product's value worth this price. ",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,900 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,100 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can agree on this, we both get a good deal. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,900 and $9,100, which is $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,8,
