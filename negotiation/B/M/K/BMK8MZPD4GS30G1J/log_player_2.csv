"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to tell if $600,000 is a good deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to gather more information by seeing how low Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a much lower price than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $500,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

Bob increases his counteroffer to $450,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about negotiating and willing to compromise slightly. He's aiming to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is a reasonable price compared to Bob's initial counteroffer and the price from John. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a significantly lower price than John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much better deal."
