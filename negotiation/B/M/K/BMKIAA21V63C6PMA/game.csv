"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that's fair for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value to me and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
