Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $12,000.
* **Secure a Deal:** While we have John as a backup, a bird in hand is worth two in the bush. A slightly lower price increases the chance Bob accepts immediately. 

This strategy balances risk and reward for the best possible outcome for Alice."
