"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $82.50 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's my absolute limit, but I'm really interested in the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's unique features. How about $79.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",79.5,Alice,5,
