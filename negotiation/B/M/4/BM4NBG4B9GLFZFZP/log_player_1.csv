Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation of $8,000 but leaves room for potential negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option to ensure I don't end up with less than my minimum desired price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk further negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better price.  I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial valuation. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, as I'm confident I can get my desired price from John. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and that's the best option for me at this point."
