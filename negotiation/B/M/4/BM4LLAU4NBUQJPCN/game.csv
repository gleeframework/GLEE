"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, and $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to sell for. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
