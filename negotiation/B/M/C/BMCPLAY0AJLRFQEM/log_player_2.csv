"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to achieve a significant portion of my desired value. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
Alice is starting high, leaving plenty of room for negotiation.  While $1,100,000 is within your budget, it's wise to see if you can get a better deal before settling.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This would be a significant saving for me while still allowing you to profit considerably."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to see how much she's willing to budge. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we establish a strong negotiating position and leave room for concessions later in the process.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the mutual benefits of the deal, highlighting your savings and Alice's remaining profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value you've indicated the product holds for you, while still allowing me to cover a substantial portion of my desired value. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your alternative option price. There's no longer any benefit to negotiating further, as you can't get a better deal elsewhere.  Accepting avoids the risk of Alice raising her price in future rounds."
