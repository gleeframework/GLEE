"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item is truly exceptional and offers unparalleled value, especially considering its worth to you stands at $10,000. I understand your interest and am eager to make this opportunity available to you. My proposal is to offer the product to you at a price of $9,500. This allows us both to benefit from this transaction while ensuring it remains within a fair and reasonable range. I believe this price reflects the quality and value of the product, while also providing an attractive deal for you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's price of $10,000, Bob can still do better.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a lower price from Alice or potentially find another seller."
