"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
