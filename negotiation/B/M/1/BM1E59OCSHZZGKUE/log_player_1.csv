Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that you are willing to compromise, which can be helpful in securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 110}
