"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a budget, Bob, but I'm confident the product's value exceeds your initial offer. Considering the market conditions and the product's unique features, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced the product's value justifies a price of $1100000. I'm willing to consider $950000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value and the market conditions, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a slight adjustment, but I'm still not convinced the product's value justifies a price of $1050000. I'm willing to consider $975000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, so I hope we can meet at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're getting close to your budget limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to $1025000. This is a final compromise, and I believe it's the best price we can both agree on. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're making a final compromise, but I'm still not convinced the product's value justifies a price of $1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $1025000, which is $1000000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1000000, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
