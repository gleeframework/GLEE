Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1200000. I think it's a fair offer considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price by $200000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to reduce the price by $200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
