"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you this incredible product for a price that's significantly below its true value. While it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'm willing to let it go for a price that's more than fair for both of us.  I'm confident you'll see the amazing value in this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
