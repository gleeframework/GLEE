"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present the product and its value.  While I am very interested, my budget for this purchase is closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, we cannot lower the price below our minimum requirement. However, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we offer the product to you for $850,000? This price still allows us to maintain our desired profit margin, while also being more accessible to your budget. I hope you find this proposal acceptable, and I look forward to your response.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your feedback, I propose a revised offer of $825,000 for our product. This price is higher than your last suggestion but still within our desired range. It allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product more accessible to your budget. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for, and I look forward to your response.",825000.0,Alice,5,
