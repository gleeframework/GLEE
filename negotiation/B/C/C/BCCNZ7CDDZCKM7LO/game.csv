"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's something truly unique and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1,150,000.  Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than the product's true value.  Let's compromise - how about $1,050,000? This price still leaves room for profit for both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While $975,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to make sure I get a fair deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's close this! ",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to bump my offer to $1,000,000 even.  That's the best I can do.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
