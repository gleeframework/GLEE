"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $15,500 is still a little more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
