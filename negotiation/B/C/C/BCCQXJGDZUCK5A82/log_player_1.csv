Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics of the situation:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I want to ensure a smooth transaction.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly lower than his valuation leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer and still land within a price range that's highly profitable for you.
* **John as a Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, so you have a strong fallback position. This allows you to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower offer might be more appealing."
