You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  A counteroffer of $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving Bob room for negotiation while still potentially being within a reasonable range for Alice to consider. This aggressive counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. There's room for further negotiation, especially since Alice rejected Bob's counteroffer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's raised his offer from $600,000, showing a willingness to compromise, but he's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while potentially finding a price both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has already negotiated the price down significantly.  Alice's current offer of $725,000 is a reasonable compromise, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price while avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether."
