"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $850,000?  That's still a great deal for you and closer to my target price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is still a great deal for you and reflects the value of this exceptional product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
