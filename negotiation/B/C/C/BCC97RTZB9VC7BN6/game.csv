Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Would you consider lowering the price to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
