Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without being too aggressive. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer lets you see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can adjust accordingly knowing you have John as a backup."
