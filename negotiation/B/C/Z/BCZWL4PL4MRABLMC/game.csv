"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This offer represents a significant discount and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise given the value we both see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. Let's split the difference - $1,125,000 and we have a deal. I need to know your final answer soon as I have another interested buyer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
