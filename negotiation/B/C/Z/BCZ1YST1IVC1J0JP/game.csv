,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your perspective, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for such a great product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I'm willing to pay that price",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $127.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet at $129.  It's a small compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it's still a great deal for the product.",129.0,Alice,5,
