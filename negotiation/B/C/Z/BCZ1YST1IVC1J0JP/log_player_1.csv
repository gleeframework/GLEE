{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below what I need to earn, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your perspective, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for such a great product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I'm willing to pay that price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell it for that low.  I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $127.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet at $129.  It's a small compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it's still a great deal for the product."", ""product_price"": 129}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $129. I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, it's very close, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. I'll accept his offer, as the chance of a better offer from Bob is unlikely, and I still have a better offer from John if this negotiation fails."
