"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price. How about we start around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher price. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me.  I'm serious about buying, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your willingness to engage in this negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both want to find a solution here. Your willingness to meet in the middle is good, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I'm confident this product is worth it at that price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget considerations.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,7,
