Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John as Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). This maximizes your potential profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob."
