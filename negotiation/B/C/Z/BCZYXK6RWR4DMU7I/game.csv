Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
