Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob, if he tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and other potential buyers, creating a sense of scarcity and desirability. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You could test different pricing strategies to see what yields the best outcome."
