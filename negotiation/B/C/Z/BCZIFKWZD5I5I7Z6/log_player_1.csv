Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It also allows you to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer, while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still lower than the initial offer you made.  There's potential to get closer to your ideal price.  By rejecting, you can make a counter-offer that might be more appealing to Bob while still earning more than you would selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer meets Bob halfway, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It's still above your minimum acceptable price, and potentially close enough to Bob's desired price that he may be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer is the closest to my target price and still significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting ensures a sale and a good profit."
