"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little, but $125 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would still give you a great value for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $135 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $130. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
