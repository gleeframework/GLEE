"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me and allows us to reach an agreement.  ",900000.0,Bob,4,
