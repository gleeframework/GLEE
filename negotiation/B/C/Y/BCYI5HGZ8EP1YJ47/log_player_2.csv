Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $780,000, which would be $815,000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my own interests.
