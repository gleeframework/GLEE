"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $12,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $9,750 just isn't quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $10,125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very fair, and I respect that.  Let's settle this right now. How about $9,900?  That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9900.0,Bob,6,
