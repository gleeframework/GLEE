"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  Let me know if that's a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the Price:**  Bob is starting his counteroffer at a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within his maximum budget. 
* **Setting the Stage:**  This counteroffer signals Bob's serious interest in the product, but also establishes his negotiating position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not a ""take it or leave it"" proposition, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to go down to $12500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for Further Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  While buying from John is an option, it's better to see if a better deal can be struck with Alice.  There's a chance she might come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $12,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is now offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and meet halfway.
* **Fair Price:**  Bob believes this price is fair, as it's still within his budget and also a reasonable compromise for Alice.
* **Closing the Deal:** This offer highlights Bob's intention to close the deal, emphasizing the win-win nature of the proposed price."
