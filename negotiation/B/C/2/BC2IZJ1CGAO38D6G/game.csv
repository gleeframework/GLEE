"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $950,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I'm hopeful we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a significant investment, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still slightly beyond my budget. I'm confident this product will be valuable, and I'd be happy to pay $800,000 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this investment.",800000.0,Bob,4,
