"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still higher than the product's value to you ($800,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's better to see if you can get closer to your ideal price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This is a fair price that still allows you to benefit from the product while also reflecting its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what the product is worth to me ($800,000). I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a better deal closer to my target price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  $900,000 feels more reasonable given the product's value to you.  This price allows you to still make a profit while offering me a significant savings.  Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer shows that you're actively participating in the negotiation and not settling for the first price that's even slightly better than John's offer.
* **Compromise:**  The offer of $900,000 is a compromise, showing a willingness to move closer to Alice's position, but still aiming for a price closer to your target.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $925000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $915000. This is a compromise that balances our interests and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $915,000 is still above my ideal range. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target price of $900,000, especially since Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. I'll counter with a price closer to my goal, but if she rejects it, I'll be prepared to buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $915000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $912500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only willing to go down to $912,500, which is still higher than my target of $900,000. However, I'm running out of rounds, and John's offer is $1,000,000. Accepting this offer is still a significant savings compared to buying from John. 

It's a calculated risk, but considering the time pressure and the possibility of not getting a better deal, it's the most sensible choice at this point."
