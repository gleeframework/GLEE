"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
