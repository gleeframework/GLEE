"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial returns.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000? This reflects the product's true worth while recognizing your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,600,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
