"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My new offer is $1,300,000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,275,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,280,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. My final offer is $1,280,000. If you're still not comfortable, I'll have to consider other options.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
