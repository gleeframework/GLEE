Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,280,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. My final offer is $1,280,000. If you're still not comfortable, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to get the lowest price possible. While Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer, it's still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, and with only a few rounds left, the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is too high."
