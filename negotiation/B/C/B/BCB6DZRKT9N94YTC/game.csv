"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could be flexible, but not to that extent. Would you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, my budget is pushing me closer to John's offer. Could you meet me at $1,200,000? It's a strong offer, and I'd be ready to close the deal immediately at that price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
