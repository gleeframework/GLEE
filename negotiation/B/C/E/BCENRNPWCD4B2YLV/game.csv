"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $10,250? That's the best I can do.",10250.0,Bob,4,
