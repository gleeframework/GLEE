"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe is worth at least $1000000 to you, and it's something I know you've been looking for.  I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its value, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm proposing a price of $1050000.  This allows for a significant return on your investment and also ensures I receive fair compensation for the product. Let me know your thoughts. ",1050000.0,Alice,1,
