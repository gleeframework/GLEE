"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could meet you halfway between our offers. Would you consider $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still within Bob's budget.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. It's a good deal for Bob, and there's no guarantee that more negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome."
