"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to me. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
