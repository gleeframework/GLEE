"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's settle on that and finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
