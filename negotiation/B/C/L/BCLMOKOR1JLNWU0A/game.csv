"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Can we discuss further?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so how about $800,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
