"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to say that $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $16000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. What do you say?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I can offer it to you for $17500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17500 is still a bit much for me.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $16500. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $16500 is a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is a compromise, but I'm willing to consider it. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $16750, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",16750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $16750. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm going to meet you at $16750. However, I need you to agree to a few additional terms that will make this deal more favorable for me. I'm thinking of adding a 5% commission on the sale price. Would you be willing to consider this?",16750.0,Alice,9,
