Round 5

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $16750. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm going to meet you at $16750. However, I need you to agree to a few additional terms that will make this deal more favorable for me. I'm thinking of adding a 5% commission on the sale price. Would you be willing to consider this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,750 is close to your ideal price, the additional 5% commission makes it an unfavorable deal.  You're on your last round with Alice, and you have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $15,000.  Since this is a more secure and cost-effective option, it's best to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiations."
