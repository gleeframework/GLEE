,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13500? Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  Let's close this deal. It's a great product and you won't regret it!",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12200. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",12200.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $12000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,8,
