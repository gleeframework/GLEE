"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that $2,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the returns you stand to gain.  To move us closer, I'm proposing $2,000,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while acknowledging the product's inherent value.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about my budget. My counteroffer is $1,500,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
