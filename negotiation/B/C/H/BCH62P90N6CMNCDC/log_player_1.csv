Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a very reasonable price of $120. I think it would be perfect for you!"", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have John waiting with a guaranteed $100 offer. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have some leverage because you know John will buy it for $100. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Bob up a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That's a very fair price for this quality of product."", ""product_price"": 105}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** Showing a willingness to compromise can keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Above Minimum:** This price is still above your minimum acceptable amount ($100) and leaves a little room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's quality, you reinforce the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $92? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Limit:** Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $92. You've tried to meet in the middle, but the difference between his offer and your minimum is significant enough.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has uncertain outcomes and delays closing a deal. Taking John's offer ensures a sale at a price you find acceptable without further hassle."
