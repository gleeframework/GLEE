"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,250,000 is a bold move, but it's still within the realm of possibility for Alice. This price is significantly lower than Alice's value, and Bob is hoping to capitalize on her desire to sell. It also leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,380,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. There's a chance Alice might lower the price further if she wants to close the deal. Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate again, possibly securing an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is closer to his maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. Offering $1,300,000 is a compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation if Alice is still willing to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While there's a chance Alice might lower the price further, the negotiation process is becoming lengthy. Bob has already made two counteroffers, and there's no guarantee that Alice will eventually meet his price.

It's more efficient for Bob to purchase the product from John at $1,200,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
