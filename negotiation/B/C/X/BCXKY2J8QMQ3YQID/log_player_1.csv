"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high with an offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of how much he's willing to pay.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Unknown Value to Bob:** The key is to start high and see how Bob reacts. 
* **10 Rounds:** I need to be strategic and avoid getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have the option of going with John's guaranteed $1,500,000 at any point, which provides a safety net and a benchmark for my negotiations with Bob."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to accept just yet. I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I have 8 rounds left. 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Potential:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While $1,800,000 is a good amount, the potential to earn more outweighs the risk of losing the deal to Bob. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for some profit. 

**Explanation:**

* **Mid-Point Compromise:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By making incremental counteroffers, I'm showing flexibility and creating a path towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of further negotiation is high. 

**Explanation:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in Round 4, and I have limited time to reach an agreement.
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  I can't be sure Bob will be willing to negotiate further, and his offers might keep decreasing.
* **John's Offer:**  While $1,750,000 isn't ideal, it is significantly higher than John's guaranteed $1,500,000. 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential for a lower price in future rounds."
