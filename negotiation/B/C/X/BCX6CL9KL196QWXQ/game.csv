I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product for a limited time. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the value of the product and understand its significance to me. However, based on my budget and financial situation, I am unable to agree to the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but after careful consideration, I am still unable to agree to $1050000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1020000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
Thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered your proposal and would like to make a counteroffer of $1010000. This is the highest amount I can comfortably pay while still being within my budget.,1010000.0,Bob,6,
