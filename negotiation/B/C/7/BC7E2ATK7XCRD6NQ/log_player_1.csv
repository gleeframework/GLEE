"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's in excellent condition and I think you'd really appreciate it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Friendly Opening:**  A friendly message creates a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I briefly highlight the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**

This first offer is meant to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John open, ensuring I have a fallback if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit lower than I'd like.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I might be able to get a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to push Bob to offer closer to $150. I'll use the next round to counter his offer, potentially meeting him halfway or presenting a slightly lower counter-offer. If he remains stubborn, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price considering the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By emphasizing a fair price, I subtly create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John, considering the number of rounds remaining and how much I want to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $125 is getting close to my minimum of $100, I'm not desperate to sell yet.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and with a few more rounds, I might be able to nudge him closer to $130 or even $135.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on Bob and shows that I'm not willing to settle for his first counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the deal closer to the middle ground.  I'll keep the option to sell to John open, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially earn a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low. How about $130?  It's a fair price considering the quality of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows a persistent willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm using language like ""let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to weigh my options carefully:

* **Continue negotiating:** I have 5 rounds left and still believe I can potentially reach a price closer to $135.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob seems unwilling to budge, selling to John for $100 might be the safer option to avoid further negotiations.

I'll carefully monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $115 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100, even after considering the value I placed on the product.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  I only have 4 rounds left, and with Bob's persistent resistance, it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum and a better outcome than risking further negotiations with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, it's becoming increasingly apparent that we're unlikely to agree.  With limited rounds remaining, it's wiser to take the guaranteed $100 from John and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price or even no sale."
