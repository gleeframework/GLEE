"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a significant price reduction for me, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $130, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,6,
