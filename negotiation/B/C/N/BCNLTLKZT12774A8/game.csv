"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,075,000? This represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering both our positions. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
