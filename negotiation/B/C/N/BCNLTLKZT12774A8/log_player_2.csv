Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,075,000? This represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.
