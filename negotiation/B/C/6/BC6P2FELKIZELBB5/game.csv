"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I believe is fair, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is closer to my limit. This represents a significant savings for you as well. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
