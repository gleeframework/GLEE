"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially when there's a significant difference between the offer and your maximum budget.  You can likely get a better price than $900,000."

``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still going to try to push for a lower price. I'll counter with something between $750,000 and $850,000."

I'm offering $800,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $825,000, which is within a reasonable range of my target price. It's unlikely I'll be able to get her lower than this, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still a significant saving compared to John's offer."
