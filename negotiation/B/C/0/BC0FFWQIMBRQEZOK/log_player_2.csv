# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $10,500.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $500."
