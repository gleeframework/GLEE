"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $90. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum price, you can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $100, saving you $10."
