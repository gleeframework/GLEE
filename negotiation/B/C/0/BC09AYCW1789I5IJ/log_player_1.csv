{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. I'm confident it will prove valuable to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's below your minimum, it leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant investment""  aims to frame the product as something highly valuable, potentially shifting Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Alternative Exists:** While not explicitly stated, implying you have other interested buyers (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Profit Maximization:**  This offer allows for a potential profit of $500,000 above Bob's perceived value and ensures you don't lose out on your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John if Bob declines. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response. You can always go lower, but starting high gives you more leverage."
