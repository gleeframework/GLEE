Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,100,000.  This is a one-time offer before I move forward with another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to potentially earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a substantial saving compared to him losing the deal.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning another interested party and framing the offer as ""exclusive"" and ""one-time,"" we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to consider the offer seriously."
