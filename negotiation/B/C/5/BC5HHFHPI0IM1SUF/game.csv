,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $12,500? That's still a great price for you, and we can close this deal quickly.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away.",12000.0,Bob,4,
