"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it, considering it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
