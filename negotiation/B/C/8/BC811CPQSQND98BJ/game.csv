"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000. Let me know if you're interested!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $900000. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to have to be a bit firmer on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm offering the product to you for $1400000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $1100000. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to offer the product to you for $1300000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $1300000. I'll meet you at $1150000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1150000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already made a significant concession, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it will be my last. I'm offering the product to you for $1250000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1250000 is still too high. I'll make one last offer: $1100000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1100000, which would be $1175000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,9,
