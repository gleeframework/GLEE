``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows that I'm willing to compromise. I've chosen to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm willing to accept a lower price to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I think I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $10,000."
