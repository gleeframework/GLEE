"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
