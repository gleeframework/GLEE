You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $10,250.  At this point, accepting her offer would only save $250 compared to John's guaranteed price of $10,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
