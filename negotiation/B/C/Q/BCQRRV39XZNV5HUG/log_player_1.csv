"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Aiming close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) increases the chances of him accepting quickly, but leaves some space for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind that you have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John gives you a strong fallback position. You don't want to settle for less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both your initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you're aiming for a higher price and are willing to negotiate further.  You have room to come down before reaching John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a price exactly halfway between your last offer and Bob's counteroffer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's unique value reinforces why you're seeking a higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and leaves room for further adjustments in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,325,000, which would be $1,287,500. Can we consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating incrementally, but we're still significantly above John's offer. While accepting now would close the deal, there's a reasonable chance to push for a better price in the remaining rounds. We'll continue to counteroffer strategically, inching closer to his offers but not conceding too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Considering the long-term value this product offers, I'd be willing to agree to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but slowly:** We're coming down in smaller increments now, signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line. 
* **Highlighting long-term value:**  This subtly reminds Bob of the product's benefits, potentially justifying the higher price.
* **Projecting fairness:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" might make Bob more receptive. 
* **Strategic positioning:** We're still a comfortable distance from John's offer, allowing room for further negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** We've reached a point where further haggling might only yield small increments. Bob is clearly trying to stay below $1,300,000, and we risk him becoming frustrated or walking away.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,275,000 is still a significant profit, exceeding John's offer by $275,000.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures the sale."
