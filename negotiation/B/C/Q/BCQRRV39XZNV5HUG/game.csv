,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,325,000, which would be $1,287,500. Can we consider that?",1287500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Considering the long-term value this product offers, I'd be willing to agree to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. Can we meet at this price?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
