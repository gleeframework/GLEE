Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This price is fair and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still a bit too high at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price and ensures a substantial profit.  Accepting this offer is the best decision to maximize my earnings while also ensuring a successful deal."
