"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price range. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This price is fair and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not within my ideal range. I'm still aiming to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible.  By rejecting, I can continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still a bit too high at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
