"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This price is fair and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still a bit too high at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
