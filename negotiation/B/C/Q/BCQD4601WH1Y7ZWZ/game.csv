"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, but I'm thinking it's a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you meet me in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  How about $12,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
