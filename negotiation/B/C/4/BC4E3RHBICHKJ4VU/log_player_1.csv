Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $100, which is the price I was originally considering from John. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll go above $100. John offers a guaranteed $120, which is a better outcome for me.  It's time to move on to a sale I know I can make."
