"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider this compromise?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is the bare minimum I can accept.  Let's close the deal!",15000.0,Alice,5,
