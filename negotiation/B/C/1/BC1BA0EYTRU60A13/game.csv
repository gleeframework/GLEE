"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which reflects its quality and potential. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs while still allowing me to achieve a good outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me and the value you've placed on it.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a middle ground here.  Your offer of $875,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's close this deal and get you the product you need.",890000.0,Alice,5,
