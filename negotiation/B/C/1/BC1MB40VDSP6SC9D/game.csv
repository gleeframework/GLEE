"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe still benefits both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $725,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $675,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product will bring to my business. Can you consider this offer?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $675,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $712,500. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",712500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $712,500 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $675,000 and $725,000, which would be $700,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product will bring to my business. Can you consider this offer?",700000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going back to $700,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $715,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to pay from John, and I'm not sure I want to go any higher. I'm willing to make a final offer of $695,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",695000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $695,000.

"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm going to have to pass on your offer. I'll be buying the product from John for $800,000 instead.",800000.0,Bob,10,
