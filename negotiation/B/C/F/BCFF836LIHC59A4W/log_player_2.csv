{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's unlikely to go lower than $920,000. With only one round left, I have to decide whether to take this offer or go with John.  $920,000 is still significantly higher than my desired price and I'm not confident I can get her lower in the last round.  Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees I get the product at a price within my budget and saves me valuable time."
