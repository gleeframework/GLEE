,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe this product would be valuable to me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be open to $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the potential value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm impressed by your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll consider a price of $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $975,000.  This is a very strong offer on my part, as I'm pushing my financial limits. ",975000.0,Bob,8,
