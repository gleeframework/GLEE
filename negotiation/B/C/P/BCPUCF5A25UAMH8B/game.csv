"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's try $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the conversation. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I can do $1,025,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe this represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $975,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, and I'll meet you at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $985,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",985000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $985,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one final compromise, and I can offer you the product for $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in round 3. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
