"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you and is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle on $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm still very interested. How about we split the difference again and land at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
