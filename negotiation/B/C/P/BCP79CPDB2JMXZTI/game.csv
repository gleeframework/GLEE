"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value we both place on the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $11,000. This would be a good midpoint for us both, allowing you a decent profit and still leaving me room for a reasonable purchase. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go down to $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
