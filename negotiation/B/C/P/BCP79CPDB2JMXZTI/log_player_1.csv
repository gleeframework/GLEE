# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.
