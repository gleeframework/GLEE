"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value we both place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above his ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $11,000. This would be a good midpoint for us both, allowing you a decent profit and still leaving me room for a reasonable purchase. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go down to $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. At this point, Alice is offering $11,500, which is still $3,500 over Bob's maximum budget. Since he can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's a much better deal to go with John.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get Bob to his desired price point."
