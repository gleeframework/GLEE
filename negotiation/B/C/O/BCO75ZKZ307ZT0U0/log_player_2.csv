Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $3,000 reduction is significant but not unreasonable.  This shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.

* **Open to discussion:**  ""Let me know what you think"" invites further dialogue."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $13,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:** $14,000 is only $1,000 more than your target of $13,000.
* **Alice is firm:**  Alice has shown she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Limited time:** You're halfway through the rounds and don't want to risk losing the product to John.
* **Good value:** While not your ideal price, it's a reasonable deal considering the product's value and the potential for getting a lower price from John. 

**It's a risk/reward calculation:**  Accepting now secures the product at a price that's still within your budget. Trying to negotiate further might result in a lower price but also risks losing the product entirely."
