"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $18,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $17,500?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $17,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I can do $19,000, and that's my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $19,000 is still a bit too rich for me. How about we try $16,500?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I need to stay above $18,000.  How about we split the difference and call it $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $18,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $16,000?",16000.0,Bob,8,
