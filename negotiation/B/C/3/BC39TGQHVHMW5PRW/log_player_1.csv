{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $100 was reasonable given my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more time to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I really want to work with you on this, but $105 is still just a bit too low.  Let's meet at $110. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll need to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 110}
