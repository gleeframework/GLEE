,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $100 was reasonable given my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I really want to work with you on this, but $105 is still just a bit too low.  Let's meet at $110. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll need to move on to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,5,
