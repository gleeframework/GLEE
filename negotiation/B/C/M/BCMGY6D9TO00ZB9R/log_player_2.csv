"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something really special, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $100. 
* Since John is also offering the product for $100, rejecting Alice's offer gives you the same product for the same price.
* The goal is to save money, and rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate with Alice or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
