Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I need to get at least $800,000 to make it worthwhile.
* **Bob's maximum value:** He values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation space:**  There's a $200,000 gap between our values.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Offering $950,000 gives me a good chance of getting a higher price than John's offer, but it's not so high that Bob is likely to walk away.

By offering $950,000, I'm aiming for a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a successful sale."
