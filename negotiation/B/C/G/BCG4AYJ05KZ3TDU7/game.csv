"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a little too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to do $100?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
