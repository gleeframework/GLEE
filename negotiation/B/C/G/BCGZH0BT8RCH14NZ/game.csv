"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
