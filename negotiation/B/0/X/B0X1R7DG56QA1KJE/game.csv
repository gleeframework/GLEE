"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11000. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
