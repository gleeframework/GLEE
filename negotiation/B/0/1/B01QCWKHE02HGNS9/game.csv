"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to gain something from this transaction. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not satisfied with the price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
