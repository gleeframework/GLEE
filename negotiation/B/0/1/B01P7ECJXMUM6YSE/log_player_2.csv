"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for $120 or less. Alice's offer of $180 is far above Bob's maximum price. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than his maximum price. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if they can reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is still within his budget and hopefully signals to Alice that a deal can be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for his desired price. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee and it risks losing the opportunity to purchase from John."
