Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still well above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **It's a clear offer:** The message is friendly but also conveys the value of the product and establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price. I will counter-offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $11,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it will be well worth your investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. While it's below my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $15,000. I'm confident that I can make a profit at this price, and it's better than risking further negotiation or selling to John at $15,000. I'll accept the offer and move forward with the sale."
