"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $150.  What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $150 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $165?  That's still a good deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $160 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $162.  This is my final offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price.",162.0,Alice,5,
