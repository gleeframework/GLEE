Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price for a product worth over $1,500,000 to me.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $1,600,000?  This price is still within your budget and closer to my desired value.  Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show my commitment to the deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I am willing to risk continuing to negotiate with Bob, hoping to push the price up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1,450,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's settle on $1,550,000. This price represents a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,475,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering $1,475,000, which is getting close to my minimum threshold, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  With John already offering $1,500,000, it's a safer choice to close the deal with John and secure that price.  I'm not willing to risk a potential breakdown in negotiations with Bob, especially with only a few rounds left."
