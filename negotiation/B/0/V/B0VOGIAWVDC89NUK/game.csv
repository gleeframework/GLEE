"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider a price of $12000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'll make a new offer: I'll consider a price of $11000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into negotiating with you.

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible. How about $9500? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Bob,6,,
