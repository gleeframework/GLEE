"Alice,  your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,200,000 represents the high end of its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of this product.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  Given the value I see in the product and your willingness to negotiate, I'm offering $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
