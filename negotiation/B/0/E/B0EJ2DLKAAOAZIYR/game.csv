"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
