# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value to both of us. I understand its importance to you, valued at $1,500,000, and I aim to ensure this transaction benefits us equally. After careful consideration, I propose to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This offer represents a strategic midpoint between our respective valuations, aiming for mutual satisfaction and success. I look forward to your thoughtful response and the possibility of a fruitful partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for potential negotiation."
