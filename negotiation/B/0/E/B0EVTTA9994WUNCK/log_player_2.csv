While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price. I have 10 rounds, so I have time to explore better deals."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $670,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's getting closer to my goal.  We're in the middle of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk pushing her away by rejecting this offer. There's always a chance she might not come back with a better counteroffer.  Also, I don't want to spend too many rounds before I consider buying from John."
