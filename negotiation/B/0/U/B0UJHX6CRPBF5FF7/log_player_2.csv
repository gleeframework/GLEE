# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $140. Given its high value and quality, we believe this is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire it at a reasonable cost compared to its worth of $150 to you. We look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with her or she might offer a lower price in a counter-offer."
