"Bob, I understand you're on a budget. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a decent profit.",132.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $127.50? This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",127.5,Bob,4,
