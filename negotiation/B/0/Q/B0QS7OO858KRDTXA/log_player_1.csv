Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $145 is close to Bob's perceived value of $120. While it's above, it might be tempting enough for him to consider, especially if the product truly interests him.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  This price ensures you still make a profit if Bob accepts, and it's comfortably above your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, or he might outright reject it. Your strategy should also consider how you'll respond in those scenarios."
