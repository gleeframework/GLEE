"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without explicitly revealing my minimum. 

I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate.  I have 8 rounds remaining to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe I can potentially get a better offer from Bob, even if it takes several rounds.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore if a mutually beneficial deal is possible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again subtly emphasizing the value of the product without revealing my exact minimum.  This helps keep the negotiation focused on the product's worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, fostering a collaborative approach. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can move closer to a deal in the next few rounds.  If he rejects it again, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and significantly lower than my value for the product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offers are moving closer, he's still not willing to meet my minimum.  I have six rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Staying firm:**  I need to maintain my position and be firm on my minimum acceptable price. If I accept his offer, I would be losing a significant amount of money.

I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground that still brings me closer to my desired price. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore if a mutually beneficial deal is possible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I can accept for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering, and it gives us both a chance to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Again):**  I'm proposing a middle ground between Bob's offer of $7,000 and my previous offer of $9,000. This shows continued flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to go too much lower.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate that $8,000 is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. This keeps the focus on the product's worth and not just on the price tag.
* **Positive & Collaborative Tone:** I maintain a friendly and collaborative tone, making it clear that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to carefully consider my options, weighing the possibility of selling to John against my desire to reach a deal with Bob.  I still have five rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."
