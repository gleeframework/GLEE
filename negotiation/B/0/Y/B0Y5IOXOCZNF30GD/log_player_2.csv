Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we're both at our limits. I'm willing to meet you at $145. This is a good price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  I don't want to go back and forth any longer. Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge below $145. Since you have the option to buy from John for $150, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
