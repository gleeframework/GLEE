"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $110 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $160.  This is still a good price for a product worth $150 to you, and it allows me to get a fair return. Let's try to make this work.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a win-win for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $145, which is a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this now.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $140 to close the deal. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close, but we're both at our limits. I'm willing to meet you at $145. This is a good price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  I don't want to go back and forth any longer. Let's finalize this now.",145.0,Alice,7,
