Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal for Bob.  While I'm not going to give away the product for cheap, I'm also not trying to squeeze every last dollar out of him. This approach may make him more likely to accept.

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy is designed to maximize my profit while also considering the potential for a deal with Bob. Here's the reasoning:

* **Maximizing Profit:** $1,100,000 is a good price for me, as it's still significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Offering a lower price increases the chance of Bob accepting the deal. If he rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. The optimal strategy will depend on factors like how eager I am to sell quickly and how much bargaining power I believe I have."
