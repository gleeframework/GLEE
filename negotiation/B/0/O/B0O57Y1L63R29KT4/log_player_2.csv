"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000, a significant discount from its true value. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
