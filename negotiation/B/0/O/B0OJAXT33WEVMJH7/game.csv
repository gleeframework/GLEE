"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $880000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $915000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1000000, and I think that's a fair price considering its value and rarity. I'm not willing to compromise further.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
