Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's not too low:**  $9,500 is still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him some room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's not too high:** $9,500 is close to my minimum value of $10,000, so it's a good starting point without risking a quick rejection.
* **It's friendly:**  Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport and potentially makes Bob more open to negotiating.

I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I also have a backup buyer in John, so I don't need to accept a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am currently working with a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Bob's offer:

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
