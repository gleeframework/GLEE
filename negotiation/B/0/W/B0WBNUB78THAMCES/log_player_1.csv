Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup offer."
