{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a truly unique and valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's unique qualities and value to make it more attractive to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm using language that indicates I'm willing to negotiate. This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the unfolding negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Gain leverage:**  Show that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore higher offers:**  See if I can get closer to my initial asking price in subsequent rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is still higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? This would allow both of us to achieve a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's a significant compromise from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing fairness to create a sense of cooperation and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation in case Bob wants to counteroffer again.

**Strategy:**

By proposing a counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm confident that I can achieve a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1350000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1275000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility that Bob might walk away. 

Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Small difference:** The difference between Bob's offer and my minimum is only $75,000, which is a small percentage of the overall price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Further negotiation might result in Bob backing out, leaving me with the lower price from John.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, which could be better spent elsewhere. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point. It allows me to secure a good price quickly and avoid the risks of further negotiation."
