Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than John's offer, giving Bob a potential incentive to buy. However, it's not so high that it becomes unreasonable and likely to be rejected outright. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By offering $9,000, you are balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and you having to settle for John's $8,000) with the potential reward of earning $1,000 more.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects it, you can adjust your offer accordingly. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's reaction:** Pay close attention to Bob's response and any feedback he provides. 
* **Prepare for Negotiation:** Be ready to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Consider lowering the price:** If Bob seems hesitant, you might consider lowering your price slightly to make the deal more attractive."
