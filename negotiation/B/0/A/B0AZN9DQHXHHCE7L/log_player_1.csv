Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value to me and what you need to get for it. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a little more.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, and we could finally close this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $8,800. This is a fair offer, and it will let us both get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price of $9,000, I've already spent several rounds trying to get there and I'm running out of time.  $8,800 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
