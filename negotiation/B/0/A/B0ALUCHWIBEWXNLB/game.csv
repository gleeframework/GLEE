"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still allows me to get a fair price for the product, while hopefully being a price you can work with. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer to my asking price, I still need to ensure I get a fair deal.  How about $1,225,000? This is a reasonable compromise that hopefully addresses both our needs.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I'm willing to come up a bit to $1,190,000. I need to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair offer. What do you say?",1190000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations. While $1,190,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. To finalize this deal, I need to be at $1,210,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my expenses.  Let's make this deal happen.",1210000.0,Alice,7,
