Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,000 is my absolute limit for this product. Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price, otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I've increased my offer to $10,000, which is still a good deal for me, but I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer. 
* **Time pressure:** I'm subtly adding a little pressure by mentioning ""other options,"" implying I'm close to making a decision.
* **Focus on the value:** I'm not just stating a price, but reminding Alice that $10,000 is still a fair price for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget, but it's closer than her previous offers.  There's still room for a compromise, and I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. I'm also considering the value of the product and the possibility of a lower price from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again. I'm still firm on my offer of $10,000. This product is worth it to me at that price, but unfortunately, I can't go any higher.  Let me know if you're ready to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```
