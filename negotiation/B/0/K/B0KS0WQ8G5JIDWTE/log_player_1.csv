Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts. 

Here's why:

* **For me:**  It's significantly more than what I would get from John.
* **For Bob:** It's a good deal, allowing him to purchase the product for less than its worth to him.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, I increase the chances of him accepting, while still securing a substantial profit."
