"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That way we both get a fair deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
