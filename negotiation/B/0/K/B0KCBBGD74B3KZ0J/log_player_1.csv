I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
