{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and also signals that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really like the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to take $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 115}
