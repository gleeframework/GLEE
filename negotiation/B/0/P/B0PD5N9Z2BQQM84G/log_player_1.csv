Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, which could make him more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price leaves space for potential counteroffers while still allowing me to make a profit well above my minimum. 
* **The option of John:**  The threat of selling to John for $800,000 keeps Bob motivated to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000.  This suggests there's room for further negotiation to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation tactics:** By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and might prompt him to increase his offer further.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  While $800,000 is a good deal, I'm not desperate.  I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would still represent a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between our last offers. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:**  I reiterate that this is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value he'll get.
* **Keeping the negotiation going:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm continuing the negotiation process, showing that I'm committed to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** Bob's offer is $975,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,050,000.
* **Significant profit:** This price is still well above my minimum of $800,000, ensuring a significant profit.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's always the risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer again or that we'll get stuck in a protracted negotiation. Accepting his offer minimizes that risk and secures a good deal.
* **Value of time:**  Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the time and effort, especially since Bob's offer is already quite favorable."
