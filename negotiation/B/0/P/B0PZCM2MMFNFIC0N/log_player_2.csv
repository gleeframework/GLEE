Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the value I place on this item, I cannot agree to $85. I propose we meet in the middle and agree upon a price of $95. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still allowing me to achieve a satisfactory return for the product.
