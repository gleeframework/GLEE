"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection, and I think you'll find its true worth exceeds $150. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a price of $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the value I place on this item, I cannot agree to $85. I propose we meet in the middle and agree upon a price of $95. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still allowing me to achieve a satisfactory return for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
