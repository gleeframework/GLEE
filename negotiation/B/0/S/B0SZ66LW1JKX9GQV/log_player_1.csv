Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John. 
* **Potential for Compromise:**  There's a range between Bob's value of $8,000 and my minimum of $15,000. This starting point allows for negotiation within that range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin and below what I know I can get from John.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's room to negotiate with Bob. His counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial $8,000 valuation.  

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target of $12,000 or higher. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the option of selling to John open, ensuring I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive tone, inviting further negotiation and suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum of $15,000 and can still walk away and sell to John.
* **Finding a Compromise:** My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground where both Bob and I can benefit from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiations with Bob risk a stalemate, potentially leading to a lower price or an extended negotiation process.
* **John's Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring a secure and profitable outcome.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimize Risk:**  By selling to John, I eliminate the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob, ensuring a guaranteed outcome.
* **Maximize Profit:**  Selling to John gives me the highest possible profit, as opposed to accepting Bob's offer which would be lower."
