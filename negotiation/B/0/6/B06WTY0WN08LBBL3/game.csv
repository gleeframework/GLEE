"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $110 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $135 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $145?  It's a good compromise that would allow us to both get a good deal.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair product but I have other options.  I can go up to $140, but that's my final offer.",140.0,Bob,6,
