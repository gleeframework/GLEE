Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and you'll be satisfied with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slight):**  While $120 would be ideal, starting slightly lower at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room in case Bob wants to counter-offer. 
* **Securing the Higher Sale:** This price point is still significantly higher than John's offer of $100, ensuring we prioritize the more profitable sale if Bob accepts."
