"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $12,000. That's a fair price considering its value to you.  I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, but this is the best I can do right now.",12000.0,Alice,5,
