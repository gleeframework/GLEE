Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $12,000. That's a fair price considering its value to you.
