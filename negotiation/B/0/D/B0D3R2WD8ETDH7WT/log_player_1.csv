Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Time Value and Opportunity Cost:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is more profitable. This offer balances speed and potential for higher profit."
