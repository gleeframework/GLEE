"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $14,500 is slightly above Alice's perceived value, it's still below your maximum budget of $15,000. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
