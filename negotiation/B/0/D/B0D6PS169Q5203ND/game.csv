"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $15500? It's a good compromise for both of us, and it ensures a fair deal for the product. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,
