"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium, but also make sure I'm not pricing myself out of a deal right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's offer by $150,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  This shows I'm serious about a deal, but not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still within my negotiation range. I believe I can get even closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's offer by another $25,000. I'm showing him that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. With only a few rounds left, I want to see if we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $10,000 away from my last counteroffer, and we're running out of rounds.  It's better to take the $1,310,000 now than risk losing the deal entirely or having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
