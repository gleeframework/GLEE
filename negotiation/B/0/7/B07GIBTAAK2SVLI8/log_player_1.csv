Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but gives him room to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob, highlighting that he gets a good deal even at this price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's perceived value. By offering a reasonable starting price and being open to negotiation, I increase the chances of reaching a deal while still potentially getting closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on how close it is to my desired price and how likely he is to walk away.
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I'll be prepared to switch to John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
