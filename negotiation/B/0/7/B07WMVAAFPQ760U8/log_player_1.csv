"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point, and it's a bit risky.  I'm setting the price high, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested. This will help me gauge his potential value for the product and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $14000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if I can push for a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $14500 might be a bit steep for me. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, like $14200? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I initially wanted, it's close enough to my target that it's worth it to avoid further negotiation and potentially risking losing the deal entirely.  Four rounds in, it's getting close to the point where selling to John might become more appealing."
