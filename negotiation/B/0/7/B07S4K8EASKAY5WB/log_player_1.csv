Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $145 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so offering it above that price creates potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, giving me a strong fallback position.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $145 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but wants a slightly better deal. 

By starting high, I increase my chances of either:

* **Securing a high sale price from Bob** 
* **Falling back on my guaranteed sale to John**"
