"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $145 for it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $145
* **Your Maximum:** $120
* **John's Offer:** $120

While Alice's offer is closer to her value, you can get the product for $25 less from John. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
