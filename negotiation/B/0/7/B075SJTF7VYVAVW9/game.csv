"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget. However, $130 doesn't quite cover my minimum asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to go up to $130, which is closer to my budget. Could we possibly meet at $132? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still getting a good value for the product.",132.0,Bob,4,
