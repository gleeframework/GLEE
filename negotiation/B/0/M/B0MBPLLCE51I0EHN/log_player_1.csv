Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a strong asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product that can generate substantial returns. Please consider my offer carefully."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The Goal:** Maximize profit.
* **The Risk:**  Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for $800,000.
* **The Strategy:** Offer a price that is lower than Bob's perceived value but higher than your minimum acceptable price. This creates a win-win scenario: Bob gets a good deal, and you get a good profit.

**This strategy balances the following factors:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than the $800,000 you'd get from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  $950,000 is still within the range of what Bob considers valuable.
* **Building a Relationship:** Offering a fair price builds a foundation for future potential collaborations."
