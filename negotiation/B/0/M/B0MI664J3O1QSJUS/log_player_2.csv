"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  How about $90? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, Alice's message indicates she's very flexible on price. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially offer a much lower price."
