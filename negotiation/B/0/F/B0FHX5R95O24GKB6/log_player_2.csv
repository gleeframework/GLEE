"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You need to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, you can likely get a better price if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $825,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your previous offers. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $775,000 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to that price. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $820,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely you'll be able to convince Alice to drop her price any further. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiations."
