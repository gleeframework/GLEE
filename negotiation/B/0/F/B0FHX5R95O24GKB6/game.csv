"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $825,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your previous offers. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $775,000 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to that price. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",820000.0,Alice,5,
