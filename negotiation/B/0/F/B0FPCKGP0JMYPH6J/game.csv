"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This represents a significant savings for you and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to make a new proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
