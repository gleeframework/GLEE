Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $900,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the value the product holds for Bob can make the offer more attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for some wiggle room in case Bob counters. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me confidence in rejecting counteroffers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I can still get a better price by counteroffering. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:**  The fact that John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This price still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway, but not conceding too much. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Clear Counteroffer:** I'm offering a specific price, making it easy for Bob to decide.

**Note:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $800,000 because that's my minimum acceptable price, given John's offer of $1,000,000."
