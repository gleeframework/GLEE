"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but $250 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $180. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $100. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $140. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $140 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $120, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",120.0,Bob,6,
