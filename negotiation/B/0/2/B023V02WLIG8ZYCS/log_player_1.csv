Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:** $1,325,000 is significantly higher than John's standing offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob keeps returning to $1,325,000, suggesting this is his upper limit. Further haggling might frustrate him and risk the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation means delaying the sale. Accepting now secures a good profit immediately."
