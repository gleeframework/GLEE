"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking for $120. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $150, so you have a fallback option.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a lower price. You might be able to get a deal closer to your $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $110? It's still a good price considering what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your limit:**  While you wanted to pay $100, Alice is now offering $110. This is still within your $150 limit, and it's closer to what you were willing to pay.
* **No need to risk a counter-offer:** There's a chance that Alice will reject another counter-offer, and you could end up having to buy from John for $150. 
* **Saving some money:** You're still saving $40 compared to buying from John, making this a worthwhile deal."
