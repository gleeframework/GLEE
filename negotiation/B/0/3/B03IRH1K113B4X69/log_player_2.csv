{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value justifies a price higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's comfort zone.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can leverage the knowledge that John is selling the product for $10,000 as a point of reference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still above my budget.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $13,000. I believe this is a fair price, and it's closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14,500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to his goal, but $14,500 is still too high. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower, or consider going to John for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you've made concessions, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his budget.  Given that he has limited rounds remaining, and John is offering a much lower price, Bob should buy the product from John. This guarantees a good deal and prevents any further risk of a stalemate with Alice."
