"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident the product is worth $14000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product offers.",15000.0,Alice,5,
