"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person.  I'm asking for $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you have a chance to save even more money with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still above your desired price point. There's room for further negotiation before you need to resort to buying from John."
