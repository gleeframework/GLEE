"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $8500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9250. How about we split the difference and I pay you $9000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
