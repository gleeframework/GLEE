"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a game changer. My initial offer is $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's try $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. Your offer is still a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,087,500? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to that number. How about $1,082,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1082500.0,Bob,6,
