Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Here's why:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate and potentially achieve a higher sale price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** By starting high, I can quickly determine if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to pay a premium. 
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always move on to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000 at this point. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 

**My next counteroffer will aim to bridge the gap.** I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise and how confident I am in my ability to get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This represents a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** $1,300,000 is a significant amount of money, and I'm not willing to go lower without seeing a strong counter-argument from Bob.
* **Signal Flexibility:** By reducing my price, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and whether he's willing to meet me halfway.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, and it's significantly higher than what I'd receive from John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
