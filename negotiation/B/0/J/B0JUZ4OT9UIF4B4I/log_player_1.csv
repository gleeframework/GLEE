"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective.  While I value the product, $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close the deal. What do you think?
