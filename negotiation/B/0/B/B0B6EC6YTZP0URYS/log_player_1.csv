Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Beat Bob's Value:** Offering it at $100 or less guarantees a loss since John will pay $150.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject $145. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at $150, it's a calculated risk to start high and potentially secure a higher profit."
