{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

We are at the penultimate round of negotiations. We've pushed Alice as far as we could, and it seems she's not willing to go lower than $1,200,000. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still within our budget, and we're running out of time to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's better to secure the product now and avoid risking missing out altogether."
