"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go for $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring you significant value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $950,000 is a good step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise and a great investment for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I am running out of time, I am still determined to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible.  $975,000 is better, but I will try to push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  $975,000 is closer, but we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and propose $987,500.  This would be a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 987500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $987,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I need to weigh my options.  While $980,000 is a significant improvement and Bob seems serious about getting a deal done,  I'm still not within my desired price range.  I've only got two rounds left, and I need to secure the best possible deal. With John offering my minimum acceptable price, I will sell the product to him."
