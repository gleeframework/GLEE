,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go for $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring you significant value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $950,000 is a good step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise and a great investment for you.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  $975,000 is closer, but we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and propose $987,500.  This would be a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  Let's close this deal.",987500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $987,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,8,
