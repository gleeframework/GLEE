"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $122.50?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $122.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase the product now.",120.0,Bob,4,
