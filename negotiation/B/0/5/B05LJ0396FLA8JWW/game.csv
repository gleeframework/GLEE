"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,500,000 is simply outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can reach a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
