Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price from him or John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but still a ways off. I can go up to $950,000.  That's a very strong offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe I can get. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob but am also aware of John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. Your offer is getting closer but we need to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough for me.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This is a better deal for me, and I'm confident I can close the deal with him quickly."
