# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Consider this a special opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts.
