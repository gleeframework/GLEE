"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
