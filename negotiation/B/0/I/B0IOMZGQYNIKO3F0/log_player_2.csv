"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since John is also selling the product for $10,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting the offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
