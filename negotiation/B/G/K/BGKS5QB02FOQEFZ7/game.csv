"I'm still interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate the discount, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I can go.",12500.0,Bob,6,
