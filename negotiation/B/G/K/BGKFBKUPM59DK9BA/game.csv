,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $11,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to secure the product for $10,750.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  If you're serious about buying this product, I'm offering it to you for $10,875.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  I'm very close to making a decision, but $10,875 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  This feels like a fair price that reflects both of our needs. What do you say?",10800.0,Bob,6,
