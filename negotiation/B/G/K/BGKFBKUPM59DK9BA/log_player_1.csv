Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to secure the product for $10,750.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  If you're serious about buying this product, I'm offering it to you for $10,875.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  I'm very close to making a decision, but $10,875 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  This feels like a fair price that reflects both of our needs. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more. It's better to secure a sale now than risk ending up with nothing."
