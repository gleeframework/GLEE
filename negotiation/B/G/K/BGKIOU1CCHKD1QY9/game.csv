"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. Can we discuss further?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,500 is closer, I'm still a bit high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer for now.",11000.0,Alice,5,
