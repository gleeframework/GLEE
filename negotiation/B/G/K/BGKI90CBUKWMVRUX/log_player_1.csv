Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value of the product to me while leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum price of $1,500,000, Bob's offer is too low. I want to see if I can get a better price from him before I settle. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,800,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm still above my minimum price. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's higher than what John is offering, and it's worth taking the deal to avoid further negotiation."
