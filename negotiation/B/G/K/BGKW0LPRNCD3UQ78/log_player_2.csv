Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $1500000 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to drop my price to $1550000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen.

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I want to pay. Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price.  If she won't go lower, I can always buy from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,537,500 is still higher than my maximum budget.  Although it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm running out of time. It's better to purchase the product from John for $1,500,000 to save some money and ensure I get the product."
