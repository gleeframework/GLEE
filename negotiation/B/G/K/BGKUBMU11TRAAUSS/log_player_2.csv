"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it saves you some money! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is cheaper than the $150 she values it at, you know you can get the product for a better price from John ($80)."
