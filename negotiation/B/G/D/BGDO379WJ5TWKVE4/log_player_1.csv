Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim to get as close to that price as possible from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price just below your guaranteed selling point creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
