"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How about $125? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $125 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You should reject this offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
