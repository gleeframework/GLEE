{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $137.50 is a better price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I can't go as low as $137.50, I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a great price for the product and allows us both to make a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $155, but I'm still a bit stretched on that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $137.50, which would be $141.75. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $141.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $141.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'd rather sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit than continue negotiating with Bob."
