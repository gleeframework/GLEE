Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This offer reflects the market value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still provides significant value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price allows for a substantial profit for you while ensuring a good deal for me. I believe this is a fair compromise that demonstrates our shared interest in reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need. Selling to John guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
