"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This initial offer allows for potential concessions in later rounds without dropping below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage if Bob proves unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also below my initial offer, so it's not a promising sign for future negotiations. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still achieve a better deal with Bob, especially since he is willing to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer is Still Available:**  My fallback option with John remains available if I'm unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Concessions:**  I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, indicating a willingness to compromise while still remaining above Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he rejects, I know I need to be more aggressive in lowering the price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still significantly above Bob's perceived value and have the option to sell to John if negotiations break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $8,500 is still far below my ideal outcome and my initial offer. 
* **Sign of Increasing Willingness:** The fact that Bob is making counteroffers suggests he's willing to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer is a Strong Safety Net:**  I can still secure a much better deal with John, which gives me confidence in holding out for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($10,000).
* **Testing the Limit:**  I'm trying to gauge how close Bob is to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds, so I need to start making concessions. However, I am still holding out for a price closer to my ideal.
* **John's Offer is Still Available:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000, giving me leverage to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're now in Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Even though I'm making concessions, there's no guarantee he'll meet me halfway.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me a significantly better deal than accepting Bob's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing."
