"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's worth seeing what Alice is willing to do before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,800 is a good price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to go lower, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility. It's worth seeing if he can squeeze out an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $10,600? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already saved a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation could potentially get him a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation going on for too long is high.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking further delays or a lost opportunity."
