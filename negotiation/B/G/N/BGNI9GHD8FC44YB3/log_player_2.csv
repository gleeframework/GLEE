"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her product value, it's still above Bob's maximum price. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range considering his maximum price. This aggressive counteroffer aims to quickly get the negotiation moving in Bob's favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's desired price point. While it's tempting to accept, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. He has 7 rounds remaining and can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for this product. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for a lower price but is also acknowledging that he is approaching his limit. This counteroffer is a compromise that shows his willingness to reach an agreement while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  The ""final offer"" statement creates pressure on Alice, hoping she'll accept to avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I'd like. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is very close to Bob's maximum price.  While there's still some room for negotiation, the risk of losing the deal with Alice outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount compared to the initial asking price.  He can always try to get a better deal in the future if this purchase doesn't work out."
