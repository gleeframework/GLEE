"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for this product. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I'd like. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
