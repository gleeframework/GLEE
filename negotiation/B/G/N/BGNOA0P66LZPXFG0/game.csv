"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price that is fair for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $975,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle on $1,025,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'll make.  If you don't accept, I'll have to move on.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
