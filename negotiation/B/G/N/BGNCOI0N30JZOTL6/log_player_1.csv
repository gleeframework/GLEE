Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Let me counter with an offer of $115. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $115 is a solid profit.  Taking a guaranteed good offer now outweighs the risk of him walking away in future rounds."
