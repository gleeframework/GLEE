"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1350000. How about we meet in the middle at $1325000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've made several concessions, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me.
