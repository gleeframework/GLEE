$20,000 is way over Bob's budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He'll counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his goal."
