"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is well above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards. It also establishes my initial position and sets the stage for the negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, so I'm not rushing to sell to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I won't accept it. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to give up a significant portion of my product's worth to him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,500,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to John's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground here that Bob is willing to accept. I want to make sure Bob understands that I am willing to negotiate, but I also need to make sure I get a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I believe there's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can reach a price that's closer to my minimum value. While John's offer is tempting, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $1,400,000.  This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but it's still a significant amount of money for him. With 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, so I want to find a sweet spot that Bob will accept. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low.  I'm still confident I can get a better price, and I don't want to settle for less than $1,350,000. I have 4 rounds left, and John's offer is a solid fallback. I'm going to counter in the next round and see if I can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer. I'm confident that I can get this price, as I'm not far off from his last offer, and it's also within my acceptable range.  It's getting down to the wire, so I want to make sure I close a deal, but I won't settle for less than this.  We'll see if this works, or if I need to take John's offer."
