Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.  
* **Testing the Waters:** A price of $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide if you want to come down to a price closer to $1,000,000 or maintain a higher price."
