Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 90}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $86.50 is close, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement before I consider selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still not willing to go above $86.50. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product, and I'd like to finalize the deal at that price.

I'm going to sell to John. It seems like Bob is firm on his price, and I'm not willing to go lower than $87.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price,  $80 from John is still better than accepting Bob's offer."
