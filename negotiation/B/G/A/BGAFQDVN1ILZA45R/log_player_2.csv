* **Closing the Deal:** The message emphasizes a desire to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Alice to agree.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $920000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Close But Not There Yet:** Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob is only $8,000 away from his last offer.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds left, Bob should push for a better deal. There's still a chance that Alice will agree to a lower price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a backup option, it's not the ideal outcome. Bob should try to get a better price from Alice.

**Strategy:** In the next round, Bob should counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his last offer, but still lower than Alice's current price. He needs to convince Alice that this is a fair compromise and that it's time to close the deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and close this deal at $915,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction.  I'm ready to move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  With only two rounds left, Bob is making a strong final push.  The offer is only $5,000 higher than his last offer and is showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Time Pressure:** Bob emphasizes that this is a fair price and that he is ready to move forward, putting some pressure on Alice to accept.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer remains a safety net, but Bob wants to avoid paying that much if possible.  He is trying to squeeze out a bit more savings.
* **Confidence:**  The message shows confidence in the offer being fair and encourages Alice to close the deal.

This strategy aims to push Alice towards accepting an offer close to Bob's target while still leaving a small buffer if Alice becomes more stubborn."
