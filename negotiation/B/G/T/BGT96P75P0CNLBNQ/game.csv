"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $80 or less if possible.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price considering the quality.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but I'd really like to get it for less than that if possible. Can you consider a lower price?",140.0,Bob,4,
