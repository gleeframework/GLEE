{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but also wants to be realistic. Offering $1,050,000 is a strong starting point, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying, but also aiming for a price closer to her value. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to push for a lower price without risking buying from John for a much higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.  $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise, likely tempting Alice to accept while still saving Bob a significant amount compared to John's offer."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a significant saving compared to John's offer, and further negotiation may not yield much more. With limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures the product within Bob's budget while minimizing the risk of losing the deal to John."
