Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 and $1,200,000. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of Bob's valuation.
* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate, and your message reflects that.
* **Focus on Value:** You're not just selling a product; you're selling its ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate you down. Having a firm understanding of your minimum and being willing to walk away if necessary is crucial.
* **One-Time Deal:** This scenario assumes a single negotiation round. In reality, there might be multiple back-and-forths."
