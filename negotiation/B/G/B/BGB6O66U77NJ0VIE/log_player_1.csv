Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, any price Bob accepts above that is a win. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at $1,100,000 gives him a chance to make a profit of $100,000 if he uses the product in a way that realizes its full value to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested but finds the initial price a bit too steep."
