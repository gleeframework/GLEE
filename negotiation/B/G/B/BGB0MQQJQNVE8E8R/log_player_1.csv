{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, but it's important to remember that:

* **You have a floor:** You won't go lower than $1,000,000.
* **John is your safety net:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always go to John. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you encourage Bob to engage and potentially offer a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is your minimum, Bob's offer is too low. We'll try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, reflecting the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to our desired price, and we're running the risk of him walking away or us having to settle with John for $1,000,000.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
