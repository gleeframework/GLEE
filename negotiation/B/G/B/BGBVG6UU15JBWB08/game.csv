"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1550000.",1550000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1550000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1650000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
