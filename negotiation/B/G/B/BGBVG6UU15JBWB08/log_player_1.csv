{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,700,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1550000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,650,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'd like to propose $1625000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,625,000 is a good deal.  It's a significant amount of money and it's better than selling to John for a lower price. It's also likely I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
