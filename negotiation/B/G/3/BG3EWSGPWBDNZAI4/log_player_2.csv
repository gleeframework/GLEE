"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still too high.  You want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's product is worth $120 to her, so I'm offering a price that's slightly higher than that but still significantly lower than her initial offer.  This gives her some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a considerable amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and a significant improvement over her first offer.  While I would prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's $150 price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
