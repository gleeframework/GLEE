"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a generous offer, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a slightly lower price to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to your business.
