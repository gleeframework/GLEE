"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, I'm really only able to go up to $10,500 at this time.  This would still allow you a profit, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain a certain level of profitability for my business. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly. How about $11,000 for the product? This would still provide a reasonable profit for us while remaining within your budget. Let me know if this revised offer works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
