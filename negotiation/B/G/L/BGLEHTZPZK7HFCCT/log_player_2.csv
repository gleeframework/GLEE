"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you for a reasonable premium.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to me,  paying $1,200,000 would be a significant loss. I'll try to negotiate a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows her I'm serious about buying but also sets the stage for further negotiation. I'm hoping she'll be willing to compromise, as she needs to sell the product for at least $1,000,000 to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll accept $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and potential for you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm still hoping to get a better deal, especially since I can always buy from John for $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually increasing my offer. $950,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current price. It's still a good deal for me, and I hope it's appealing enough to Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum for this product.  This price reflects its unique value and potential for you. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly what I'd pay for the product from John.  This is a good deal for me, and there's no point in continuing to negotiate. I'm happy to accept and finalize the deal with Alice."
