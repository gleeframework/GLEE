Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this offer reflects the significant value it holds."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start negotiations high. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,400,000 price gives some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Value justification:** You briefly mention ""significant value"" to subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, without revealing your absolute bottom line.

**Goal:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
