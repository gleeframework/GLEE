"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John would sell it for.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start with a counteroffer that's beneficial for you. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds. 
* **Pressure:** This low offer also signals to Alice that you're serious about getting a good price and might be willing to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price reflects the true potential of this product. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but $1,400,000 is still way too high. We need to show her we're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,400,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  I can go up to $900,000, but that's my limit for now."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing Alice we're willing to negotiate by increasing our offer, but it's a small increase to show we're serious about a lower price point. 
* **Firm Limit:**  By stating  ""$900,000 is my limit for now"", we're creating a sense of urgency and putting the ball in her court. 
* **Staying below John's Price:**  We're still comfortably below our fallback option of buying from John for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, but the value this product holds is significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair and final offer considering its potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  While she says it's a ""final offer,""  it's unlikely she won't negotiate further. We're still over our budget and can apply more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. However, that price is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from another seller for that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:** We're now putting our cards on the table and revealing our backup plan. This puts significant pressure on Alice.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we're signaling that we're serious and ready to walk away if she doesn't accept. 
* **Still Room for Alice's Profit:** Alice can still make a $200,000 profit if she accepts our offer, which is a good deal for her."
