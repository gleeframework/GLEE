Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. However, that price is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from another seller for that price.

{

}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met his maximum valuation of the product. While we could reject and counteroffer, he's signaled this is his final offer and he has alternatives. Accepting the $1,000,000 offer is better than risking him walking away and getting $0 or accepting John's offer for $1,200,000 (which only nets us $0 after considering the product's worth to us)."
