"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something I value at least $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a bit less.  How does $110 sound?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product from John for $100, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $110."
