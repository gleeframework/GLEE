Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still maximizing your profit. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** You're not just stating a price; you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $925,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, but still nets you a significant profit over your guaranteed offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting point might be preferable. 

**Remember:**  The key is to find a balance between maximizing your profit and offering a price Bob finds reasonable."
