"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
