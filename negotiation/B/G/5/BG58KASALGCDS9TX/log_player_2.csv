"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice is still above your budget. While a compromise might be possible, it's getting close to your maximum limit and you don't want to risk going over.  Jhon offers a guaranteed price within your budget, making him the safer option at this point."
