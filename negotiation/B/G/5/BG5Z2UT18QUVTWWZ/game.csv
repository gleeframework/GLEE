"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8800?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to be closer to $9000 to make this work for me. How about $9200?  I believe that's still a good deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9200 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9100?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",9100.0,Bob,4,
