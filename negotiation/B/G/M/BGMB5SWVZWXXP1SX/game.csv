"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
