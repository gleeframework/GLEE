Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
