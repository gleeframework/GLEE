"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $90. How about we compromise at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about we aim for $96? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to what I'm looking for.",96.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I still think we can do better. Would you be willing to go down to $94?",94.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not sure I can go as low as $94. How about we meet in the middle at $97? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and it's still a great deal for you.",97.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm not sure $97 is the best deal for me. Would you be willing to go down to $95?,95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we try $98? It's just a dollar more than my previous offer, but it's still a great deal for you.",98.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $95. I think we're close, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,10,
