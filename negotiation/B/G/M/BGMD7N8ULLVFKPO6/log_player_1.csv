Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can offer $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's shown a willingness to negotiate, $7,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $7,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,800. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I can offer $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still lower than my minimum price. I've already made several concessions and we're starting to run out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob."
