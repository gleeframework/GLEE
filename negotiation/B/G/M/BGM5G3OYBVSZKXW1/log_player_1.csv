"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, as a compromise.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can achieve a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,900,  but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of $8,900. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,700 is only $200 away from his initial offer and less than $1,000 away from my minimum. This indicates he's not willing to budge much further. While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high.  Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is significantly more profitable and minimizes the risk."
