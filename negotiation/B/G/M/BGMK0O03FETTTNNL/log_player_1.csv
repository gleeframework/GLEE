Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

**Why not ask for the full $1,200,000?**

While tempting, it's generally not a good negotiation tactic to start at the absolute maximum.  It leaves no room for Bob to feel like he got a deal, which can sometimes make buyers walk away even if the price is within their budget."
