"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
