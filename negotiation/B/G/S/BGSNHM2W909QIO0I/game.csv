"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $825,000. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,4,
