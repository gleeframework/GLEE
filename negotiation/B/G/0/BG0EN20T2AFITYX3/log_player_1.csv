Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the product's worth and hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I still have room to negotiate with Bob and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,600,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This takes into account the value of the product and our potential for a long-term partnership. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to settle. I'm confident that with some more negotiation, I can get a higher price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. How about $1,637,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $1620000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,620,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum value and  I'm running out of time.  It's better to close the deal with Bob now than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for a lower price."
