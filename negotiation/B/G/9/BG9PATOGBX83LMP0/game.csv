"I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $137.50. It's a slight bump from my previous offer, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality. Let me know if that works for you.",137.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about $138? It's a small bump, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.",138.0,Alice,7,
