Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $137.50. It's a slight bump from my previous offer, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about $138? It's a small bump, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
