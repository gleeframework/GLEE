{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still only able to go up to $12,500.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.  Let's close this deal and get this product to me."", ""product_price"": 12500}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiations are getting close to his limit, but Alice is still holding out for a higher price. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $12,000. This guarantees him the product at his maximum budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
