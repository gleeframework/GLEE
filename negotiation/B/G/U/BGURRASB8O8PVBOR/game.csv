"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're highlighting. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it while staying within my financial constraints.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to offer the product to you for $9,000. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and your willingness to pay.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and my current budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. To further align our interests, I propose a price of $8,900 for the product. This price not only respects your budget but also maintains a reasonable margin for us. Let's aim for a win-win solution.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting very close! While I appreciate your compromise, $8,900 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $8,800. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward!",8800.0,Bob,6,
