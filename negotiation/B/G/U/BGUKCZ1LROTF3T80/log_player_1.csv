Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  I'm aware that Bob might reject this, but we can then negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully is more appealing to Bob than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is higher than John's offer of $15,000. It's also a good profit margin for me. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
