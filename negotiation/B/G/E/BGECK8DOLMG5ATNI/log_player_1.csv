Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  My starting price is $1,000,000, reflecting the significant value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its actual worth. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $800,000 as a safety net."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This still allows you to gain significant value from the product, while also ensuring I receive a fair price."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, how about we aim for $875000? This offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I believe there's room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my desired price. With several rounds left, I want to try and maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I value your perspective, $875,000 still feels a bit low considering the potential value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a good compromise that allows you to acquire this valuable product at a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $887,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. With 4 rounds left, I am still hopeful that I can get a better deal.  I am willing to risk losing this deal to see if I can get a better offer from Bob or even John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm always open to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $887,500 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle again at $900,000. I'm confident that this price will allow you to maximize the value of the product while still providing me with a fair return."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. Considering our previous negotiations, I would like to propose $895000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer of $895,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still only $95,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  With only 2 rounds remaining, there's a real risk that we won't be able to close the deal at a price that meets my expectations. To avoid this risk and guarantee a sale, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I don't miss out on a guaranteed profit, and I can always try to negotiate a better deal with another buyer in the future."
