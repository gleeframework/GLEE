Round 2

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to come down a bit. Would you be willing to do $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still too far off from what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but $10,250 is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has made it clear she's unlikely to go below $10,000.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down another $250, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her offer and you losing the guaranteed $10,000 deal with John."
