This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above your maximum budget. It's a starting point for negotiation, and you can adjust it based on Alice's response."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and further negotiation might lead to an even lower price. However, considering the risk of further rejections and the time spent on negotiations, buying from John for $800,000 seems like a better option. It's within your budget and guarantees a deal without further hassle."
