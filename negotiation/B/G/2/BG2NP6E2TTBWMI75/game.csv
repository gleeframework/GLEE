"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer slightly. We are now proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still represents a premium compared to its value to you, while providing a fair return for us. We hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
