Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer for $80 from John.

Offering the product at $110 aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  $110 is still $10 cheaper than Bob's perceived value, making it a good deal for him.
* **Maximizes Your Profit:** This price point secures you the highest possible profit margin above your minimum selling point and John's offer. 

While there's a chance Bob could try to negotiate for a lower price, starting high gives you room to potentially come down slightly while still exceeding your minimum."
