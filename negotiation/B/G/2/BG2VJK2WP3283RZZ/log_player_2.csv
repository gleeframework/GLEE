"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to sell it for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get the product for a better price. Alice is likely open to further negotiation."
