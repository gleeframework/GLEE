Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can leverage this to set a higher initial offer with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  A starting price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than your guaranteed sale price. 

**Important Note:** Even though John offers a safety net, pushing for a much higher price with Bob could backfire.  There's always a chance he'll walk away.  This offer balances risk and potential reward."
