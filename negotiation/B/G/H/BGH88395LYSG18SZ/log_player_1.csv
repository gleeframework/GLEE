Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the product's value to me, implying it's a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This approach aims to start a negotiation while setting a strong initial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below my ideal price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for a higher counteroffer from Bob. He acknowledged the product's value to me, so there's hope he'll increase his bid.
* **Risk assessment:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation with Bob to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm unable to accept $1,100,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise by coming down to $1,150,000, but it's still a significant profit for Bob. 
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me, justifying my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open. 

By offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price while still benefiting me, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still not comfortable going above $1,100,000. I believe $1,050,000 is a reasonable price for both of us, given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer is getting too close to his own perceived value, and I'm unlikely to get a much higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While further negotiation is possible, the risk of going back and forth is not worth the potential reward. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob.

It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
