``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, aiming to create a sense of urgency and incentivize him to consider the offer.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows you to make a significant profit, while also giving me a fair return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-proposing:** I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counter-offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.

* **Moving towards my goal:**  $950,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, bringing us closer to my desired price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $935,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come away with a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm suggesting a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his latest offer and my previous one. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still remaining firm on my desired price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, I am not comfortable settling for $915,000 yet. I still have 4 rounds remaining, and I believe I can push for a better deal.  I'm not in a rush to close the deal, and I want to make sure I get the most value for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close. I appreciate your persistence. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. It's a great opportunity for you to secure the product at a good price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Conceding a small amount:** I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come to an agreement.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth and reiterate that this price is still advantageous for him.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  I use phrases like ""let's close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer before I potentially move on to another buyer. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I keep the message positive and friendly to keep the negotiation from becoming adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is only $910,000. It's just a $5,000 difference from his previous offer, which is not a significant enough increase to justify continuing the negotiation. 

Given that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to do so.  This ensures a much larger profit for me, even though it means losing the chance to potentially secure a slightly better deal with Bob."
