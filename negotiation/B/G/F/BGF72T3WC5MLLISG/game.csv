"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
