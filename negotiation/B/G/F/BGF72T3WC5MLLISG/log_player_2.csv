Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than $850,000.  It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate when there's a guaranteed option to buy for $800,000 from John."
