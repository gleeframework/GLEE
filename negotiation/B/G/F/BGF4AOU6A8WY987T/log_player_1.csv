"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be polite and friendly, while also establishing my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I need to try and get closer to that value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and John is a safe bet for my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $12,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product with this much value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,800. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm starting to run out of time and Bob is still quite a bit lower than my desired price. With only a few rounds left, I don't have time for further negotiation and risk ending up with an undesirable price. I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I achieve my minimum goal."
