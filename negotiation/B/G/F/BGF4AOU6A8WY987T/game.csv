,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $12,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product with this much value.  Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,5,
