"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's not just any item; it's a game-changer that could significantly impact your business or personal endeavors. Given its value and potential impact on you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth of $12,000 to you, I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure a high-quality asset at a competitive price. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you need further details about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value. While she claims it's worth $12,000 to you, you know your own valuation is lower. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of:

* **Alice making a counter-offer:** She might be willing to come down closer to her $8,000 valuation to make a sale. 
* **Sticking with John:** You have John as a backup option at $12,000, which is your maximum price.  

It's always better to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal before resorting to your backup plan."
