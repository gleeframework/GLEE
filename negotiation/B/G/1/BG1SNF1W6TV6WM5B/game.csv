"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. But I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,000. How about $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet at $9,500? This way, we both get a good deal, and I can finally get my hands on the product.  Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and $9,500. How about $9,875? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",9875.0,Alice,7,
