"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
