"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we try $107? That's a compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107 just doesn't work for me. My counteroffer still stands at $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to go up to $108, but I really think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at $108?",108.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still holding firm at $110. It's a great price for a product you clearly want, and it's the best I can do. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,7,
