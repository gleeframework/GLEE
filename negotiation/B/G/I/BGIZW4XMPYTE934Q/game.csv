"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $12,500 is still below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit stretched at $13,250. Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,125? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd be happy with the product.",13125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $13,125 is still a bit too high for me, though.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $12,750. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product.",12750.0,Bob,6,
