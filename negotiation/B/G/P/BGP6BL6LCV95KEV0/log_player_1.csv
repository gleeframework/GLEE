Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle so quickly. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my initial asking price, it's very close to my minimum value and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and settling for the lower price with John."
