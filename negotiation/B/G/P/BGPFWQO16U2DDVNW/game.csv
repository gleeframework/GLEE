"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product, which is closer to my limit. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
