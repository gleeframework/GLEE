Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $850,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle on $925,000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $900,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $900,000 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference and go with $912,500.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm afraid $912,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, as previously offered. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I wanted to get closer to $925,000, we've reached a point where further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.  $900,000 is a decent price and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower amount."
