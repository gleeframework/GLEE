"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's offer, it's indifferent whether Bob accepts or rejects. It doesn't matter who Bob buys from, the price is the same.  The prompt does not specify a preference for buying from one seller over another."
