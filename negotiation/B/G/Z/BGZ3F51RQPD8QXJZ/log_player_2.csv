"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the value you'll get from the product. I think you'll really benefit from it, and I'm confident you'll make a great decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is less than your $1,200,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you can likely get a better price by rejecting her initial offer."
