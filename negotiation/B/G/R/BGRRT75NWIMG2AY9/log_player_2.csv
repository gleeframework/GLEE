"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a price of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  $11,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. This product is worth $12,000 to me, but I believe that $9,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $10,000 is a good price for him, as it's below his maximum of $12,000 and still allows him to save $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While he might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
