Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $80 for the product to make a profit.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product for $110 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin for you. If Bob accepts, you make $30 more than selling to John.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net, ensuring you don't have to go below your minimum price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still offering Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept."
