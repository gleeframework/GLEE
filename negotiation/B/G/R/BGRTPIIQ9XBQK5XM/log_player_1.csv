"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more receptive.
* **No Specific Value:** I haven't revealed my minimum price, so Bob doesn't have any information about my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  While $150 is closer to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Value:** Selling to John for $120 is a last resort. I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $150 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $165. This would still be a great deal for you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 165}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counteroffer.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $165 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $155 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $155 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already on round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation decreasing the price is high.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I keep rejecting and counter-offering, I risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away, forcing me to sell to John for $120.  

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, accepting $155 ensures I make a profit and avoid potential losses."
