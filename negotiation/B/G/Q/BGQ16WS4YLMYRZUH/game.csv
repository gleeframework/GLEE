"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth $10,000 to you, but I'm hoping you see the value in it and are willing to pay a little extra. I'm confident you won't regret it! If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000, but I'd rather make a deal with you.",11000.0,Alice,1,
