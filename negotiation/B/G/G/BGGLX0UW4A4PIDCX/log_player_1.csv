Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
