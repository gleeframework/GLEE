"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $750,000."", 
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $1,000,000 maximum. 
* **Significant Counter:** Offering $750,000 is a 50% reduction from Alice's initial offer.  This signals that we're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price point. 
* **Leaving Room:** Alice is likely to counter, and this offer gives us space to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to our range, $1,300,000 is still above our maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to get the price down further.
* **John as Backup:** We can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if we can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're stating our absolute maximum price, making it clear that we're serious buyers but won't go beyond our limit. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By presenting this as our final offer, we're adding a bit of time pressure. Alice has to decide if she wants to make a deal now or risk losing the sale. 
* **John Option:** If Alice rejects this offer, we have the safety net of buying from John at our desired price."
