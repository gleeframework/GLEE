"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of offering $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair and reflects the product's true worth. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer, as it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances. I'm thinking of offering $1,150,000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you'll consider it. Let me know if this is something you're willing to accept.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
