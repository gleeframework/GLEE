Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not going to accept anything less than $1,200,000. I'm confident that John will be happy to purchase the product at that price."
