"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $600,000 is a good starting point, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $550,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while leaving room for us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $650,000. This price takes into account the product's value to you while also considering the time and effort I've invested in it. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $650,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  I'm eager to close this deal, so let's see if we can find a solution.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $620,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",620000.0,Alice,5,
