"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($600,000 vs. $800,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price.  It's also worth exploring if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $600,000 is a good starting point, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $550,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while leaving room for us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $650,000. This price takes into account the product's value to you while also considering the time and effort I've invested in it. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. While her offer is closer to my target, there's still some room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $650,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  I'm eager to close this deal, so let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $620,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $620,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $620,000 is getting closer to my target price of $550,000. While I'd still prefer to pay less, it's getting close to a point where I might lose the deal if I keep rejecting. 

Considering the time constraints and the risk of losing the deal, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
