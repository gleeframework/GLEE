"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You value the product at $1,000,000 and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This means you save $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You are still getting a good deal:** Even though you are paying more than Alice's valuation of $800,000, you are still getting the product at a price lower than your own valuation."
