"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,500 is a good deal, there's potential to get it even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start counter-offering and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount.  $7,500 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intention to negotiate while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still motivated to get the best possible price and is aware that Alice is also motivated to sell.  He can likely get a price closer to his target by continuing the negotiation.  While $8,000 is a good price, it's still above his ideal price point, and there's time to try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He increases his offer from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. However, he's still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer. This strategy shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying but isn't willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,200, which is a better price than her initial offer of $8,500. Bob has shown Alice his willingness to negotiate, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best course of action as it secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and potentially allows for more negotiation in the future if needed."
