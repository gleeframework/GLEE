"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $14,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your value for the product while ensuring I get a reasonable return. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",14800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,800 is still just a bit short of my target.  I'm willing to come down to $15,200.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's make this happen.",15200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but $15,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,900, and that's my final offer. Can you consider this?",14900.0,Bob,8,
