Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or price adjustments.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high ($200 or more) might scare Bob away immediately. Since the product is worth $150 to him, a $25 markup is a reasonable starting point. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message is phrased in a way that invites Bob to consider and respond, encouraging a dialogue. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, moving closer to her minimum of $150."
