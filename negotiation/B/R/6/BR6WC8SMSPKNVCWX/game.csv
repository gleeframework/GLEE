"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a great deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with this back and forth.  $9,800 is simply not enough for me to let go of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,025. This is my final offer, and if you're serious about buying, I hope you'll accept it. ",10025.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $10,025 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,800. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",9800.0,Bob,8,
