Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is still a decent amount, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher. I'd rather secure the sale and avoid further negotiation, especially since I can always sell to John for $150 as a backup."
