"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  My asking price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a high initial price to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $12,000 is a good starting point that allows for room to negotiate down if necessary, while still exceeding Bob's value. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am currently working with a budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:**  I can still potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget of $8,000, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This price still gives me a good return and hopefully, we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly higher price.
* **Time constraints:**  We're already in round 4, and there are only 6 rounds left.  I want to avoid risking the sale by continuing to negotiate and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, a successful sale with Bob could lead to future business opportunities."
