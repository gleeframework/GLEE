"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can definitely get a better price.  He has a lot of negotiating room since he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  He's offering $850,000, which is still above Alice's minimum but a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to move quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. He's willing to pay more than $800,000, and Alice is willing to accept less than $950,000.  By rejecting, Bob continues to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and Bob is saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move.  While Bob could potentially get a lower price with continued negotiation, there's a risk Alice will reject further offers or Bob could run out of rounds."
