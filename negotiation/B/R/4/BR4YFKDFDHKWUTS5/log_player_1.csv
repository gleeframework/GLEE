Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going under, ensuring we maximize profit.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above our guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses language that implies value and exclusivity, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating tactics. If we knew he was prone to hard bargaining, we might start higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If there's a time constraint, we might lower the price slightly to incentivize a quicker decision from Bob."
