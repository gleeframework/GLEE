"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage and potentially increase his interest.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to him, even without revealing specifics. This can make him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $10,000. This means there's still room for me to negotiate a better price.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate to sell and helps set a more favorable negotiation position for the next round.
* **Staying in Control:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain the power to set the next price point and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm not just rejecting his offer, I'm providing a counter-offer with a clear reason (meeting in the middle).
* **Moving Closer to Desired Price:**  The counter-offer of $14,000 is a compromise, but it brings me closer to my original asking price of $15,000. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm still showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but not desperate to sell. This helps me maintain control and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $13500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  Bob's counteroffer of $13,500 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $14,000, and well above my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  We are clearly making progress in our negotiations, and it's likely that further rounds might result in only minor price adjustments.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob might lower his offer in subsequent rounds, or I might be unable to reach my desired price. Accepting this offer minimizes that risk and secures a good sale price."
