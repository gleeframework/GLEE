Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, trying to get a higher price from Bob is the best way to maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
    *  Low enough to be potentially tempting for Bob if he sees significant potential value beyond his initial assessment. 
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to start a conversation rather than be a simple take-it-or-leave-it offer. This allows for Bob to potentially counter-offer and find a mutually agreeable price within my acceptable range.

**Important Note:**  I am willing to negotiate down to $1,200,000 with Bob, as going any lower would mean I'm better off selling to John."
