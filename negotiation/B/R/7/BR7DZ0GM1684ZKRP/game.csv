"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That's still a good price for you, and I think it's fair for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
