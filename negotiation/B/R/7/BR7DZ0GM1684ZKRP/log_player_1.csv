"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That's still a good price for you, and I think it's fair for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  I believe Bob is willing to pay more, and I want to see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $9,000, which is very close to my desired price. While I could potentially try to push for a little more, I'm worried about risking the deal and ending up with John's offer of $8,000. It's better to secure a good price than to risk losing the sale completely."
