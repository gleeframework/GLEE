,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,800?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,600 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,700. This is a final offer from me, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,5,
