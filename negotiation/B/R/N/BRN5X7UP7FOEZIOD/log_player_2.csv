"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer it to you for $1100000. Is this a more acceptable price for you?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer is still too high for your budget.  It's better to continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm very serious about purchasing this product and am prepared to offer a final price of $900,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can go, so I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your seriousness about purchasing the product, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is my final concession, and I hope you can see the value in this product and meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still offering a price higher than your budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you've already had several rounds and it's likely she won't come down to your desired price. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000."
