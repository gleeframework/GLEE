"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer it to you for $1100000. Is this a more acceptable price for you?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still outside my price range.  I'm very serious about purchasing this product and am prepared to offer a final price of $900000.  This is the absolute maximum I can go, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness about purchasing the product, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I can offer it to you for $1025000. This is my final concession, and I hope you can see the value in this product and meet me at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
