"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this opportunity.  I'm offering the product to you at a starting price of $950,000. Given its value, I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the response. I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I can be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the worth of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, the value of this product truly is substantial, and $775,000 remains below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000. I believe that's my final offer -  it represents a significant concession on my end while still reflecting the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  I can offer $800,000.  It's the most I can do, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
