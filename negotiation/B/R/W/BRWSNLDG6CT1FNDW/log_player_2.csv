Alice's initial offer is significantly above her value for the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and try to bring the price down."

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. It's a great product and worth a lot more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's make a deal.

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above her value and we have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. It's worth pushing for a better deal."

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is a good number, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,012,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept, but we are still in early rounds. I'll reject and counter slightly below her value to test her willingness to go lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $990,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your need for it.  I'm ready to close the deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to her value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well within my budget. It's time to accept and close the deal."
