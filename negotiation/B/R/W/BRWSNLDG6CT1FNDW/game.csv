"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. It's a great product and worth a lot more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that number.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is a good number, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,012,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $990,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your need for it.  I'm ready to close the deal now.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
