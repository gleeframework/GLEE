"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening offer that allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit beyond my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to move closer to my target price while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again, hoping to close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a strong counteroffer, just above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, we're getting close to the point where I might be better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not at my target price. I've reached a point where continuing negotiations with Bob might risk running out of rounds before securing a profitable deal. John's offer is my minimum acceptable value, guaranteeing a safe and timely sale."
