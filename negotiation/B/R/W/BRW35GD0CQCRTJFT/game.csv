"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9000 is simply too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my means.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10500 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at least $12500 for this to work.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're serious about this, and I appreciate your offer. However, $11000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is a significant compromise on my end. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's make this happen. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $13500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,8,
