"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is good, $14,000 is still a bit much for my budget. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $12,500? This gets us both moving forward.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,000, so I'll offer it to you for $12,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",12750.0,Alice,7,
