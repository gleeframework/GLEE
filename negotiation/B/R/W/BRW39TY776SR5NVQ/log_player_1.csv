Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher asking price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, I'm subtly justifying the higher price without revealing my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended, suggesting I'm willing to hear Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiate. 

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, there's no risk of losing money. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit."
