{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product,  $100 is significantly below my minimum. I will counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $120.  Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 120}
