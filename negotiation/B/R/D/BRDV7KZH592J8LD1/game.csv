"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still give you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
