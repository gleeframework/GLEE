Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120 to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm suggesting the product is worth $120 to Bob, subtly reminding him of its value to him. 
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and express his thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** The initial offer is high, leaving potential for a good profit.
* **Encourage Negotiation:** The open-ended question sparks interaction and creates a dynamic negotiation.
* **Maintain Control:**  I retain the ability to reject Bob's counteroffers and potentially accept John's offer if things don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I think the product is worth around $90 to me. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm hoping to get.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price.  I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer, hoping to get a better deal.  

**Next Steps:** I will now prepare a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm proposing a price of $105, which is halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I highlight the value for Bob by stating it's ""still a good deal"" for him.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing fairness and profit. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:**  By counter-offering, I keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Seek Compromise:** I propose a middle ground, aiming for a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Preserve Profit:**  $105 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a reasonable profit."
