"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $115 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to my target while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's split the difference and make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting me closer to my price range, and while I could try to haggle further, $105 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise."
