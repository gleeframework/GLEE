Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,300,000 is still too low, and I think I can get him to pay more."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me.  I've already negotiated with Bob for a few rounds, and I don't think I can get him to come up to my price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
