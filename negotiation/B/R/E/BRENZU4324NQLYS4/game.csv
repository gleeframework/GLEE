"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of the product's value, $600,000 undervalues its potential significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a bigger investment than I'm looking to make right now.  Could we consider a price of $800,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's find a compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product.  How about we settle at $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair price that reflects its worth.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. However, that price is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. To bridge the gap, how about we consider a final price of $1,125,000? This reflects the product's value while offering you a competitive price.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  My final offer is $950,000. If you're unable to accept that, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,8,
