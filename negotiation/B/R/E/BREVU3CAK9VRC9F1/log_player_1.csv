Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $19,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:** You know John will buy the product for $15,000, ensuring you won't make a loss. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, you've secured a great deal. If he rejects, you can consider a counter-offer or move on to John. 

**Important Note:** While the goal is to earn as much as possible, setting the price too high might discourage Bob entirely.  The offered price aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and the risk of losing the sale."
