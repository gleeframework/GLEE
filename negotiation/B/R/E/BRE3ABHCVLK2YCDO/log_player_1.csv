{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us.  My initial offer is $950,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is still a good amount, I can likely get closer to my target price of $950,000 if I continue negotiating. I have 9 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on my need to get at least $900,000 for the product.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $875000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that I can do better. I've only had 4 rounds, and I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm firm on my need to get at least $890,000 for the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'd like to propose a price of $880000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good compromise. I've successfully negotiated the price up significantly from Bob's initial offer, and I'm only a few rounds away from the end. It's not ideal to have to settle for a lower price, but it's better than going to John and accepting a significantly lower offer."
