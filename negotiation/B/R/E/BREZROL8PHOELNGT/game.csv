"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I've put a lot of value into this product and I believe it has the potential to yield even greater returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,800,000 is close, but I'm still seeking a slightly higher return on this product. How about we settle at $1,900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
