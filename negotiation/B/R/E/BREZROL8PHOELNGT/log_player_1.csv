Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?

While a higher price would be ideal, Bob is clearly signaling that this is his ceiling. Accepting the $1,750,000 offer secures a significant profit above the $1,500,000 baseline from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob and being forced to accept John's offer."
