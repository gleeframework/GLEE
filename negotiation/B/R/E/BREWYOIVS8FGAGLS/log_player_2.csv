"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so I'm sure I can get it cheaper. I don't want to pay $120 when I can potentially get it for less. I will reject Alice's offer and try to get a better deal.
