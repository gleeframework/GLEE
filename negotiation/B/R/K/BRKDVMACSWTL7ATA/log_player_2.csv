"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that I'm sure we can both agree on. I understand this product is worth $1000000 to you, so let's find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm proposing a price of $900000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
