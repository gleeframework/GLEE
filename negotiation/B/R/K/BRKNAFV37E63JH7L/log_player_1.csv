Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While meeting halfway sounds reasonable on the surface, it's based on an unrealistic initial offer. We need to steer him closer to a price that reflects the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the unique potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Hold Firm but Show Flexibility:** We don't want to accept Bob's low offer, but we also don't want to scare him off by being too inflexible.  A substantial counteroffer shows we're willing to negotiate while still valuing the product appropriately.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Continue to highlight the unique benefits and potential of the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $675,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly stuck on this ""meet halfway"" tactic, which is leading nowhere productive. We need to firmly steer him away from this pattern and demonstrate that his valuations are unrealistic. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.  We'll continue negotiating, but selling to John is looking increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your negotiation style, but consistently halving the price isn't a sustainable way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  The product's value is anchored in its potential, and I can't justify selling it for less than $1,200,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1200000 
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're drawing a line in the sand.  This price represents our absolute minimum - the same we'd get from John. 
* **Transparency:**  Being open about this being our final offer encourages Bob to be more serious and realistic if he's genuinely interested.
* **Alternative Option:**  While not stated explicitly, the fact that this matches John's offer implicitly signals to Bob that we have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on the product's value, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  Bob is now offering more than his initial valuation of $1,000,000, indicating serious interest.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, continuing to negotiate might yield only marginal gains beyond this point.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and secures a significant profit. 

While we could push for a bit more, Bob's latest offer represents a reasonable compromise and a strong return on the product."
