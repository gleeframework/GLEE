Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your negotiation style, but consistently halving the price isn't a sustainable way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  The product's value is anchored in its potential, and I can't justify selling it for less than $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.
