"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $140. This is a great price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $110, which would be $125. This is still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",125.0,Alice,5,
