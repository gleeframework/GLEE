"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm going to start high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. It's still a good distance from Bob's offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise, considering I'm not willing to sell for less than $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $140 is just above my minimum of $150. With only 6 rounds left, the risk of losing a deal with Bob and ending up with only $150 from John is too high. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
