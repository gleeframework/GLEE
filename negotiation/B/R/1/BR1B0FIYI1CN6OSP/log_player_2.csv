You can do better than $110. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105, though. Would you be interested in that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

$105 is a good price, especially since Alice rejected your counteroffer. It's within your budget and you can save $15 compared to buying from John."
