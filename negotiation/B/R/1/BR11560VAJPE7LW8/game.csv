"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think the initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This reflects the true value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $16,500. How about we try $15,750? I think this is a more reasonable price for the product.",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $15,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $16,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $15,900, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle again.",15900.0,Bob,6,
