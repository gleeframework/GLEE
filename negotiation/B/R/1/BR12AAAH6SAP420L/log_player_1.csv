{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to my minimum selling price. Bob's offer of $110 is very close to what I could get from John, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a stalemate and losing time. It's better to secure the $100 from John and move on."
