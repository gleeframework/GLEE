"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
