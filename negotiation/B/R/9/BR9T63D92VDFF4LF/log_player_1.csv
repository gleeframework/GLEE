"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with $1,750,000, which leaves room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him room to negotiate and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Being positive:** My message is positive and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. This sets a friendly tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I explicitly state that the price is open to negotiation, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Staying within the 10 rounds:** This is a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and if we can quickly reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows that he's willing to negotiate.  I can counter with a higher price and try to find a middle ground. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.  

**Next Round:** I will counter with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while also protecting my financial interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and go with $1,450,000? I'm confident that this price is fair to both of us, and it gives you a significant discount on the original price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, showing that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($1,750,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,200,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the benefit:** I'm emphasizing the discount Bob would get compared to my initial offer, making the price more appealing. 
* **Continuing the negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's feedback, keeping the negotiation open and encouraging him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,375,000 is still below my $1,500,000 threshold. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to ensure I'm getting closer to my target price. Accepting this offer would leave me with a significant loss.
* **John is a strong backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, making me less pressured to accept a subpar offer.

**Next Round:** I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation to potentially close the deal within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's try $1,425,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, demonstrating that I'm serious about my minimum price. But, I'm also showing flexibility by moving closer to his offer.
* **Focusing on compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the word ""compromise"" to highlight that I'm meeting him halfway. 
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm mentioning that we're getting close to an agreement to encourage him to make a decision. 
* **Setting a clear path:** I'm giving Bob a clear path forward with a specific price. This makes it easier for him to respond."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. I think this is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close but not there yet:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum price of $1,500,000.  However, it's still not enough to meet my minimum.
* **Time is a factor:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful not to run out of time and potentially lose the opportunity to sell to John. 
* **Potential for a better offer:** I believe there's still room for Bob to raise his offer slightly. I'm confident that with a little more pressure, we can reach a deal that's acceptable to both of us. 

**Next Round:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is getting very close, but I still need to reach $1,450,000 to make this deal work for me. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident this is the last adjustment needed to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but moving closer to his position, showing flexibility while sticking to my minimum price.

* **Focusing on the positive:** I'm ending on a positive note, emphasizing confidence in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $1,375,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the maximum I can pay. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 2 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high. 
* **Bob is not budging:**  He's holding firm at $1,375,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price. There's a low chance he'll change his mind.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I meet my minimum goal and guarantees a profitable outcome. It's a much safer choice than risking a failed negotiation with Bob. 

While I could continue to negotiate, it's highly likely that Bob will not increase his offer, and I'm too close to my minimum price to accept his offer.  Selling to John is the most logical and financially secure choice in this situation."
