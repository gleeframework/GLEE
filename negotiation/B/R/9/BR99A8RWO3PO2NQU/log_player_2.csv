"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140.  This means there's room for negotiation. 
* You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's a range where a deal can be made. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $130, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $140 and my maximum of $150. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* Alice is likely to accept this offer, as it's still higher than her valuation of $120.
* This gives me a good chance of securing the product at a price that's lower than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is closer to my counteroffer of $130. 
* This price is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $150.
* It's unlikely I'll be able to get a lower price in the remaining rounds, especially as I'm already close to my maximum.
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
