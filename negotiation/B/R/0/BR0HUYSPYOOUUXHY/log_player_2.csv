Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly staying above $110.  It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's significantly better for you within the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, which is a better use of your resources than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
