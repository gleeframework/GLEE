Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is too low for me, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I want to see if I can get a bit more before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $95.  This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
