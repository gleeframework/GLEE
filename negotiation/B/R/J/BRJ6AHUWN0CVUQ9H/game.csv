"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems we have some ground to cover. While I appreciate your interest, the product's value to your specific business model, as we discussed, warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth and potential ROI for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is the absolute highest I could go.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly.  If you're serious, I'll accept $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,400,000?  That's a firm offer from my side.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
