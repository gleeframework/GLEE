{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting allows me to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and based on my budget, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,060,000 for your product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal. While selling to John would yield a higher price, the risk of the negotiation collapsing or Bob finding another seller makes accepting Bob's offer the more reliable choice."
