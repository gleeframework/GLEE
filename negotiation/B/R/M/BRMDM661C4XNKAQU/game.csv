"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,600,000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay that price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I can't accept $1,400,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get closer to $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,450,000?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
