Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for Bob to consider the offer by mentioning its potential usefulness. This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  A higher initial price gives you more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Be friendly:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the conversation.
* **Provide value:**  Highlighting the product's potential usefulness might make Bob reconsider his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $150.** While $120 is a good deal for Bob, it's not a profitable deal for you.
* **You still have room to negotiate.**  You can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your minimum.
* **Selling to John guarantees your minimum price.** However, you might be able to secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you retain control of the negotiation and maintain the possibility of a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this deal work. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but it still keeps you above your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:** By saying it's a good price for both of you, you aim to foster a sense of fairness and make Bob more receptive.
* **Reiterate value:**  Reminding Bob about the product's value and potential happiness with it might sway him towards accepting your offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  The counteroffer significantly reduces the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Stay firm:** You're still aiming for a price that is beneficial to you, but you're showing flexibility.
* **Encourage a deal:** The message focuses on making the deal work, which might incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $150.** Even though you've come down from your initial asking price, $130 is not profitable for you.
* **You've already made significant concessions.** You've lowered your price twice, and it's unlikely that Bob will budge much further. 
* **Selling to John guarantees you a safe and profitable deal.** While you might be able to get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept your next counteroffer. Selling to John ensures you earn your minimum desired profit.

By choosing to sell to John, you prioritize a guaranteed profitable outcome over the risk of further negotiation."
