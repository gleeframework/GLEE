Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than $80, so he has some room to negotiate if he wants the product.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're not losing money if he accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately hitting your floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price, how about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
