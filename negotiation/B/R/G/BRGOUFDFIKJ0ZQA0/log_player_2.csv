You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $100.  You should try to get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. How about $92? It's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.

You can still get a lower price from Alice, so it's worth negotiating further."
