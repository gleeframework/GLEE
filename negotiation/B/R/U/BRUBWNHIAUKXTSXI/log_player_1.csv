Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's really worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $170."", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While the price is higher than what Bob values the product at ($120), it's not astronomically higher. This leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. 
* **Close to Your Guarantee:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out. You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk since you have a backup buyer."
