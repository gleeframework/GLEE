Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away if his counteroffer isn't reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm happy to negotiate, Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. Since John is also offering me $150, it makes sense to sell to him now.  There's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer, and it's better to secure the sale rather than risk losing both buyers."
