Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $7,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's still a good compromise.

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unwilling to go below her own value for the product ($8,000). Since John is offering the product for the same price, there's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice. It's time to move on and secure the product from John."
