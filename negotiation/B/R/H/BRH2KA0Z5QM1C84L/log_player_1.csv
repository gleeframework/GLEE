Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is appealing, but $1100000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While $1050000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the best I've received so far. It aligns with my minimum acceptable value for the product. Accepting this offer secures a deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or a potential sell to John."
