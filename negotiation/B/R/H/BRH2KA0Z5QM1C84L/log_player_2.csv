"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is appealing, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Bob starts with a bold counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price. This sets the tone for a negotiation and indicates his willingness to bargain.
* **Realistic Offer:** $950,000 is still a substantial amount, suggesting Bob values the product and is serious about buying it.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** The counteroffer provides ample room for further negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Jhon's Offer:**  $1,050,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Price:**  Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's still potential for a better deal, especially since Bob has already indicated a willingness to pay a significant price ($950,000).

**Next Steps:**  Bob should counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is Bob's final price, matching John's offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious and willing to walk away if she doesn't accept.
* **Reasoning:** Bob highlights the fairness of the price and the potential for both parties to benefit.
* **Pressure:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice, as she's likely to lose the sale if she refuses.

**Next Steps:**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob should proceed to buy from John, as further negotiations are unlikely to yield a lower price."
