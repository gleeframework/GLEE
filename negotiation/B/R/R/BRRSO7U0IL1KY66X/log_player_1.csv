"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This initial offer will give me a good sense of Bob's interest and potential negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not profitable enough for me. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm now within a range that I'm comfortable with. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob while still allowing me to make a profit."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm not yet willing to settle for a lower price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm making a final concession, bringing my offer down to $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering my minimum value and the limited rounds remaining."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but it's still lower than what I'd like.  With only two rounds left, it's not likely I can get a better price from Bob. It's time to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit of $800,000."
