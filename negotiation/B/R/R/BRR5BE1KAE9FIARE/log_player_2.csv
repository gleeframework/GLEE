Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we can likely get a better deal. We'll continue negotiating and push for a price closer to $1,000,000."

Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she won't budge and we'll end up paying John's higher price. Accepting at $1,090,000 is a good deal and saves us money compared to John."
