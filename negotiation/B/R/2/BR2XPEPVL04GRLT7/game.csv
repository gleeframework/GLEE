"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $950,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to make this deal work for both of us.  I'm confident that this product is worth a lot to me, but I need to be within my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
