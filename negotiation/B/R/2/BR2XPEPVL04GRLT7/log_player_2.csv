"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get it for less, especially since Alice is willing to discuss the price."

I'm confident that this product is worth a lot to me, but I need to be within my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still aiming for a lower price. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate further. A counteroffer will keep the negotiation going, potentially leading to a better deal."
