"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still within your budget and a good deal for you.  It's worth accepting her offer rather than risking further negotiation or settling for the standard price from John."
