Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're eager to acquire this product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $950,000 still falls short of my desired price point. To make this deal work, I need to see $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me to achieve my business goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.
