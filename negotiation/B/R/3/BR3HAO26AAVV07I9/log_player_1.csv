Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My starting price is $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still within reach of selling to John for $1,000,000. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're eager to acquire this product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $950,000 still falls short of my desired price point. To make this deal work, I need to see $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me to achieve my business goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. If we can't meet on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still too low for me.  I've reached my limit in terms of negotiating with Bob, and I don't want to risk further rounds and losing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
