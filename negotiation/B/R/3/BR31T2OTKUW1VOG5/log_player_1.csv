Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" subtly reinforces the high price without revealing specific details. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and invites Bob to engage in discussion,  leaving room for him to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed offer from John. 
* Bob might be turned off by a very high initial price, so reading his reaction will be crucial."
