Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be immensely beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product for $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential gain ($150,000).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high offer that Bob might reject and a low offer that leaves potential profit on the table."
