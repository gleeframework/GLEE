"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000, which reflects its significant worth.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in making a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefit to your business. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer,  $1000000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth.  Let's split the difference - I'm proposing $1025000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
