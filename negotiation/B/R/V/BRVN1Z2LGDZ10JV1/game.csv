,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm working with a tight budget, and I could manage around $7,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
