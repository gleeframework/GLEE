Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message is framed positively and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement above your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this initial high offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a secure backup."
