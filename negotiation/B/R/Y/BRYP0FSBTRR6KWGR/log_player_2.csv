It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Since Alice's offer is at your maximum, let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a significant discount, aiming for 10% off her initial offer. This shows we're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price considering my initial offer. It's a better deal than buying from John, and we still have room for further negotiation if needed. Let's accept and see if we can get her to go lower in future rounds."
