Bob should reject Alice's offer again. He can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price:** Alice is now offering $11,000, which is only $1,000 less than John's price.
* **Counter-offering is risky:** There's no guarantee Alice will accept another counter-offer, and she might even increase her price further.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice could drag out the process and ultimately cost Bob more time and effort.

Buying from John at $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's maximum budget is $12,000 and he's already gotten a good price reduction from John."
