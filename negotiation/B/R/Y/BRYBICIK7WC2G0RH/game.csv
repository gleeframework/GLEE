"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Can you consider my new offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $14000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $17000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
