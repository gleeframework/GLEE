"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be of great value to you. My initial price is $2000000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is far above my budget. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial price.  This is a fair offer that still allows me to cover my minimum requirement.  Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1375000. This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1375000 is still not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1600000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1600000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1450000.  This represents a fair compromise, and allows both of us to reach a deal. Let's finalize this and make it happen.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
