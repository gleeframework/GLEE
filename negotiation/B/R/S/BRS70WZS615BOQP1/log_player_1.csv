{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be of great value to you. My initial price is $2,000,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is far above my budget. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I will counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate but not at such a drastic reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial price.  This is a fair offer that still allows me to cover my minimum requirement.  Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1375000. This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate further but will counteroffer. I'm losing time and it's getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,375,000 is still not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1600000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1450000.  This represents a fair compromise, and allows both of us to reach a deal. Let's finalize this and make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we've only got 4 rounds left.  It's becoming risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity."
