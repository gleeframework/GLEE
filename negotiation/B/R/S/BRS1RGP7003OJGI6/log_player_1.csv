Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not overly aggressive and invites Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative buyer:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

**Important:** While John guarantees you $12,000, your goal is to maximize profit. It's worth aiming higher with Bob initially, even if it means some back and forth."
