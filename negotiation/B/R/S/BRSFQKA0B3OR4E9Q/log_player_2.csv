Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the last round, and I think this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit but is also willing to negotiate. While we might be able to push her a little further, there's a risk she'll become less willing to compromise. At $10,500, we're saving $4,500 compared to John's offer, which is a significant amount.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a worse outcome later."
