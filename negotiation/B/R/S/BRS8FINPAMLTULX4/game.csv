"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm selling, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at $20000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product, would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's try to work together on this.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13000 simply wouldn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this price represents a good value for you and a fair deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This is a serious offer and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",14000.0,Bob,6,
