"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $2,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still  above my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $1,000,000?  I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
