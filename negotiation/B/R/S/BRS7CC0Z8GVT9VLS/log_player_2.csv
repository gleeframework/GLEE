"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique item, and I believe you'll find it well worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have John as a fallback option at $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you can gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
