"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than her perceived value, you have a better alternative. You can buy the product from John for $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this more cost-effective option."
