Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. You need to balance maximizing your profit with ensuring a deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This price is just below your guaranteed amount from John, leaving you room for potential negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Confident Language:** Expressing confidence in the product's value subtly reinforces the price. 
* **No Justification:**  Avoid providing reasons for the price unless Bob asks.  Justifications can weaken your position.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You might adjust your approach based on your understanding of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
