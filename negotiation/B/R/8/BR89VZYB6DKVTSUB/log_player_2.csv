While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm on her pricing, and $825,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than John's offer and a decent deal considering the product's value to me.  There's always a risk Alice will refuse further negotiation, and I'd end up with John's less favorable offer."
