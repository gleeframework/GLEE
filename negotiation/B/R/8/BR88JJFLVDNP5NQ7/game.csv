"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $17,000. I think this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,6,
