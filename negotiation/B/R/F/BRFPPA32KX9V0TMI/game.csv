"Alice, that's a very high price.  While I appreciate you reaching out, I'm only looking to spend a maximum of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. $8000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $16500? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my maximum budget of $8000. If you're not willing to go that low, perhaps we can find a middle ground closer to that number.  Let's keep talking.",8000.0,Bob,4,
