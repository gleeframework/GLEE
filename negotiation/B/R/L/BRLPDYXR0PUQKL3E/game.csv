"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.

"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  After careful consideration, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts on this?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,925,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I value your product, $1,925,000 is still slightly beyond my budget. I can offer $1,875,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price. This offer reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
