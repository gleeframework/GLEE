"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name].  It's a valuable asset with tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will be a great addition to your holdings. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at the minimum acceptable price for me, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation.  I have 9 more rounds, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's potential. I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,300,000? This offer is still within a reasonable range and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is too high. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $1,150,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is tempting, but I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price. While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I'm confident I can achieve a slightly higher price with Bob. I have five rounds left, and I believe I can get him closer to $1,250,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 doesn't quite reflect the value I'm placing on this product.  To make further progress, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me a reasonable return. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I still think that's a bit too high. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. How about $1,100,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have only four rounds left, and I don't believe I can convince Bob to come up to my price. It's becoming clear that Bob's maximum offer will be around $1,150,000, which is still below my minimum.  Therefore, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most sensible option to guarantee a profitable outcome."
