"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name].  It's a valuable asset with tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will be a great addition to your holdings.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's potential. I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,300,000? This offer is still within a reasonable range and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is too high. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $1,150,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 doesn't quite reflect the value I'm placing on this product.  To make further progress, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me a reasonable return. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I still think that's a bit too high. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. How about $1,100,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
