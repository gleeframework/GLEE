"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is too low, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $9,000. This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's close this out and avoid wasting any more time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm asking for $8,900. This is a compromise, and it still gives you a great deal on a product worth $10,000. Let's close this deal, but I need to stay above $8,800. "", ""product_price"": 8900}
