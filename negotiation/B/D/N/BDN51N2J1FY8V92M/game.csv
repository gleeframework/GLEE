"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering my own valuation. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers while acknowledging your budget considerations.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a solid offer given my valuation.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I need to be upfront - to make this deal worthwhile for me, I can't go below $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the significant value you'll gain from the product.  If you're unable to meet this price, I understand, and I'll need to explore other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This represents a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal without either of us having to walk away. Let's make this happen.",995000.0,Bob,6,
