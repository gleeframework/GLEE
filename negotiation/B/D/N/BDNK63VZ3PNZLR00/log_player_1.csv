Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  While my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make this very appealing for you. How about a price of $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you need to aim higher with Bob to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $850,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you room to meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your $1,000,000 baseline.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:**  Mentioning a ""confidential minimum price"" creates the impression that you have a strong bottom line, potentially making Bob more willing to accept a higher price."
