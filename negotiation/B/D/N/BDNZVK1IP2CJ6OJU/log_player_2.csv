"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to both you and Alice, there's no immediate incentive to accept her offer. You're looking to save money, so rejecting and counteroffering is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer, 20% below Alice's initial price, shows you're serious about negotiating and sets a clear expectation for further rounds.  This also gives Alice room to counter without feeling like they're making a huge concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming for a lower price, so rejecting and counteroffering keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're incrementally raising your offer, showing flexibility while still pushing for a better deal.  This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Alice's latest offer, signaling a willingness to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but there's still potential for further negotiation.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation dynamic and allows you to potentially squeeze out an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're continuing to incrementally raise your offer, but at a slower pace.  This shows Alice that you're committed to finding a compromise, but you're not willing to overpay. This offer is also a compromise between your last offer and Alice's latest offer, signaling your willingness to meet halfway. You're approaching a point where accepting might be a good option, but with five rounds remaining, it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, and while the offer is tempting, you're still within striking distance of your desired price point and have four rounds remaining. By rejecting and counter-offering again, you might be able to secure a price closer to $10,750, or potentially even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous one, demonstrating that you're moving towards a compromise.  You're also keeping your offer below Alice's latest offer, signaling that you're still willing to negotiate but not willing to overpay. With three rounds left, you want to show Alice that you're serious about closing the deal, but you still have room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's getting risky to continue rejecting offers.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within your budget and only $1,000 above your last counteroffer. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price with minimal risk of further negotiation. There's a good chance that Alice would be willing to negotiate further, but the risk of not closing a deal with her and potentially being forced to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
