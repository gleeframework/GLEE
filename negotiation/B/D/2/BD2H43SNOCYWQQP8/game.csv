"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
