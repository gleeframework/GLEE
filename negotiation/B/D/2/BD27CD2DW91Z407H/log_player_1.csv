Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $150. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers. 
* **Above Value:** While the product is worth $100 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can still sell the product at her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  This initial offer is just the first step in the negotiation process.  Alice should be prepared to adjust her price based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he makes."
