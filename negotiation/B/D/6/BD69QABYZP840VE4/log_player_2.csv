Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your interest and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $675000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also shows my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to $500,000.  I'll counter again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $600000. Considering your interest and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $650000. This is the closest we've been to a deal, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's worth.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $650,000, which is significantly closer to my target of $500,000.  While I'd love to get it lower, I'm not sure how much further she'll budge.  It's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000, so I'm going to accept the offer."
