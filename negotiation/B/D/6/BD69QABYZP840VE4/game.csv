"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing the potential value of the product.  While I'm interested, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product.  This would allow me to make a worthwhile investment, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your interest and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $675000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also shows my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $675000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $600000 for the product.  This would be a good investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $600000. Considering your interest and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $650000. This is the closest we've been to a deal, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's worth.",650000.0,Alice,5,
