"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a price of $1,000,000. This is a fantastic deal, as the product is worth significantly more to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob:**  Even though Alice is selling for $1,000,000, the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This means Bob will still make a profit of $200,000."
