"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I need a price that makes sense for me too. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? I propose $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $850,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still valuing the product appropriately.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're making an effort to find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to go up to $780,000. Let me know what you think.",780000.0,Bob,6,
