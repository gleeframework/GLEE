"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the true value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I need a price that makes sense for me too. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? I propose $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move significantly from his initial offer.  While John's offer of $800,000 is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a price closer to our initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $850,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still valuing the product appropriately."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're making an effort to find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to go up to $780,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts now, indicating he may not be willing to move much higher than $780,000. It's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate a price significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John and avoid the risk of Bob not meeting our desired price point."
