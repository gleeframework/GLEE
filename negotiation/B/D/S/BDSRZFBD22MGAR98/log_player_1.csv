Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.  
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
