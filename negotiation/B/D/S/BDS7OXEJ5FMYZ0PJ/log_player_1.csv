Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing the price further if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of securing a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""unique value"" subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Showing willingness to negotiate makes Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering and keeps the communication open.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so there's less pressure to drastically reduce the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
