"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're excited about the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested if you could come down to $75.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $78, which is a fair compromise, and hopefully we can close this deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $78. However, I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you at $81. It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",81.0,Alice,5,
