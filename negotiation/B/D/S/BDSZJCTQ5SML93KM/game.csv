"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make it work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
