"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to secure a better deal.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1300000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. The product is worth more to me than $1300000, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This gives you a good price, and still allows me to earn a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
