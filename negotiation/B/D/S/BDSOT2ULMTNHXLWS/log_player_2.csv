"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's something that's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $175.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $150 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's $175."
