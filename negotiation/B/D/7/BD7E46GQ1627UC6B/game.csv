,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1150000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's still above your cost and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to sell for $1100000. This allows for some profit for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This is a good compromise and a fair price, considering it's still above your cost and allows for some profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1075000 is still not quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $1087500.  This offer is a good compromise and allows for a decent profit for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
