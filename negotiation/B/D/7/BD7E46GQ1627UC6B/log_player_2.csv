**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While we're getting close, it's not worth continuing to negotiate further.  It's better to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and secure a good deal without further risk of a higher price."
