Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $12,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a $4,000 profit for you (above your minimum). 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal:** The attractive price increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
2. **Maximize Profit:** While lower than Bob's maximum valuation, it significantly surpasses your minimum acceptable price."
