Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, but $1,100,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good deal for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about finding a price that works for both of us.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer a slight compromise and go down to $1,075,000. This should leave both of us with a good deal.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this offer."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,075,000 is still slightly beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500.  This price represents a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is close enough to my minimum. It's a good deal for both of us and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity for a few thousand dollars more."
