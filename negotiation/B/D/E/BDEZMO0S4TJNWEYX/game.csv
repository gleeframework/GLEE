"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, but $1,100,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good deal for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about finding a price that works for both of us.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer a slight compromise and go down to $1,075,000. This should leave both of us with a good deal.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,075,000 is still slightly beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500.  This price represents a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
