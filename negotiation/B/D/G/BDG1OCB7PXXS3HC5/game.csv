"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desire to sell it.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and your budget. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable addition to my collection.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer it to you for $16,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
