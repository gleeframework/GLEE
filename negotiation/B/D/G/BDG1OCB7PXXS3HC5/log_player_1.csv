Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desire to sell it.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
