"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  This offers you a significant gain and allows me to reach a fair price.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1062500. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied.",1062500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer.  Let's make a final push. I'm willing to lower my price to $1040000. This is a significant concession, and I'm truly hoping we can come to an agreement.  If we don't, I'll be forced to consider other options.",1040000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1040000 and $1000000. How about we meet at $1020000? This is my final offer.",1020000.0,Bob,8,
