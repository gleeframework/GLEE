"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than the $1,000,000 price from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value ($800,000) as possible.  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise while still being a significant discount from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than the previous offer, Bob can still try to negotiate further. Alice's offer is still closer to her value than Bob's, indicating she's willing to compromise. By rejecting this offer, Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer closer to his target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his strategy of getting closer to Alice's value.  $875,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This indicates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is now very close to Bob's target price. It is a significant discount from the original offer and is within Bob's budget. While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential gains are smaller, and there's a risk that Alice will either reject further offers or walk away from the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing the deal entirely."
