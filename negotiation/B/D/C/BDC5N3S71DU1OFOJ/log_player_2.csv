"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you and I believe you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value for the product ($1,350,000 vs. $1,200,000).**  This means there's room for negotiation.
* **John's price is your maximum limit ($1,500,000).** You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price with her. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or considering other options."
