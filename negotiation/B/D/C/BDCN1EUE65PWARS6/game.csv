"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $6,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",6500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $6,000? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",6000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from meeting your target. I can offer you the product for $6,250. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get closer to a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",6250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $6,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer you the product for $6,350. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",6350.0,Alice,7,
