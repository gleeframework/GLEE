Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $6,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer you the product for $6,350. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is signaling that she's unlikely to go much lower. While we could try to negotiate further, we risk:

* **Alice refusing to budge:**  She might stick to her $6,350 price.
* **Time running out:** We only have a few rounds left, and we might end up having to buy from John at $8,000 anyway.

Accepting the $6,350 offer secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
