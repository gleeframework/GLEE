{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and a good profit. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning that I think Bob would appreciate the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I appreciate your offer.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 110}
