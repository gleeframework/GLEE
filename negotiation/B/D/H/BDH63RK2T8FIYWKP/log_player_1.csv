Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's beneficial for you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $10,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down, there's a good chance of settling on a price higher than your $8,000 minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net at $8,000, aiming higher with Bob maximizes potential profit."
