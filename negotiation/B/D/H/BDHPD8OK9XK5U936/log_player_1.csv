"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  I've priced it at $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its value to you. Let's start the conversation! "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,000,000 gives me room to negotiate down if needed. It's a strong opening price that shows I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** I highlight the product's worth to him to emphasize the potential benefit of the deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I invite conversation, suggesting I'm willing to compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a great product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 more rounds, and I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **Seeking a better outcome:** I'm not desperate and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we compromise at $950,000? This allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a substantial price point."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but propose a compromise that's still closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on benefits for both:** I highlight the ""fair profit"" for me and the ""substantial price point"" for Bob.
* **Maintain a strong stance:** My counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but shows I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $875,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $75,000 below what I need. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** With 6 rounds remaining, I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired $950,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would secure $800,000, but continuing negotiations could lead to a significantly higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $875,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $925,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but flexible:** I reiterate that I need a higher price but remain open to negotiation. 
* **Maintain a strong position:** I've moved from $950,000 to $925,000, showing willingness to compromise but not sacrificing too much.
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:** I emphasize that reaching a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" is the goal, reminding Bob of the value he'd gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I can do $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $900,000 is just $100,000 below my desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  With only 4 rounds left, if I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away or his next offer will be lower.
* **Time is a factor:**  It's better to secure a good profit now than risk losing a deal altogether. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $900,000 is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
