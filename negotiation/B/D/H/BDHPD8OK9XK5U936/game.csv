"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  I've priced it at $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its value to you. Let's start the conversation! ",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a great product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we compromise at $950,000? This allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a substantial price point.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $875,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $875,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $925,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I can do $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.",900000.0,Bob,6,
