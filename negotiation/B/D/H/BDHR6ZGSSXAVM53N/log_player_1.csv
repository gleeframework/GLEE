Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum threshold of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 meets my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to $150 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price to $135. This is a reasonable compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $125. This is a good compromise and only $5 less than my previous offer.  Since I am confident I can't get a higher offer from Bob, I'll accept his offer."
