"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussions to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* You have a better option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd be happy to buy the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and I believe it still leaves room for a good deal for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** This counteroffer aggressively sets a lower price point, aiming to start the negotiation closer to your desired price. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob while highlighting the potential for a good deal for Alice. This helps to make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $950,000 price leaves room for Alice to counter and potentially reach a compromise within your budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate and how far she's willing to go to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value I have in mind. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget:** While Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, it's still higher than your maximum $1,000,000.
* **John offers a better deal:**  You have the option to purchase from John for $1,000,000, making Alice's offer less attractive. 
* **Continue negotiating:** It's worth rejecting Alice's offer to see if you can negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to secure a sale."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it leaves a healthy profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  You've already offered $950,000, so reiterating this price shows you're serious and willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Reminding Alice of the product's value to you reinforces that $950,000 is a fair price.
* **Profit Margin:** Highlighting the profit margin helps to make your offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Call to Action:** The message ends with a call to action, urging Alice to consider your offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value I have in mind, but it's a compromise to show my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
