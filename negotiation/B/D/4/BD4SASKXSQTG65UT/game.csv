"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm always happy to find a compromise.  However, $1600000 doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1650000, meeting you halfway on your suggested range. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
