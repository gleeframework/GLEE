"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit too far off. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $115. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",115.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $120, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. How about we meet at $119? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",119.0,Alice,7,
