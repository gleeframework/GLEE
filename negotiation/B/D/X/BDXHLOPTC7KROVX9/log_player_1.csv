Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal, it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in my product and come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It would be pointless to continue negotiating for a higher price, as there's no guarantee I'll get it. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer makes sense. It avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures a quick and profitable sale."
