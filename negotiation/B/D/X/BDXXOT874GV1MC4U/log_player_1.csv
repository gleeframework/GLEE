{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it'll be equally valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum threshold. Accepting his offer secures the sale and guarantees me my desired earnings."
