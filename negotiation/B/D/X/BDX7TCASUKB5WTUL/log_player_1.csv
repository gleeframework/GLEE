Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. It's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal for me considering the value of the product to Bob.  I also want to avoid risking a stalemate or having to sell to John for a lower price."
