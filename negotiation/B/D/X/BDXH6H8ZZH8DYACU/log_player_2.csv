Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that you'll love the product at this price.

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  Continuing to negotiate might irritate her and it's not worth risking the deal for a few more dollars.  $108 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer."
