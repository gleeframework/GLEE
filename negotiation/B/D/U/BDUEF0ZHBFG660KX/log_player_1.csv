"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it sets a strong baseline and gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in subsequent rounds. I'll also be monitoring the situation closely and ready to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to sell the product,  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and counter in the next round.  I will aim for a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $17,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  However, it's still above my minimum price, and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to reach a deal while ensuring I still get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum,  $13,000 is still below my desired price. I'm not willing to accept that, especially considering we're already nearing the halfway point of the negotiations. I will counter with a higher offer, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm making a small concession, dropping to $16,000.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating my flexibility while still being within a range I'm comfortable with.  We're getting close to the halfway point, and I want to gauge Bob's interest at this price. If he rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John, as we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. It's less than $1,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I will counter with a slightly higher offer, hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us before we run out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $14,500. This is a very small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows my willingness to compromise. With only three rounds remaining, it's time to make a decision. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000 as we are approaching the deadline."
