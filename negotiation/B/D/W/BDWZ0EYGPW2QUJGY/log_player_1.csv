Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know how valuable it would be to you, so I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice will sell for no less than $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a fallback option at $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

Alice aims to maximize her profit by offering the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, allowing Alice to secure a significant profit beyond her minimum acceptable price."
