"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? It's a significant investment on my end, but I believe it's a fair reflection of its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $825,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this compromise is fair and reflects the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?  I'm eager to make this deal work and believe this price is a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm eager to finalize the deal, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
