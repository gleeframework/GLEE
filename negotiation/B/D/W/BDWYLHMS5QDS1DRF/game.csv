"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $170 for it.  What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $170 is a bit too steep for me though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate that.  $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's split the difference and go with $105. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $105 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. My best offer is $95.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to check out some other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
