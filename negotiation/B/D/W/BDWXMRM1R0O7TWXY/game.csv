"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $1200000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1400000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1600000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1580000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can understand that this is a fair price considering the product's value.
