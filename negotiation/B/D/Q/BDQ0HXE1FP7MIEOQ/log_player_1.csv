# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
