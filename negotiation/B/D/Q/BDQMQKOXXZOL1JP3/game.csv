"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a great price for you considering its value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is valuable to you, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for $12,000? I think this would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's much closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $15,000 might not be ideal for you, but given my budget constraints, I believe we can find a solution. How about we aim for $13,000? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm open to finding a compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $14,000? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to receive.  Let's make this deal happen.",14000.0,Alice,5,
