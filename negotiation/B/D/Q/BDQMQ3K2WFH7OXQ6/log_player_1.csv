Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description - be specific and enticing] that I believe will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This allows for room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Product Description:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. Being specific and enticing is crucial for generating interest. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question like ""Let me know what you think!"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

This is just the initial offer.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response and aim to maximize my profit while keeping in mind the potential of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, based on my current budget and assessment of the product's worth to me, I am willing to pay no more than $15000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in subsequent rounds, and the risk of continued negotiation could lead to no sale at all.  

While I'd prefer a higher price, securing a sale at my minimum value is a sound decision.  I can always explore other opportunities to sell similar products in the future."
