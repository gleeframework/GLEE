Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $900,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get closer to my ideal price point."
