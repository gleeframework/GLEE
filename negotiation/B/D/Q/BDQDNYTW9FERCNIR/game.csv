"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth considering a price of $950,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $875,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  This would allow us to close the deal and save both of us time.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering $920,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
