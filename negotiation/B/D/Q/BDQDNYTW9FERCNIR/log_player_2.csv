"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth considering a price of $950,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $950,000 is still above his budget and he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a better offer than Alice's first, it's still above Bob's desired budget. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $875,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  This would allow us to close the deal and save both of us time."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering $920,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price within his budget. He's already gone back and forth multiple times and Alice's final offer of $920,000 is still too high.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $800,000."
