"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice. You're still within your budget and there's a chance you could bring the price down closer to your $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $12,500, but it's still within my budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate.  This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is within my budget and is only $1,000 more than what I can get it from John.  While further negotiation is possible, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to bring the price down further, and it's likely that Alice will make another counteroffer that's closer to $11,000.  It's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with rather than risk further negotiations that might lead to a higher price."
