"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $1,300,000. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
