"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** A $1,150,000 offer gives Bob a decent amount of room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. This encourages him to engage rather than immediately rejecting. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is about gauging Bob's interest and seeing how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Bob's offer is already above my minimum price and it's a good starting point for the negotiation.
* **Risk of Going Lower:**  While I could counteroffer and try to get more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or offer a lower price in subsequent rounds.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting now allows me to secure a good price quickly and avoids the potential for further negotiation delays."
