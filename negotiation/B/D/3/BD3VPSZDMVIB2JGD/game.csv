"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11,500? This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final compromise, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. If you're willing to come down to $10,500, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
