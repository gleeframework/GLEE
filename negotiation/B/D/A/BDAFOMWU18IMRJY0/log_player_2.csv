"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering its value and the fact I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
