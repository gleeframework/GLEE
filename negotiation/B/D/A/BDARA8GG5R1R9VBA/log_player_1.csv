Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price leaves room for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **If Negotiation Stalls:** I can always go with John's offer to ensure a sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a bit steep at $1,250,000, but I'm still very interested in making a deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum and exploring the possibility of a compromise.
* **Monitoring the Situation:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer and the potential for a successful deal. If the negotiation stalls, I'm prepared to move forward with John's offer to secure my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? This would be a fair compromise, and it still gives you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to reach a deal.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" might make Bob more receptive.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll secure a good deal. 
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to make another counteroffer or consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,120,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob is showing interest and commitment, his offer of $1,120,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation with Bob might be time-consuming and could lead to a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum price, ensuring a substantial profit and minimizing the risk of a lower price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:** I will reach out to John and finalize the sale at $1,500,000. 

This decision prioritizes maximizing profit and minimizing risk. While a deal with Bob is possible, the potential for a lower price and the time investment required for continued negotiation make John's offer the more attractive option."
