Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional and worth a premium.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. $880,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's try $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?
