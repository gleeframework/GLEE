"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $850,000? I think that's a fair price that still gives you a good return.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional and worth a premium. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This price still allows you to make a substantial profit while getting you a fantastic product. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $925,000 is closer, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $880,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. $880,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's try $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about we settle on $890,000?  That's a firm offer from my side.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. However, I'm confident this product is worth a little more.  Let's meet at $895,000.  It's a small increase from your last offer, but it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",895000.0,Alice,7,
