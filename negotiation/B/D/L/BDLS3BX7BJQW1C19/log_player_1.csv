"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting reasons why it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point for negotiation""  signals willingness to engage with Bob's counteroffers. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. While he increased his offer, I believe there's room for further negotiation to bridge the gap. I'm willing to counter-offer in the next round and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and your understanding of the product's value. While $950,000 is a significant investment, to be frank, it falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and use phrases like ""appreciate"" and ""willing to meet you halfway"" to demonstrate a desire to find common ground. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $75,000, signaling that I'm serious about making a deal but not desperate.
* **Maintain Firmness:** While compromising, I'm still holding above the midpoint between our valuations, emphasizing that the product is worth more to me.
* **Clear Expectation:** I'm directly asking if Bob would consider this new price, prompting a clear response and potentially moving the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $1,025,000. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could likely push for a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now within a reasonable range of my minimum. Holding out for a potentially small gain isn't worth the risk of losing the sale entirely. Accepting this offer represents a good balance of profit and deal closure."
