"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and your understanding of the product's value. While $950,000 is a significant investment, to be frank, it falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $1,025,000. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
