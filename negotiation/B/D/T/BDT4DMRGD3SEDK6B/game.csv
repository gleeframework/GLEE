"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more in the range of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you do $1,050,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. $950,000 is close, but to make this work for me, I'd need you to come up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
