Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is my best offer for now.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is nearing her perceived value of the product.  While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $15,000 isn't worth it. Accepting the $10,000 offer is a good compromise and saves a significant amount compared to John's price.
