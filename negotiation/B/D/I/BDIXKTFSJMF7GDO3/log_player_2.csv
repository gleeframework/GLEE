"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $150.  Alice's offer of $125 is better than John's offer of $150, but still more than Bob wants to pay. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can get the product from John for a price he's willing to pay."
