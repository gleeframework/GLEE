I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation but is still significantly above my minimum value."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise that's still higher than Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell for that price. I'll try to push for a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a little more, $129 is a good deal considering I have fewer rounds left and John is offering $120."
