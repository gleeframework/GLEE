Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce to Bob that it's worth a significant amount, even if you don't explicitly state its worth to you.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you will list it publicly, you subtly imply that Bob might lose the opportunity to buy it if he declines, potentially pushing him to act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you start at $15,000, the phrasing leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. 

Remember: This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong fallback option with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
