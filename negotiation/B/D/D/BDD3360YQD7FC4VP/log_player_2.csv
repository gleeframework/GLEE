# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can do better than $1,150,000, so rejecting the offer is the best move for Bob.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes the inherent value of the product while still offering you a significant gain.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,100,000 is a better price than $1,150,000, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
