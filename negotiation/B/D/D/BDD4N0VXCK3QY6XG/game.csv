,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $110.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about the product, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. How about we meet at $130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
