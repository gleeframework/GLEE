"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I will choose option 2: Reject Alice's offer. 

My goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay ($80 is the value I place on the product). I will look for a better deal.
