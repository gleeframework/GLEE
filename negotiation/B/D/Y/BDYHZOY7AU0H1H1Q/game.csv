"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. I'm asking for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for less than it's worth to you, and I'll be able to make a good profit. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
