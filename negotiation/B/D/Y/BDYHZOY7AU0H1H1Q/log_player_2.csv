"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. I'm asking for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for less than it's worth to you, and I'll be able to make a good profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your goal is to save money.** 
* Alice's offer is better than John's, but still higher than the product's value to you.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps your options open.** You can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John as a last resort."
