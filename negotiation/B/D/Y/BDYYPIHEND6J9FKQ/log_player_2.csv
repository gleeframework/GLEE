"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$120 is too high for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $150 and the product's value to him is only $80. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob offers $90 as a counteroffer. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for bargaining, as it's closer to Alice's value of $80 than to Bob's maximum budget of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob wants to save as much as possible and sees room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly to $95. This demonstrates that he's willing to compromise, but still pushing for a lower price. It's a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer of $90 and Alice's last offer of $110. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and increases the chances of a successful deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is now within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise.  He's saved $45 from John's price and has gotten closer to his desired price. Accepting at this point maximizes his savings and ensures he gets the product."
