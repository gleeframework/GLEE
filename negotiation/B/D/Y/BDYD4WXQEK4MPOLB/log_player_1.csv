Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $970,000. I believe this is the maximum I can pay and still make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal, but Bob is clearly willing to go higher.  We've set a firm tone with the ""final offer"" in the last round, but we're not ready to walk away yet.  Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about the value while still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a way to close this deal.  If you're willing to meet me at $975,000, we have an agreement. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the deal:** By offering a small concession and presenting it as a final opportunity, we increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Maximize profit:**  We're still holding firm above Bob's last offer, aiming for the highest possible price.
* **Convey seriousness:** The tone suggests this is our final compromise, adding weight to the offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $965,000, which is the maximum I can pay and still make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer at this stage. He's consistently stuck in a lower range, and we've already made significant concessions. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a substantial amount compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed profit."
