"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, above my minimum value but not too high to scare Bob away. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept and sell for $100, I'd prefer to try and negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but still keeps me above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is close to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering with $125. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping this signals my willingness to compromise while also staying above my minimum value. I'm getting close to my minimum value and don't want to risk losing Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value but it is still too low. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk further negotiation. I'm going to sell to John for $120 to secure a guaranteed sale."
