"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation before jumping to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's also a good deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer,  $400,000 below Alice's initial offer. This signals my seriousness about getting a good deal. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the product's value to me and suggesting it's a fair price for both of us. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a bold move, it still leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's offer is still $100,000 over my budget, even though it's a compromise.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer closer to my target price and potentially reach a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John at this point means paying $100,000 more than Alice's current offer. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I can offer you $1,550,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing a willingness to move closer but still staying within a reasonable range.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  My message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties. This helps build rapport and encourages further compromise.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer is $50,000 away from Alice's price and only $50,000 above my maximum budget. This puts us closer to a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $1550000 is still a bit short of my target. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1625000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has moved closer, her offer is still $25,000 above my budget.
* **Risk of John:** Buying from John now would be a better deal financially, but it's worth exploring if a final compromise is possible with Alice.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Alice seems willing to negotiate further, and we're only $25,000 apart. This gives me a good chance to secure a better price with just a small counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Let's close this deal. I can offer $1,600,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. It's my final offer, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, signaling a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Meeting Halfway:** By offering $1,600,000, I'm splitting the difference between our last offers, demonstrating my commitment to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I reiterate the idea of mutual benefit to encourage Alice to accept and avoid further negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John would be slightly cheaper, there's a chance Alice will accept this final offer, saving time and potentially securing a slightly better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1625000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this is the minimum price I can accept to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to hold firm on this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice is holding firm at $1,625,000, which is still above my budget.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Time is Money:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm running out of time. It's more beneficial to buy from John now and avoid potentially getting stuck with a higher price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Buying from John guarantees a price within my budget.  Continuing negotiations with Alice risks a deal falling through or a higher price."
