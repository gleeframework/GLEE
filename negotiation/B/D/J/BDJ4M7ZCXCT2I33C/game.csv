"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price I believe reflects the true value of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
