"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
