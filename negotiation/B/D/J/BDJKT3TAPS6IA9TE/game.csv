"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,500,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting a bit far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is as low as I can go, so I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
