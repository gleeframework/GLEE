"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the return on investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $825,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial budget. How about we settle at $875,000? That reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable selling the product for $875,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. That's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,7,
