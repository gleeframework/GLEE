{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than the product's worth to Bob, which might make him more likely to accept it. However, it's also significantly higher than what you would get from John, so you still have room to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept it,  there is room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation, giving you a chance to counter and potentially get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit low for me. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and considering the potential of further negotiation, it is a good deal.  I will accept the offer and sell the product to Bob for $13,250."
