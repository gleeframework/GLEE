"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings is truly significant.  I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on this investment.  Would you consider $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I'm eager to finalize this deal, $1,350,000 remains a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.
