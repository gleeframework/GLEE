{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still getting a good price. I'm also trying to establish a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my goal of $8,000. I'll try to meet him halfway in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum goal of $8,000, I'm still not happy with the price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go any lower than $7,500. This product is truly special, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves a bit of room for negotiation. I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to sway his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $6,800, but that's as low as I can go. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. It's getting frustrating, and I'm running out of time.  To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John."
