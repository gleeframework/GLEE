"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $7500?  I believe that's a fair price that would allow us to make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8250? That would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8250.0,Bob,4,
