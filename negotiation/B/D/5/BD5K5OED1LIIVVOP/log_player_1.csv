Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $7500?  I believe that's a fair price that would allow us to make a deal.
