"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?  It's still a fair price for you and it's within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really benefit from it. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go for $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me get the product without breaking the bank.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $127. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",127.0,Alice,5,
