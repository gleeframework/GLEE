"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is too high, and Bob can potentially get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, knowing that Alice's minimum selling price is $12,000.  This establishes a starting point for negotiation and signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still not the best deal possible.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's likely minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal.  The goal is to find a price that both parties can agree on, and this offer might be the sweet spot."
