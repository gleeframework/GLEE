"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
