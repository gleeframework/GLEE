"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I think a starting price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is significantly below its market value.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to let it go for $9,750.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,750 is still a bit high for me.  Could we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. $7,500 is still quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I am serious about the product, but $9,000 is still pushing my budget. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $8,250. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",8250.0,Bob,6,
