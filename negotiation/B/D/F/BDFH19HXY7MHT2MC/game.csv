"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is my best offer for now, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $16,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit higher than your price. I'm willing to pay cash upfront and waive any additional fees, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. If we can agree on this, I'm willing to finalize the deal today.",14000.0,Bob,6,
