Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired value."

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,500. This is a compromise between my desired value and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement in this round."

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."

I'm going to stick with my minimum value.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  It's a bit of a gamble, but I hope Bob will accept and we can close the deal."
