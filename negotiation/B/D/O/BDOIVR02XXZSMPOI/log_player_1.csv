While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob has been firm at $1,200,000 and it's becoming clear that this is his ceiling. Accepting his offer now ensures we close the deal and avoid the risk of him walking away. It's always good to leave a little ""meat on the bone"" in a negotiation to maintain goodwill."
