"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to you as well. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000, which I think is fair considering its potential value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering its value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still confident that this product holds significant value for you.  Given that, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,125,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a very attractive opportunity for you. Let's keep the negotiation moving.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. Can you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,100,000 still doesn't fully reflect the value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to go down to $1,112,500.  This is a final concession from my side, and it's a price that would still be a very advantageous deal for you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
