"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm afraid $800000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $990000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",990000.0,Alice,7,
