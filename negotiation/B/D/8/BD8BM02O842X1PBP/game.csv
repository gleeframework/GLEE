"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for us both to benefit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's a bit more reasonable considering your budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
