Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's a bit more reasonable considering your budget. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He is still closer to his target price than Alice is to hers."

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay less, this is a good deal for him.  He's only $20,000 over his target price, and it's likely Alice won't budge any further.  If he rejects this offer, he risks Alice walking away and him having to buy from John for a higher price."
