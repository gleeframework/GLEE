"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business.

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering your asking price is significantly higher than your product's true value, I'd be happy to pay $13,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,800. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13800.0,Alice,3,
