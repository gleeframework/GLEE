"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($12,000) and only $1,000 below Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering your asking price is significantly higher than your product's true value, I'd be happy to pay $13,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,800. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,800 is a good compromise. It's still below Bob's maximum of $15,000 and closer to the product's value to Alice ($12,000).  Accepting this offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
