Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit lower than what I need. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,375? This way, we both get closer to our desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10375}
