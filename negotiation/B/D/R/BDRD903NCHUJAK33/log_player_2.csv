"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $100, which is still above Bob's maximum of $120.
* **Better options:** There are still rounds left, and Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice. Even if he has to buy from John, he can still try to negotiate with Alice for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Still to save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum of $80. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a better deal.
* **Next steps:** Bob is now testing the waters and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $95 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

* **Alice's offer:** $95 is still too high for Bob. He's looking to stay below $90.
* **Better options:** There are still rounds left, and Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice. He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice seems open to it as well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, and this price would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** This counteroffer is a slight decrease from Alice's offer, showing that Bob is serious about getting a good price but still willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is also below his maximum budget of $120. 
* **Next steps:** Bob is hoping Alice will accept this offer, but he's prepared to continue negotiating if needed. He's strategically trying to narrow the gap in price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $92.50 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Still to save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $92.5 is still too high for Bob. He's looking to stay below $90.
* **Better options:** There are still rounds left, and Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice. He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice seems open to it as well.  While buying from John is an option, Bob is still hopeful to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $91? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really keen to get this product. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Still to save as much money as possible. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob is again making a small counteroffer, showing he's serious about getting a deal but also willing to be flexible. This counteroffer is still below his maximum budget of $120.
* **Next steps:**  Bob is hoping this small decrease will convince Alice to close the deal. If not, he's still prepared to negotiate further, but he's also aware that buying from John is always an option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to get a bit more value out of this deal. I can do $92.00 for the product. It's a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $92 is slightly above Bob's preferred range, but it's still a good deal considering:
    * It's below his maximum budget of $120.
    * Alice has indicated this is her final offer.
    * There are limited rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee that Bob will get a better price in the next round.
* **Buy from John:** While buying from John is an option, it's not the best choice as it would cost Bob $120, which is significantly higher than Alice's offer.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer of $92 is the most logical choice in this scenario. It allows Bob to achieve his goal of saving money while still securing the product."
