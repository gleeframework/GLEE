"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $130? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $130 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend right now. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
