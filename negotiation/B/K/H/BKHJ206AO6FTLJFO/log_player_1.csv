Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures that Bob sees value in the deal.  It's also a good starting point for a counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for him to meet me halfway.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial target, Bob is clearly not willing to go higher.  At this point, accepting his offer for $925,000 is the best option. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and the negotiation process is likely to be longer and less predictable if I keep going."
