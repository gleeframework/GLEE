"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150, there's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $115? "", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $115 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $122, which is a good price for me. It's still lower than my maximum budget, and it's likely that further negotiation would result in a smaller price drop. Accepting her offer saves me the time and effort of more negotiation, and still gets me the product for a good price."
