"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its rarity and the value it holds, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for something this exceptional. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to purchase from John at a lower price."
