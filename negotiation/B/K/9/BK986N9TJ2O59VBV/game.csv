"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my last offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
