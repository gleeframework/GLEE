You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, but I also want to avoid being too aggressive and potentially ending the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I still have room to negotiate.  There's no reason to settle yet, as I can potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I want to see if we can find a middle ground.  $8,500 is a good compromise that might be appealing to both of us."
