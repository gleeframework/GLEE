"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $160 is way above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is quite low for what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $80. This is the absolute most I can pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly set on his valuation of $80 and is unlikely to budge. It's not worth continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $120 from John."
