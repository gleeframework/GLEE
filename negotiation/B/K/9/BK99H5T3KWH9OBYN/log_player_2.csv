Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $900,000 is simply too low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
