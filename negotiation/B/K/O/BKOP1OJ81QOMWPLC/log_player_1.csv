Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you!  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a great deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potential counteroffers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. $12,000 is still below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the incredible value this product has to offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13000.  I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is above my minimum and represents a good compromise. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
