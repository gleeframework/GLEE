"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you!  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potential counteroffers. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  This shows you're serious about buying the product but also that you have a budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This reflects the incredible value this product has to offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in the middle ground between Alice's offer and your initial counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a quick deal."
