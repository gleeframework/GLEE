"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This reflects the incredible value this product has to offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13000.  I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
