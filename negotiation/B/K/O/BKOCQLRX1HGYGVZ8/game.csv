"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering it's only worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I'm already making a concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is as close to $14,000 as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12,000. It's a fair deal for both of us considering your value of $15,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $12,000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to $13,500. This is as close to my minimum price of $15,000 as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
