"I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too much for me. How about $120? That's closer to what I'm able to pay, and it gives you a good profit as well.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $120 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm happy to go a little higher, but $140 is still too much for me. How about $130? That's a fair price for both of us. ",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,7,
