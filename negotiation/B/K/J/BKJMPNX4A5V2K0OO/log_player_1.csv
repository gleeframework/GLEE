"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000}

While $1,200,000 is a lot closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm still holding out for more.  I have 8 rounds left to potentially get a better price from Bob or, in the worst case,  sell to John for my minimum acceptable amount."
