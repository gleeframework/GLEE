"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $950000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the value you've indicated the product holds for you, and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.  I'm willing to go down to $1020000 for the product. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's fair considering the value you see in it. Let's find common ground.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be closer to my minimum price to make this work.  Let's split the difference and go with $1005000. This is a fair price considering the value you've indicated for the product and my need to cover my costs. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial agreement.",1005000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, but I'd rather go even lower. How about $985000?",985000.0,Bob,8,
