"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring whether Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,500 is a good starting point, as it's a considerable drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to profit slightly. This initial counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $11,500 is still a bit too high for Bob. He's aiming for a price closer to $10,500.  He's already rejected an offer of $11,000, so there's no reason to accept a higher one. There are still rounds to go, and Bob wants to keep negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing that he's willing to compromise.  $10,750 is a small step up from his previous offer but still keeps him below his $12,000 limit. This is a calculated move to see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still too high.  Bob is determined to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal. He's already rejected an offer of $11,500, so accepting $11,750 would be a step backward.  There are still several rounds left to negotiate, and Bob wants to see if he can secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer, but still below his $12,000 limit.  Offering $11,000 is a compromise, and demonstrates that Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway. This counter-offer is a calculated risk; it's possible Alice will reject it, but Bob believes it's a reasonable offer, and he's confident he can still save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $11,800 is only $200 away from Bob's maximum price. However, with only three rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a decision. While he could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will not budge, leaving him with no choice but to accept her offer and pay a price closer to his limit.

Given the limited rounds and the potential for further negotiation to fail,  Bob is better off buying the product from John for $12,000. This guarantees him the product at a known price, within his budget, and avoids the risk of further haggling."
