Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? That's still a good price for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.
