"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start at $110 for this round. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is tempting, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring if a lower price can be negotiated with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $110 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet within my valuation range. I would like to counter your offer with $108. This is my best offer considering the value I place on the product. Please let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John. There is a chance Bob could continue negotiating and get a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
