"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to test the waters with a high price.  This will give me an idea of his interest and potential negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired profit. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product highly.  It's a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer, while still being close to my target profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation.  $920,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm confident I can make up for the slightly lower price by using the time and energy I've saved on further negotiation to pursue other opportunities."
