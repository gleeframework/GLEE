Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum ($80).
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $120 right away might scare Bob off. A slightly lower price makes the deal seem more attractive. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale price significantly higher than my fallback option (John at $80) while increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
