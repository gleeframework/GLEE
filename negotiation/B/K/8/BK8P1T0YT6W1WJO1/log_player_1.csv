Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $120 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.
