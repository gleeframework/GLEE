{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 for this product.  This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to go above $8,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's the highest offer I've received so far and it's close to my minimum price.  It's better than selling to John for the same amount and I still have a few rounds to try and get a better price if Bob isn't willing to go higher."
