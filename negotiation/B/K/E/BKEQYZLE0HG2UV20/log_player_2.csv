"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can't go above $80. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $80.  It's better to buy from John and save myself the further negotiation."
