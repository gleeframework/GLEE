"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,300,000? I believe that represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we do $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
