Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $100 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This product is truly unique and worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $85. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation and the risk of losing the sale to John."
