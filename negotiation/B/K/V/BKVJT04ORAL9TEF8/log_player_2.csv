"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll make a great decision. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value to Bob. 
* While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum price, it's significantly more than Alice's own valuation.
* There's a good chance Bob can negotiate a better price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere. 

By rejecting this offer, Bob opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or can proceed to purchase from John at a price closer to his maximum budget."
