"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential for future collaboration. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $950,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  $1,020,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to go to $980,000.  This is a fair compromise considering our earlier discussions and the fact that I have another offer for $1,200,000. I believe we can reach a deal at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
