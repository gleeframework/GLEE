"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but I can likely get a better price.  I'll reject and counter-offer, hoping to save some more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the generous offer, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price considering my initial target was to save as much money as possible.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my offer again and potentially driving the price higher is not worth it. Accepting her offer secures the product at a decent price and avoids the potential of losing it to another buyer."
