"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the generous offer, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
