Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you significant leverage in negotiations.
* **Targeting the Maximum:** Starting with a strong offer of $1,250,000 aims to capture a substantial portion of the value difference ($750,000) between your minimum and Bob's maximum. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the offer as time-sensitive and exclusive adds pressure and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have a way to communicate the offer's limited timeframe to Bob convincingly.
*  There's a risk Bob might reject this initial offer, pushing you to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price with Bob makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
