"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is closer to what I can afford and a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for it. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
