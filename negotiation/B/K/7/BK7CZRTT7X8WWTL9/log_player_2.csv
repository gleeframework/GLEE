"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000** - This is more than Alice's value of $1,200,000 but less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is $1,500,000** - This is your maximum budget. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** 

Since rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John at your maximum budget, it's the best choice to maximize savings."
