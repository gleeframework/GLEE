Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $950,000?**  This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows for potential concessions while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Why not go higher?**  A much higher price risks immediate rejection from Bob, making it harder to reach a deal. 
* **Why not go lower?** A lower price might seem enticing to Bob, but it also diminishes Alice's potential profit significantly.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! Alice sells the product and makes a good profit. 
* If Bob rejects, Alice will evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with another offer.  
* Alice will always keep the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 in mind if negotiations with Bob stall or don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why Reject?** While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than Alice's desired minimum of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would leave Alice with a considerable loss compared to selling to John.
* **Why not sell to John?**  Alice has room for negotiation with Bob. A slightly lower offer from Bob might be acceptable, but it's too early to give up on the negotiation.
* **What's next?** Alice will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to her desired range.  She wants to maximize her profit without risking a complete breakdown in the negotiation.

**Possible Counteroffers:**

Alice might offer a price between $900,000 and $950,000. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting her bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $925,000?** This price is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves Alice with a reasonable profit. It's a middle ground that shows Alice's willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Why not go higher?**  Alice needs to show Bob she is serious about making a deal and is willing to move closer to his offer. A higher counteroffer risks further stalling the negotiation or pushing Bob away entirely.
* **Why not go lower?**  Alice's minimum acceptable price is likely higher than $900,000. This counteroffer offers a better profit margin for Alice while still keeping the negotiation open. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, Alice has achieved a successful negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects, Alice will need to carefully assess whether to accept his next counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or ultimately sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why Reject?**  While Bob's offer is closer to Alice's desired price, it's still below her minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Selling to Bob at this price would mean a considerable loss for Alice compared to selling to John.
* **Why not sell to John?**  Alice is close to reaching a deal with Bob. While John represents a guaranteed $1,000,000, Alice wants to explore further negotiation with Bob to potentially secure a better deal.
* **What's next?** Alice will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to her desired range.  She wants to maximize her profit without risking a complete breakdown in the negotiation.

**Possible Counteroffers:**

Alice could offer a price between $900,000 and $925,000. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting her bottom line.  Alice needs to balance pushing for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $900,000?** This is a significant concession from Alice's previous offer of $925,000, but it still leaves her with a profit margin. It shows Bob that she's willing to negotiate and come closer to his price. 
* **Why not go higher?**  Alice is trying to find a balance between maximizing her profit and making a deal. Going higher might risk losing Bob completely.
* **Why not go lower?** This price is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and it keeps the negotiation moving.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, Alice has secured a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects,  Alice needs to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or finally sell the product to John. This decision will depend on how much profit she's willing to sacrifice and the likelihood of reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why sell to John?** The negotiation with Bob has reached a stalemate. Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below Alice's desired price and her minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Why not accept Bob's offer?** Alice would be losing a considerable amount of money by accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Why not counteroffer Bob again?**  Alice has already made several concessions. Further counteroffers might be perceived as stubborn or unwilling to compromise, leading to a complete breakdown in negotiations. 

**The Decision:**

Selling to John guarantees Alice her desired minimum price of $1,000,000.  While Alice would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, John represents a reliable buyer who ensures a secure profit and avoids further potential loss from continued negotiation with Bob."
