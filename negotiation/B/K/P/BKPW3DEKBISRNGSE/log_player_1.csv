Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. I'm also being friendly and engaging to make the negotiation process smoother."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal for you, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not willing to go up to $135. How about $132? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still less than my initial desired price, it's a reasonable compromise. I'm getting closer to my minimum and Bob seems determined at this point.  Accepting his offer is the best option to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
