"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",170.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  While $125 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $100. Would you consider $95? That's a firm offer on my end.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the price under $100, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
