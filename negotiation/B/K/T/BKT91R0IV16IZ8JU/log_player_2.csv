"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm aiming to get it for a bit less.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $9,250?  It's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming for a lower price.  While $9,250 is better than $9,500, you're only $250 away from your ideal price of $9,000.  There's still room for Alice to compromise, and rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're serious about making a deal but still want to save money. $9,125 is a small step towards Alice's offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still getting a good price."
