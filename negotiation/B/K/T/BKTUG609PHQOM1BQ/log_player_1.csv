Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to maximize my profits while still keeping the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $16,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will hopefully lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer more, accepting $14,000 is a better outcome than selling to John for $15,000.  It's unlikely Bob will offer more, so I'm going to accept this offer."
