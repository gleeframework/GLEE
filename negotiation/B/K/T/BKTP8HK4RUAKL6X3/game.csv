"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm not comfortable paying that price. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for it. This is my best offer, and it's still a significant amount of money. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial valuation. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
