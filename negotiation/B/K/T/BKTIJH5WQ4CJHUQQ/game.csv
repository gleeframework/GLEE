"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a little high for my budget. Could you do $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle on $16,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way to make this work for us. My absolute lowest price is $14,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a very fair compromise. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I can do $13,500. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with a different option.",13500.0,Bob,8,
