Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  I can do $13,500. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with a different option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Bob is unlikely to go above his last offer, and it's clear we've reached his upper limit. It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $15,000 from John for a slightly higher potential gain from Bob."
