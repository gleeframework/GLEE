"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. Bob has shown a strong interest in the product, and by rejecting his offer, I can leverage his interest to potentially negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $8,500. This is my best offer based on my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my desired range. I'm confident I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can influence Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500, but that's still a little too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I think $9,500 is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I would like to counter with $9,000. This is my maximum budget for this product. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price of $9,500.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and close to my target."
