Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $112. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $110, and even then, it's a gamble. You've done well negotiating, but it's better to secure a guaranteed price of $150 from John than risk ending up with nothing and potentially having to pay more later."
