"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its actual value to me.  How about we start at something more reasonable?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but we're still quite far apart. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers? ",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit rich for me. I'm willing to meet you at a compromise that makes sense for both of us. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
