Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $990,000. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and this offer reflects a unique opportunity to acquire it."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $990,000 aims to:
    * Be significantly appealing to Bob, as it's well below his perceived value of $800,000.
    * Leave room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer as a special opportunity, encouraging Bob to accept.

This approach prioritizes maximizing potential earnings from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
