Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's aiming to save as much money as possible, and $13,000 is more than his maximum budget.  He'll counter-offer in the next round."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $12,500. He'll counter-offer in the next round."
