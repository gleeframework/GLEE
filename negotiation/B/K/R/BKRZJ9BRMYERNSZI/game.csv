"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in making this investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I believe will benefit both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it's a good step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is a compromise that I believe will work for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
