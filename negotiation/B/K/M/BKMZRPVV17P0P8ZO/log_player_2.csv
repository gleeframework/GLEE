"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While it's not the absolute best price, it saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** Even though Bob could potentially get a lower price by negotiating with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
