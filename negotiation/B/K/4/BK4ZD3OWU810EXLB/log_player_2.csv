"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, it's still higher than both Alice's valuation and my maximum. There's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her valuation.  This strategy allows me to gauge her flexibility and willingness to negotiate. If she's firm on a price closer to $14,000, I can always increase my offer in subsequent rounds, knowing I have John's offer of $15,000 as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  However, $11,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway – how about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice meeting me halfway suggests she's willing to negotiate. While $12,500 is closer to her valuation, it's still above what I'd ideally want to pay. I'll make another counteroffer, pushing slightly lower, to see if there's any more wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming directly for Alice's valuation with this counteroffer.  This is a strong negotiating tactic – it's the highest price I'm willing to pay while still offering Alice a profit.  If she rejects this, I'm content to walk away and buy from John at $15,000."
