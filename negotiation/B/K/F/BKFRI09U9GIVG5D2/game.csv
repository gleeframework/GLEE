"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  While I'm interested in the product, I can't go above $9,000. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount from my original price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering your value and my maximum budget. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a stretch for you, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
