# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its high quality and unique features, I estimate its value to be well above $8000. I am extending this opportunity to you with an exclusive offer of $12000. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the potential long-term benefits it could bring to you. I look forward to discussing how this product can meet your specific needs and contribute to your success. Please let me know if you have any questions or require additional information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  Since you can buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to buying from Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your limit, while there's no potential for a better price from Alice."
