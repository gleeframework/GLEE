Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a good negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I think the product's value to you is clear, and I'm confident we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems to be stuck at a price point that doesn't benefit me. She's unwilling to budge below $1,050,000, and it's clear she won't accept my $1,000,000 offer. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Buying from John for $1,200,000, while not ideal, saves me the hassle of further negotiation and guarantees I get the product."
