"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is less than the $100 John is asking, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob knows the product is worth $80 to Alice, so he starts by offering a price slightly above that. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $85 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone to encourage a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $87.50 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his $100 threshold and leaves some profit for Alice.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower.  There's a risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 10 rounds, it's crucial to strike a deal sooner rather than later. Accepting the offer secures the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation delays."
