Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $8,500.  This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his perceived value.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better deal.  I'm happy to accept and move on."
