Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
