# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, but I'm still not willing to go below $500,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $495,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $495,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $495,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly signaling this is her best offer, and while getting to $475,000 would be ideal, $495,000 is a good price and significantly below John's offer.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
