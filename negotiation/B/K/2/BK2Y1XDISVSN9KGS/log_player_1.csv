Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $700000 for it, reflecting the potential value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
