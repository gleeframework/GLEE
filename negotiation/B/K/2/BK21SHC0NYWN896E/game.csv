"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1700000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1900000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's true value, and I'm not sure I want to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for this exceptional product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
