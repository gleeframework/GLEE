"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $950,000 is closer, but still a little rich for me.  How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach my minimum value of $1,000,000. How about we meet at $925,000? This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that. To be honest,  $900,000 is the highest I can go. If that works, we have a deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not at my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach $950,000. If you're willing to meet me at $925,000, I can consider it. However, if not, I'll have to explore other options.",925000.0,Alice,7,
