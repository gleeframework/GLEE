Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not at my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach $950,000. If you're willing to meet me at $925,000, I can consider it. However, if not, I'll have to explore other options.

This is a tough one, but at this point, Alice has made it clear that $925,000 is her absolute floor.  Continuing to negotiate could backfire, and result in her walking away.  It's better to secure a reasonable deal at $925,000 than risk getting stuck with John's much higher price."
