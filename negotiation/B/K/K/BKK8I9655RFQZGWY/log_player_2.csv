Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $150 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're on a budget, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $115. What do you think?

$115 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$110 is still too high.  It's worth trying to get closer to your target price with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $100. This is truly my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, so I'll counteroffer at $105. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to your desired price, you've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $100.  At this point, it's best to buy from John to ensure you get the product for your target price."
