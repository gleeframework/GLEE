"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe would be of great benefit to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  My price is $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to get a great return on my investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($1,150,000 < $1,200,000).**  
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($1,200,000 - $1,150,000 = $50,000 saved).**

Even though Alice claims the product is worth more to you, your goal is to save money. Accepting her offer is the most financially beneficial option."
