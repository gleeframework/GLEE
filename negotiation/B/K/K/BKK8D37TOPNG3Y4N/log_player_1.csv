"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $10,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value for both parties. This helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:**  There is room to negotiate lower if Bob rejects, but I don't want to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Early in Negotiations:**  It's only the second round.  There's more room for bargaining and I'm not in a rush to close the deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  Having John's offer of $12,000 as a safety net gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I can see you're serious about getting this product. Let's split the difference.  How about $9,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and move towards an agreement.
* **Positive Language:** Again, I'm using positive and friendly language to keep the negotiation atmosphere amicable.
* **Clear Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for both parties, emphasizing that this deal is beneficial for everyone. 
* **Avoiding John for Now:** While John's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $9,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.
* **Possible Future Deal:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I can potentially establish a relationship with Bob and perhaps negotiate a higher price on a future sale. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at this point seems like the most practical choice."
