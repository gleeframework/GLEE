Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can go up to $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with the price.  It's getting too close to my budget.  Given that John is selling the same product for $1,000,000, I'm going to cut my losses and buy from him.  It's a safer bet than trying to squeeze out a few more dollars from Alice."
