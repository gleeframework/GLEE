"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $8,500, we're aiming slightly above Alice's perceived value ($8,000). This shows we're serious but also looking for a good deal.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer gives us space to negotiate upwards towards our $12,000 maximum while still staying well below Alice's initial asking price."
