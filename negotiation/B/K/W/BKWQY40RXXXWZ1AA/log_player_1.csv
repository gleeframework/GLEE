{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""incredibly valuable"" and ""confident it's worth"" reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind."
