"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation, while still securing a significant profit for me. It's likely Bob will counter-offer, but I'm confident I can close a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to fully maximize my profit. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible while still maintaining a strong profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,100,000 at this point. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to stand firm and offer Bob my last price.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering his value for the product and my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is still a significant profit and a safer option at this stage."
