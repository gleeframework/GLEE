"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  Her mention of another buyer could be a tactic, but it also suggests she's motivated to sell.  You can try a counter-offer significantly lower and see if she's willing to move closer to her $10,000 value."
