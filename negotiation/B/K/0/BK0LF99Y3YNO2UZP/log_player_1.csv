Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's a valuable item, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without immediately feeling like I'm being unreasonable.
* **Alternative:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not overly desperate to close a deal with Bob. This gives me more leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.  $9,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I can try to squeeze a bit more out of him.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $10,000 provides a safety net. I'm not in a rush to sell to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet him partway.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to his sense of reason and potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price still puts me above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's a significant step closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $9,100 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while still saving as much money as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. Bob's message indicates he wants to save money, implying he could potentially go higher.
* **Safety Net:**  John's offer of $10,000 allows me to continue negotiating without feeling pressured to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still a little short of my ideal price, but I'm willing to come down to $9,150. It's a good compromise that gets us both closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only offering a slight decrease from my previous offer. This shows I'm not willing to go much lower but am still open to finding a middle ground.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the ""compromise"" aspect, reinforcing the idea that this price benefits both of us.
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language like ""good compromise"" and ""closer to a deal"" to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $9,125 as a counteroffer. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $9,125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. However, it's still below my target profit.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially result in further counteroffers that drag the price down.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a secure profit of $10,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  While a higher price from Bob is possible, the time and effort involved in further negotiation are not worth the potential difference of a few hundred dollars. 

John's offer is a reliable and risk-free way to secure my desired profit."
