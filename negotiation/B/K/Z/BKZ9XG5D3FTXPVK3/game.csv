"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below what I can consider. To be fair,  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, we are still pretty far apart. To be honest, anything above $700,000 will be tough for me. I could do $700,000 if that works for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the significant value of this product while still being a good deal for you. I'm confident this will be a win-win.",900000.0,Alice,5,
