Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""given its value."" This subtly reminds him of the potential benefits. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, using phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What do you think?"" This invites Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you knew Bob was particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower. However, starting too low can undervalue your product.
* **Market Demand:** If the product was in high demand with other potential buyers besides John, you could justify an even higher initial price."
