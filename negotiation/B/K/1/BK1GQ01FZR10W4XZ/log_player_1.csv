"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great value and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and highlights the value of the product.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hard limit, leaving space for Bob to propose a lower price. 
* **Keeping the option to sell to John:**  I'm aware of my fallback option and ready to use it if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I have 9 rounds remaining, so I can still negotiate with Bob.
* **Potential to get a better price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price.  This might encourage him to increase his offer in the next round.
* **John is a viable option:** I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net, but I'm willing to explore negotiating further with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $750,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to his price.
* **Staying above my minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum of $800,000.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Positive tone:** My message maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is a factor:** We are already in round 4, and each round further increases the risk that I might not be able to close a deal with Bob.
* **John's offer is the same:** John is also offering $800,000.  There's no benefit in delaying to see if I can get a higher price from Bob, especially since I'm already at my minimum.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum desired price without the risk of further negotiations or losing the deal altogether."
