"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the quality and potential this product holds."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value we both recognize in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum. Accepting his offer of $9,500 would leave me at a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $10,000.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
