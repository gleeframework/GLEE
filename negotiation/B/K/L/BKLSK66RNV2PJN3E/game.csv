"Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the quality and potential this product holds.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value we both recognize in this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
