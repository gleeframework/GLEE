"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to give up and buy from John, as I have 10 rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the quality and potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $15,000, it's still above my budget. I have several rounds left and believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm not yet ready to purchase from John as I'm confident I can find a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value we both recognize in this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
