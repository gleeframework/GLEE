"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $13,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
