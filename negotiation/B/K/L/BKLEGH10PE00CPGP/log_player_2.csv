"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price.  You know the product is worth less than $8,000 to you, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

This is your best shot at getting the product at your target price.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation and shows you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still too high. You can likely get a better price, and you still have a few rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

You're still trying to get to your target price, but this counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise slightly while still getting a good deal.  It's also a good strategy to increase your offer incrementally to show progress in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is tempting, you are still within the negotiation window and can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to meet halfway.  Alice is showing signs of coming down, so it's worth pushing a bit more to see if you can close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps you in the game and allows you to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

You're getting closer to your goal. This offer shows you're serious about buying the product, but you're still holding firm on your price range. This should pressure Alice to accept or make a counteroffer closer to your target."
