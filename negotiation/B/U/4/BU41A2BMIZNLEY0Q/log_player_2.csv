"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're getting closer to a deal.  Let's make one last push with a slightly higher counteroffer. If Alice doesn't accept this, it might be time to go with John's offer."

Alice is getting stubborn, and we're running out of time. With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll get a better deal than $1,000,000 from Alice.  It's time to secure the product from John."
