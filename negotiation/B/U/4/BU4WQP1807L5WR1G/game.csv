"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $1,500,000 at this time.  This is my absolute top limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,500,000 is your absolute top limit, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's try $1,650,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
