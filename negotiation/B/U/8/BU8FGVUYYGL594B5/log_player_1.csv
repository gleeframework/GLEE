Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,400,000 is still quite low. Let's settle at $1,650,000 and I think we can have a deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,300,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. While his offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to John's guaranteed offer, I'm still confident I can push for a better deal with a few more rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth every penny. How about we split the difference again and land at $1,475,000? This shows my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Please consider this a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now matched John's offer. There is no longer any potential to gain a higher price from Bob.  It's time to take John's guaranteed $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiations falling through."
