Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $15,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $14,999, Alice aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob:**  The price is slightly below Alice's minimum, potentially making Bob think it's a good deal.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** There's a small chance Bob might counter-offer, allowing Alice to still get closer to her desired price. 

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired price."
