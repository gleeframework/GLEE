"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
