Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  It's in your best interest to take John's offer and secure the product at your target price."
