,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's a significant move toward meeting your needs.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can shake on it.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $1,105,000. This is a significant move on my part, and it's the very edge of my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1105000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,105,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,115,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, and I'd like to see if we can finalize it. Let's see if this is the number that works for you.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but we still have a small gap to bridge. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000. This is truly my final offer, as it's pushing the limits of my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement and finalize this deal.",1110000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to making this deal happen. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,120,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,115,000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1115000.0,Alice,9,
