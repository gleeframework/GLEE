Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a profit beyond my minimum value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a counteroffer closer to my original $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, hopefully encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk going lower, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's still a guaranteed profit."
