"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to try negotiating a lower price with Alice first. While $11,500 is close to my limit, there's still room to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to significantly reduce the price while still leaving me room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $11,000 is still too high. I'm willing to push a little further to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. It seems like we both want to make a deal here. How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
