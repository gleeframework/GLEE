{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $10,000 floor, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  It gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price slightly up or down depending on his response. 

Remember, you can always go to John if the negotiations with Bob stall!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below what you're hoping for.  There's room to negotiate with Bob, and you want to see if you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. It seems like we both want to make a deal here. How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above John's offer.  While it's still lower than your ideal price, it's closer to your goal and reflects a willingness to compromise. It's better to take this offer than to risk losing the deal altogether."
