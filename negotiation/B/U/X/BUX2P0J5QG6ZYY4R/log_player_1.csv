Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with the full value of the product to Bob. This maximizes my potential profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, but also establishes a strong starting point.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer as a safety net, which allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $800,000 is still a significant amount, it's a 20% reduction from my desired price and the product's value to him. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to save money compared to my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him,  reinforcing my position.
* **Fairness:**  The message frames the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more palatable to Bob.
* **Negotiation Continuation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiations open, giving me more time to potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $850,000 is significantly closer to my target price of $1,000,000 than Bob's previous offer. It's a good compromise.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower offer from Bob or even a stalemate. There's a risk of losing more money.
* **Time Factor:**  While I could try for a higher price, it's unclear if Bob is willing to go any higher.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids potential delays.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is higher,  accepting Bob's offer still yields a substantial profit and a quicker sale."
