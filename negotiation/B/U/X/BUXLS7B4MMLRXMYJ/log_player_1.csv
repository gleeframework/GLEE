"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and create a more cooperative environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John now guarantees me $12,000. However, the potential to get a better price from Bob is still worth exploring. I have 9 more rounds to improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that the price is still advantageous for him.
* **Positive and Cooperative Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:**  While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $12,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a high risk of Bob getting even more stubborn and lowering his offer further in the next rounds. I also have 6 rounds left, and it's unlikely I can get a significantly higher price from him.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit, especially considering the value of the product to Bob.

**In summary:**  While it would be ideal to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a quick sale."
