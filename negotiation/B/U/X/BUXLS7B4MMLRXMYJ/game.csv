"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's work together to make this happen.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
