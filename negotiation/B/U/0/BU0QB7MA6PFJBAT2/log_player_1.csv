Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, giving me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. While meeting in the middle might be a good strategy in some situations, it's not feasible here because his offer is too low. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.  It also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a price that's closer to my value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $60 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justify the price:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to support my counteroffer. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that's more profitable for me while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Even though I've already lowered my price twice, I'm not willing to go any lower. It seems like Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum, and further negotiation will likely be unproductive.

Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is my minimum, and a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed profit."
