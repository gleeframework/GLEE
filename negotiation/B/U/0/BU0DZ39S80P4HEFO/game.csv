"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the price you proposed is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I must respectfully decline at $1,900,000. I am still working within a budget of $800,000. Could we perhaps find a compromise closer to my budget? I am willing to consider $1,600,000 as a counteroffer.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
