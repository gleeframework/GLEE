"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $11,000.  This is more than the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a better price than selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is still too low for me, considering the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to his price, I'm still not happy with $9,200.  I'm not desperate, and I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since I have the backup option of selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,000. This is my bottom line, as it's the same price that John is willing to pay. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
