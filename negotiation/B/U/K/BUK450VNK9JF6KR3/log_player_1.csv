Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures you make a significant profit.  It's important to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, so you don't get stuck in a long negotiation that ends with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but I'm confident this price is still fair, considering his original offer and the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to John's price, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal from him at this point. I'm comfortable with the profit from selling to John, so I'll take the safe option."
