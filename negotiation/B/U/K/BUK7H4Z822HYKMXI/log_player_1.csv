"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This is to signal that I'm confident in the product's value.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I also have John as a backup buyer if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum value. This should show Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while also ensuring I get a decent price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me. I'll continue to explore if we can reach a mutually acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll proceed with selling to John."
