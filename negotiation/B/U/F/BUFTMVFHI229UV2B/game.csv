"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle on $11,250? This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875. This would be a win-win for both of us.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $11,125. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",11125.0,Alice,5,
