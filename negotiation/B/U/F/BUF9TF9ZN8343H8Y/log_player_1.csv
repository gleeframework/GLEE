Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,090,000 just isn't quite working for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,105,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to our desired price.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1105000}
