"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1080000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $1,120,000? It's still a good deal for you, as it's well below your estimated value, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let's try to work this out.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $1,090,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,090,000 just isn't quite working for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,105,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to our desired price.  Let's try to make this work.",1105000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $1,095,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1095000.0,Bob,6,
