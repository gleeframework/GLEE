,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
