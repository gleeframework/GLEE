# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $800,000.  There's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her original, it's still too high.  Bob should reject and try for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to give up on a higher price just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects its value to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $850,000. Alice has offered $875,000, which is closer to his goal. He would save $325,000 from his maximum budget of $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will budge much more."
