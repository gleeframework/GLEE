"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  Could we maybe settle at $10,750? I feel that's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,
