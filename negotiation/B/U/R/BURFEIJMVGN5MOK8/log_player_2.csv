"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings to someone like you, given its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than his maximum budget, it's still a significant amount. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I value the product, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, after careful consideration, I would like to propose a revised offer at $11,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to you while being more accessible than the previous offer. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and closer to his initial counteroffer of $10,000.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him ending up buying from John for $15,000 outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without unnecessary risk."
