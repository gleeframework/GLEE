Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, but you can always come down while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high asking price.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still giving Bob a reason to consider the offer seriously."
