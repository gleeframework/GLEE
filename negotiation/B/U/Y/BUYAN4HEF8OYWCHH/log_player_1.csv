Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum.  This product has immense value and I'm confident in its potential to generate substantial returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value it offers and the potential returns it can generate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
