"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you consider something around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. My counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to meeting you in the middle, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. My next offer is $10,000 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",10000.0,Alice,7,
