# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,050,000, and it's her final offer.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is a better deal."
