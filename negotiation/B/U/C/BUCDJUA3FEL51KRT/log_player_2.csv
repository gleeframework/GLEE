Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $700,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000 as a compromise.  This is a significant concession from my initial position, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Explanation:

While Alice's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to your maximum, John's offer is a guaranteed $750,000 in your pocket. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and you risk her sticking to a price higher than John's offer."
