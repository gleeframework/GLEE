"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's potential to get a better deal, especially since you know the product is worth less to her than you're willing to pay."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm comfortable with. How about we aim for $1,150,000? This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,120,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already gone through multiple rounds and there's no guarantee she'll budge further.  I'm confident I can get the product for my maximum price from John, so I'll go with the sure thing."
