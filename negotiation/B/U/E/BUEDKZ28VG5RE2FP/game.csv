"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm comfortable with. How about we aim for $1,150,000? This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,120,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
