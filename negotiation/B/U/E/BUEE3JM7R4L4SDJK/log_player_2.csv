"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob's goal is to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's offer is $1,000 over that.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There are 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Buying from John is a backup:** Bob can always go with John for $8,000, but it's better to try and get a lower price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? That's the absolute highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we settle on $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While closer to Bob's target, $8,750 is still $750 above his maximum. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  There are still 7 rounds left, so further negotiation is possible.  
* **Buying from John is still an option:**  Bob can always secure the product from John for $8,000, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference - how about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high:**  While $8,500 is closer to Bob's target of $8,000, it's still $500 over his limit.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  There are only 5 rounds remaining.  
* **Buying from John is a good option:** Since the difference between Alice's offer and John's price is relatively small, it's starting to make more sense to buy from John, especially considering the limited negotiation rounds left."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $8,000. How about we settle on $8,100?  This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go at this point. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8100}
