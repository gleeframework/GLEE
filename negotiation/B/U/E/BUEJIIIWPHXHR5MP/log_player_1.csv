{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Showing flexibility:** I emphasize that I'm open to negotiation, showing Bob that I'm willing to work with him.
* **Building rapport:**  The message is friendly and aims to start a positive conversation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer or make a new one based on his offer and my knowledge of the product's value. If Bob rejects my offer or counteroffers become too low, I will sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $5000 to $7000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** $6,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's message shows he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate, but his price range is too low. 
* **Exploring alternatives:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer that is more reasonable for both of us, keeping in mind Bob's budget constraints but also ensuring I get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still allows me to make a fair profit while considering your needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying above minimum:** $12,000 is still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  My message remains friendly and encourages further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I will evaluate whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current financial situation, I am comfortable with a price of $9000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  The negotiation is progressing, and Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. There's potential to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees I meet my minimum, but I might be able to secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $9,000 and my minimum of $15,000. I'll try to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This allows me to make a reasonable profit while staying within your budget constraints.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $12,000. This shows a commitment to compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:** $12,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Reiterating the value proposition:**  I remind Bob of the value of the product and the benefit of a deal at this price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I will need to make a decision. I may be willing to come down a bit further, but if he continues to be too far below my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I don't lose money on this deal."
