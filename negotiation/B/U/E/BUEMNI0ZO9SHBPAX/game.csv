"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775,000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $775,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I can do $700,000.  If that works, we have a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate that you've come down, but $725,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you right in the middle at $712,500. This is the best I can do. What do you say?",712500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $720,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",720000.0,Alice,7,
