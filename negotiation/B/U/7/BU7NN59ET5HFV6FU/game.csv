"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that will bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference again. I appreciate the effort, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I can offer you a compromise at $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to bump my offer up a little to $14,500.  It's a fair offer and would save me a good chunk of change compared to your last offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $14,500, which is $15,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
