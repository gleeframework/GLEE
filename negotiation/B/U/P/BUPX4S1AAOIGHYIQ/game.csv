"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product for me.  However, I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
