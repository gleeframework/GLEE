"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money."
