Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your minimum), you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Confidence:** Presenting a strong initial offer conveys the value of the product.

If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your desired minimum price."
