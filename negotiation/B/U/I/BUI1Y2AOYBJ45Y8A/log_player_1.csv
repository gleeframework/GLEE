"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong anchor price significantly higher than our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to our desired outcome. 
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" we create a narrative that supports the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language implies a willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility without committing to large concessions immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, showing he's serious and sees the product's potential. However, $1,800,000 is still below our desired outcome. We have room to negotiate further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value this product brings, particularly to a business like yours, is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects a more realistic compromise while recognizing the long-term benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We lower our price by $200,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate Value:** We continue emphasizing the product's unique benefits tailored to Bob's business, subtly anchoring his perception above his initial valuation.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The price reduction is significant but keeps us well above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation and a potentially higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value the product brings, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer.  While Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our target. We are willing to negotiate further, but we need to start pushing Bob closer to our minimum acceptable price. We are not yet ready to accept a price below $2 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000, but that's my absolute best. This product will transform your business, and I'm confident you'll see incredible ROI with it."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We reduce our price by a smaller amount ($50,000) to signal we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Strong Language:** ""Absolute best"" emphasizes this is a final offer, increasing the perceived value and urgency.
* **Focus on ROI:** We reiterate the product's long-term benefits, justifying the price and potentially swaying Bob's decision.

We're getting close to our walk-away point. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round or two, selling to John might be the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still significantly below our $2 million target. While we could continue negotiating, Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and further concessions from our side would be substantial and potentially eat into our profit margin significantly. 

At this point, it's strategically advantageous to accept John's standing offer of $1,500,000. This guarantees us a sale at a price we've deemed acceptable and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob failing to meet our needs."
