"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the significant returns you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is far beyond his budget of $800,000. He should counteroffer to see if he can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is still significantly below its true value and potential worth to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,700,000 is still well beyond his budget. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
