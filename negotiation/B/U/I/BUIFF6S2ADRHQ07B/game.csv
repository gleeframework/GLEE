"Alice, your offer is way above what I'm comfortable paying. Given my budget, I'm only willing to go as high as $800,000. If you're open to that price, I'm ready to close the deal. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is still significantly below its true value and potential worth to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
