I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a bit higher than what it's worth to him, but I believe it's a fair starting point.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to $90, but I'm also willing to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
