Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120, giving me room for profit.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money.  However, by offering a higher price to Bob, I'm hoping to maximize my earnings."
