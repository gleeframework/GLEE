"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about $11,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob has a significant risk of ending up with a price lower than what John is guaranteeing. Selling to John ensures you get your minimum and avoids further negotiation hassle."
