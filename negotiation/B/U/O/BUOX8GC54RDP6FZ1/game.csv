"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground here.  While I can't quite go down to $11,000, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,200.  I believe this is a very fair price for a product of this quality. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about $11,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",11500.0,Bob,6,
