"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  My initial offer is $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate and creates the perception that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price allows me to make concessions during the negotiation, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the safety net of John's offer ($1,500,000), so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, but I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, the product's value to me is significantly higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but staying above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the product's value to me is higher, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth and trying to increase its perceived value to him.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":**  This phrasing creates an illusion of fairness, potentially making Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price, which is also the same amount John is offering. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the difference is likely to be small, and there's a risk Bob will walk away if I keep negotiating. It's better to take the guaranteed win now."
