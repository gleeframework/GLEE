Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product for $1,700,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting position.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I believe there's room for negotiation as Bob values the product at $800,000, which is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. 

* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's significantly lower than my desired price, I'll make a counter-counteroffer to bring it closer to my target. 
* **If Bob accepts:** I'll be happy to close the deal!

**Note:** This negotiation is just a starting point. The best strategy will depend on Bob's behavior and the specific circumstances of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests that he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. My goal is to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer of $1,200,000 but still lower than my initial offer of $1,700,000. This shows my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I won't lose money on the deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I'll be happy to finalize the deal!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he is unwilling to budge much from his initial offer. There's a significant gap between our desired prices, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a profitable outcome.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000. This eliminates any risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price.

**Decision:**  It's best to secure the guaranteed profit with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, which might not yield a satisfactory result."
