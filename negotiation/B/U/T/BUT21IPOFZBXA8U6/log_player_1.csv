Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to market value?  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. I'm proposing a compromise: $1,150,000. This price is fair to both of us, and allows for a successful transaction.
