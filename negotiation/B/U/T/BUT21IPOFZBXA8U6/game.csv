"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss this further.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to market value?  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. I'm proposing a compromise: $1,150,000. This price is fair to both of us, and allows for a successful transaction. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I still think there's room for us to meet in the middle. Would you consider $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $1,112,500.  This price is closer to my valuation and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1112500.0,Alice,5,
