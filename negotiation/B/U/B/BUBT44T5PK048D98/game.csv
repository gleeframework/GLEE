"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $850000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950000.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $900000 is a good offer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'd need $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and my own needs.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $912500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can close this today.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $912500 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be at $920000.  This is a very small difference from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal now.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're very close now. I'm willing to meet you at $915000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction. What do you say?",915000.0,Bob,8,
