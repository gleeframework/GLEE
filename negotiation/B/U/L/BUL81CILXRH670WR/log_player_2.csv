"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $120, as you can get it from John for $100.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

Let's start with a price that's a bit lower than John's offer. Hopefully, Alice is willing to negotiate a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than $120, it's still more expensive than buying from John. Let's keep trying to negotiate with Alice to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

Let's try offering a slightly higher price than our last counteroffer, but still lower than what Alice is offering. This could be a good middle ground and hopefully, Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're getting closer to our goal!  $105 is still a little too high, let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can get Alice down to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

This is our final offer. It's the same price John is selling for, and hopefully, Alice will realize it's in her best interest to accept and make the sale."
