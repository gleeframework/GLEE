"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the product's potential while still leaving room for a profitable deal for you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still above my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. This offer reflects the maximum I'm able to pay. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
