Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
