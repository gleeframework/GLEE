"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring a profit for myself.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $10,000 to Bob, but I want to see how he reacts to this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer and counter with $13,500. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still trying to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting close to my desired price and represents a good profit for me. Accepting this offer secures a solid deal and prevents the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a sale to John for a lower amount."
