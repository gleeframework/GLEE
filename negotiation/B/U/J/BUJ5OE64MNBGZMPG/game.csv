"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $800,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $500,000?  That feels like a fairer starting point.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about we settle on $550,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $650,000 is tempting, and I can see we're both serious about getting this deal done.  To make this work on my end, how about we split the difference and land at $600,000 even?  That would be a great way to wrap things up.",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $600,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $620,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",620000.0,Alice,7,
