Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you've done some research, but I'm confident the product is worth more than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale. What do you say?
