"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $975000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price.
