"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a significant discount and allows us to both benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still firm on needing a price closer to $800,000.  I'm willing to drop to $775,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below your fallback option of $800,000 from John.  It's better to secure the deal with John now rather than risk the negotiation with Alice breaking down and potentially losing out on the product altogether."
