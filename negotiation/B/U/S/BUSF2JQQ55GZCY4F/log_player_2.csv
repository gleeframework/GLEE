"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! My asking price is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than mine. I should try to negotiate it down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $5,000."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counter-offer to try and anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. This strategy might seem aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation while signaling my budget limitations to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm happy to sell for $9,000.  This is a great price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $9,000 is still above my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll reject and try to negotiate closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm proposing a price that's a clear compromise between her previous offer ($9,000) and my previous counteroffer ($5,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while moving towards a price point that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,500? That way, we both get a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'd accept, but $8,500 is still above what John is offering.  At this point, I think I have some leverage to push Alice a bit further down.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to try and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm ready to make a deal, but I need it to be at $8,000 even.  That's my final offer. If you're willing to work with me on this, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm holding firm at my target price of $8,000. By stating it as my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious and won't budge further. This might be enough to convince her, especially since it's a relatively small difference from her last offer. However, I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if she rejects this counteroffer."
