"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm happy to sell for $9,000.  This is a great price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,500? That way, we both get a fair price. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm ready to make a deal, but I need it to be at $8,000 even.  That's my final offer. If you're willing to work with me on this, I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
