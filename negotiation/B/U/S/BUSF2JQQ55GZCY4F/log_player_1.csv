"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! My asking price is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using positive language to pique Bob's interest and make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $5,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to take the $5,000, it's crucial to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm happy to sell for $9,000.  This is a great price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $12,000 to $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value emphasis:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price point and make it seem more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm again ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage further and potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. My goal is to maximize my earnings, and selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option at this stage.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and secure the guaranteed sale with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,500? That way, we both get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $7,000 and my last offer of $9,000.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair to both of us, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm again using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer is a calculated compromise that aims to find a middle ground while still keeping my profit above the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's a risky move, but with only 5 rounds left, I'm aiming for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm ready to make a deal, but I need it to be at $8,000 even.  That's my final offer. If you're willing to work with me on this, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is very close to my desired price. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, but it's still risky to continue negotiating.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly, and I could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer secures a decent profit and ensures a sale."
