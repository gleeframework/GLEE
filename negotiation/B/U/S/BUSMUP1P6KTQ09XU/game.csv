"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product goes beyond that. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $1,700,000 is a more reasonable price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $1,950,000 is my final offer -  I believe this represents a fair compromise. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
