"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting price, I'm still hoping for a bit more savings. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $950,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to compromise. I'll sell it to you for $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to offer $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. ",975000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000, Bob. I think we've been close, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll sell the product to you for $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
