**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000.  It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed offer at this point rather than risk Bob not reaching a suitable price within the remaining rounds."
