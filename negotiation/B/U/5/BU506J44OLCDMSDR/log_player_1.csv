"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive language:** I'm framing the offer as a mutually beneficial opportunity. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not immediately closing the door to a counteroffer, signaling flexibility. 

**Remember:**  I'm keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through. This serves as a safety net and helps me make informed decisions throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm aiming to close the deal, accepting $1,250,000 is too far below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I still have room to negotiate and improve the price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to explore other options.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to round 3 and send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my previous offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** $1,350,000 is still above my minimum threshold, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and emphasizing the potential for a successful deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see Bob's response. If he accepts, we've struck a deal. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate and adapt my strategy based on his responses and my remaining time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for improvement:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum threshold.  While I could continue negotiating, there's little chance of getting a better price from Bob.
* **John offers certainty:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a sale at my minimum price. There's no risk of further negotiation or rejection.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the potential for a better deal with Bob is diminishing, and the risk of not closing a deal is increasing.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the current situation and my desire to maximize my earnings, selling the product to John is the most logical and risk-free option at this point."
