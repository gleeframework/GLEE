"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $2,300,000 is a bit high for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
