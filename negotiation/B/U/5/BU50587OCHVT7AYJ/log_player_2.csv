Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is the lowest I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
