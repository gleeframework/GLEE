Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum desired price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. It also shows Bob that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum desired price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is exactly my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by going back and forth further.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
