**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You can get the product for $900,000 from Alice, which is significantly less than the $1,500,000 John is asking.
* **You're saving money.**  Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you're still getting it for a price that's within your budget and saves you a substantial amount compared to John."
