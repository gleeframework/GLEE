Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and while my asking price is $19,000,  I'm willing to be flexible for a quick sale. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we can afford to start higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more in control and potentially leading to a quicker deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a higher asking price, we create the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thought. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and your risk appetite, you could adjust the price and message accordingly."
