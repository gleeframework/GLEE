"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I want to give Bob the opportunity to negotiate, but I also want to make it clear that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning that I have other potential buyers, I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Positive Language:**  Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""very valuable"" helps create a positive impression and encourages Bob to see the value in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can still potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Not Willing to Settle for Less:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great value for you. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows flexibility while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm positioning this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency. This could motivate Bob to accept before potentially losing the deal.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob that even at $1,350,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The mention of ""other potential buyers""  is a subtle reminder that I have options and may not be willing to wait indefinitely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  While Bob is showing some willingness to compromise, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Risk of Losing to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm not desperate. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to stay within your budget. If you're not able to accept this, then I'll have to move on to other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final concession, signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to go lower.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that $1,300,000 is a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and a win-win scenario.
* **Urgency:**  I'm again reminding Bob that I have other options and won't wait indefinitely.
* **Budget Focus:**  I'm reiterating the budget aspect to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,290,000? That's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to move closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still some room for negotiation, and I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle for less.
* **Potential to Get Closer:**  I believe with further negotiation, I can likely get Bob to come up a bit higher.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is a tempting option, I'm not desperate to close the deal and want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,290,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not there yet.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1,295,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'll have to move on to my other buyer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1295000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create urgency.
* **Compromise:**  I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise by meeting Bob halfway.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm again reminding Bob that I have other options.
* **Clear Decision Point:**  I'm making it clear that Bob needs to make a decision now.

**Important Note:** 

* I'm getting closer to Bob's perceived value, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* With only a few rounds left, it's important to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $1,290,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a decisive move.
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price and there's very little room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate.  By selling to John, I guarantee a price that meets my minimum.
* **Minimizing Risk:** It's better to guarantee a sale for $1,500,000 than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or not closing the deal at all."
