Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This offer is strategically chosen. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than the price John is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a higher profit for Alice, but also gives Bob a chance to acquire the product at a price that's still beneficial to him."
