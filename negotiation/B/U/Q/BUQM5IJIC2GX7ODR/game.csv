"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers and I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm really interested in getting this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not all the way to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $10,750.  It's a fair price, and it's the most I can afford right now. I truly hope we can make this work.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,750. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings",11250.0,Alice,7,
