Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, as it's worth that much to me. If he rejects, I'll immediately turn to John and sell it for $1,000,000. There's no point in negotiating further with Bob if he's not willing to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to hold out for a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to his offer, but still above his value for the product. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to buy. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum. The risk of further negotiation is too high. I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a solid profit."
