"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $13,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?  That's a fair offer, considering its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is simply too low for the value this product offers. To be frank, I have another potential buyer lined up at $10,000.  I'm willing to let it go to you for $9,500, but that's my final offer. It's a fantastic deal you won't want to miss.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for clarifying.  I understand your position, but I can't go higher than $7,500.  That's already a stretch for me, but I believe the product is worth it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,6,
