Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?  That's a fair offer, considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is simply too low for the value this product offers. To be frank, I have another potential buyer lined up at $10,000.  I'm willing to let it go to you for $9,500, but that's my final offer. It's a fantastic deal you won't want to miss."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for clarifying.  I understand your position, but I can't go higher than $7,500.  That's already a stretch for me, but I believe the product is worth it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob is not moving significantly towards my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll reach $9,500, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
