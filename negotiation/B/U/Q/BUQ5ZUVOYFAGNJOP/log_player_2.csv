Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for clarifying.  I understand your position, but I can't go higher than $7,500.  That's already a stretch for me, but I believe the product is worth it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
