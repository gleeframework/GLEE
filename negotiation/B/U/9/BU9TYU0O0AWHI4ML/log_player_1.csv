Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  By offering $150, I'm aiming to get a good price while still being open to negotiation.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $80 is below my minimum threshold of $100.  While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what I consider its worth.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum threshold, and it's a good deal considering John is also willing to pay $100.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since I don't know his maximum willingness to pay.  It's better to lock in this deal and secure the sale."
