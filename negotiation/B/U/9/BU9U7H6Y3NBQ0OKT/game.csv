"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. I understand its value to you, and this price allows for a fair margin for both of us. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment, but if not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  Please let me know your decision.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
