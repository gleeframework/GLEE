"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can do better than $900,000.  You want to try and get closer to your $800,000 goal.  Let's see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

Let's start with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a range that might be acceptable to her, considering she values the product at $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $880,000 is getting closer to your target. While you can still try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or needing to buy from John for a higher price is increasing.  It's a good deal, and it's better to secure it now rather than risk losing it."
