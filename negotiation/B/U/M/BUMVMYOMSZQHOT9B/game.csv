"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm really interested in your product, though. How about $12000?  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is our minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to make this work. How about $13500?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. $13500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $12500. That's my absolute max, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
