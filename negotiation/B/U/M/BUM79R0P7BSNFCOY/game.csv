,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the value this product brings.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,025,000. Can you consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $1,025,000 is still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $1,075,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced $1,075,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the price. How about we meet at $1,050,000, and I'll also get a 5% discount on the total price if I commit to buying the product within the next 6 months?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a discount, but 5% is a bit too high for me. Let's focus on the price first. I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's get this deal finalized.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,060,000, but I'm still not convinced it's the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, and I'll also throw in a condition that I'd like to have a 2-year warranty on the product. Can you consider that?",1030000.0,Bob,8,
