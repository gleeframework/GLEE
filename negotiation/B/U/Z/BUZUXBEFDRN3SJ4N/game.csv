"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to do $140?  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's make this happen!",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $150?  That's my absolute max, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
