The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $17,000. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,250.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

While $16,250 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price further."
