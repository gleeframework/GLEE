"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is fair considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000, but I can see that's not feasible for you. Let me make a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'm still not getting the price I want. Let me think for a moment... I can do $1,080,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
