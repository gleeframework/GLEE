"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 90. How about we meet in the middle at 110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there yet, but I'd be willing to pay $105. That would be a good middle ground for us both.  Let me know what you think!",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we try 107.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",107.5,Alice,5,
