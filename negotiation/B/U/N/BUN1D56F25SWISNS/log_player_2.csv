"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $795,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation and go with John. You'll save a small amount and avoid potentially pushing Alice away completely if you try to negotiate further."
