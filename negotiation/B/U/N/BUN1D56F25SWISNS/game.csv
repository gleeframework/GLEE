"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $825,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. How about $760,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
