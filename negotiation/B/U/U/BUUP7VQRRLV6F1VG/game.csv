"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm not sure I can justify $1500000 right now. I'd be willing to offer $1200000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant investment for you, but I believe the potential returns will far outweigh the cost.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1250000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final compromise.  $1300000 is my absolute lowest price. This is a fair offer for both of us, and it allows me to move on with this transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $1275000. This is a small adjustment, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to stay firm on $1300000.  With only a few rounds left, we're running out of time to come to an agreement.  If this deal doesn't work out, I'll have to move on to other options.  I'm confident you'll see the value of this product and come to a decision soon.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
