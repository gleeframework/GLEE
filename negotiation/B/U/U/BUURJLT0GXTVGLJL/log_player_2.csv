"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still a chance Alice might be willing to come down, and even if not, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This is my best offer, and it's still a good deal for you since it's more than half of what you're asking."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $22,000 is closer to the value this product provides. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects the true value and is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate. Bob can still potentially get a better deal or secure the product from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $19,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but we're just too far apart on price. I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher amount. To be fair to you, I'm willing to accept $16,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's budget. While it's tempting to accept due to her claim of another buyer, Bob can still try to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be bluffing or she may still be willing to come down.  If not, Bob has the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
