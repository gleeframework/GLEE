"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, potentially influencing him to propose counteroffers closer to your desired range. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value, setting a confident tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his own valuation, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  You have room to negotiate and try to bring Bob closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By decreasing your price to $1,650,000, you show flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying well above both Bob's valuation and your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake.
* **Justification:**  You frame the price reduction as a significant concession on your part, aiming to make Bob feel he's getting a better deal.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning your commitment subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to take your offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I propose a price of $1,550,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000). While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit above your guaranteed option."
