"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's something that I know will be incredibly useful to you. My initial asking price is $1200000, a fair price considering its true value.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This would still allow you to get a great deal on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  While John offers a certain price, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your asking price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $975000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference again - $1012500. This would be a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my ideal budget. John is offering a guaranteed price within my budget, and I've already used 5 rounds of negotiation.  It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price and avoid further potential negotiation with Alice."
