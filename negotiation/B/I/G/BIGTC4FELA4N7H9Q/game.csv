"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's something that I know will be incredibly useful to you. My initial asking price is $1200000, a fair price considering its true value.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This would still allow you to get a great deal on a valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your asking price, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $975000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $975000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference again - $1012500. This would be a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
