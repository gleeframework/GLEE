Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1250000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to what you're willing to pay, it's still not a good deal for you.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best option to try to reach a mutually acceptable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point.  $1175000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1225000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's likely that you'll end up paying more than you're comfortable with.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is the best option in this situation, as it guarantees you the product at your desired price point."
