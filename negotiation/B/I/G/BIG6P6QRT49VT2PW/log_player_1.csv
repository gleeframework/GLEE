{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above the product's value to Bob. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still giving you a good starting point.  Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you can always counter or sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1350000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price.  There's still a chance we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,250,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1175000.  This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,175,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired target. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. There's still potential for a better deal, and selling to John at $1,200,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point.  $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
