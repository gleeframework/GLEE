"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1250000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1175000.  This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point.  $1175000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1225000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
