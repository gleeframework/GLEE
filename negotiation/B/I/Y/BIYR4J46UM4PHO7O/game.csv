"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to move down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the immense value it holds. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
