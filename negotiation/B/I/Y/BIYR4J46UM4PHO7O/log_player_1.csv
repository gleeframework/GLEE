Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000.

Round 3

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach a figure close enough to my $1,000,000 valuation in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
