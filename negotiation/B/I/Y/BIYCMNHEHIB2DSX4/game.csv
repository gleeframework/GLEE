"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,250,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, considering my own valuation and the potential for a successful partnership.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's meet halfway - I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product, which reflects a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
