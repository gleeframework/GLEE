Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,250,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, considering my own valuation and the potential for a successful partnership. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
