"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $175 is way above his budget of $100. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can't go higher than $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $125 is better than $175, he's still trying to stay under $100.  He should try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $110? I'm really hoping we can reach a deal, as I'm very interested in the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $115?  It's a small step up, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While $115 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his goal of $100. He's already been through several rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely he'll get Alice to go any lower. It's better to secure the product at a known, affordable price from John."
