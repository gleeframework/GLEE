"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$7,500 is a good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. There's room for negotiation to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages Alice to come down in price.  It's important to note that this is a strong counteroffer, and Alice might reject it. However, it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit further, and while $7,200 isn't my ideal price, it's a good deal considering my $12,000 backup option with John.  Accepting this offer saves me $4,800 compared to John, and it seems like Alice is unlikely to drop much lower at this point.  It's important to balance saving money with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
