"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10800.0,Alice,3,
