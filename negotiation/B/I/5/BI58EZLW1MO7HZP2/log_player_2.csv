# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $20000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. I need to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is significantly below what this product is worth, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $17500? It's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,500 is still above my budget. While she is willing to compromise, I want to push for a lower price closer to my maximum budget. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I can go up to $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us to both find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget limitations, but $12000 is still too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a fair price that allows for both our needs to be met.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget.  While she's showing a willingness to compromise, I'm still hesitant to go above my initial target of $12,000. I'll counteroffer one more time in the next round, but if she rejects it again, I'll be forced to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. However, $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000,  which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're getting closer. $13000 is a significant increase, but it's still a little below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'll offer the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price that allows us to both be satisfied with the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my maximum budget. While we're getting closer, I'm running out of time and rounds. I'm not confident I can negotiate a lower price before the 10 rounds are up. It's more financially prudent to buy from John at $10,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
