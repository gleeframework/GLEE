,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $950,000?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still trying to get to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000.  However, I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both move forward.",925000.0,Alice,5,
