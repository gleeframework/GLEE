"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,000,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a better alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $950,000?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $950,000 is closer to his limit, he can still get a better price from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still trying to get to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000.  However, I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. At this point, with several rounds of negotiation behind him, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers is high. Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with."
