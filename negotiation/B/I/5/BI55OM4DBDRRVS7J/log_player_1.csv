Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $950,000?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $900,000 is closer to my goal, it's still not enough. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000.  However, I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This would be a good compromise, and we can both move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
