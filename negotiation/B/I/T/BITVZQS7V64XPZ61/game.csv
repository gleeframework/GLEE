"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, my budget currently sits at $1500000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? ",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1750000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than my comfortable price point. Let's aim for a middle ground -  I'm willing to offer $1625000. This represents a significant step from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in this product.  What do you think? ",1625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1625000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $1675000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1675000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1625000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I truly believe this product is worth that price. What do you say?",1625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $1675000 is too low for me, so I will offer $1700000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
