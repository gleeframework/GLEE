Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to potentially get the best possible price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $12,000 is Bob's perceived value, starting at $11,500 leaves room for him to counter-offer and still land within a range profitable for you. 
* **John as a Backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism. If you open too high (e.g., $11,900), Bob might be immediately turned off and not counter-offer."
