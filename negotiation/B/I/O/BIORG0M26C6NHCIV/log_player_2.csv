# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,067,000 is still slightly above your target price of $1,000,000. You've been negotiating for a while, and the difference is relatively small. However, with only 3 rounds remaining, the time pressure is increasing. You're confident that you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's safer to go with the sure thing and end the negotiation with Alice."
