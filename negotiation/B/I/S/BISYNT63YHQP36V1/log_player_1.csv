Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $100, so $130 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for him to counteroffer without you losing too much.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  $130 is a fair price, considering the value to Bob. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below your preferred price point. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counteroffer and hopefully find a price closer to your ideal $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down to $125, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Moves you closer to Bob's offer:**  It shows flexibility and signals you are willing to negotiate.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $125 is higher than John's offer, so you're still getting a better price.
* **Leaves room for a potential agreement:** Bob might be willing to meet you halfway at $125, or you might be able to agree on a price slightly lower than $125."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was really hoping to get it for $115. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is still more than selling to John, it's now getting close to my minimum.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get closer to my preferred price of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. How about we split the difference and go with $120? I'm really hoping to close this deal with you."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  Meeting halfway is a strong signal you are serious about making a deal.
* **Is still profitable:**  $120 is above your minimum and much better than selling to John.
* **Offers a fair price:**  Bob is getting a good price, and you're getting a price you're comfortable with."
