Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than $800,000, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired value. Bob is clearly interested, and by rejecting his offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further, but also my expectation of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering $1,050,000.  This would still leave you with a significant profit and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more economical. Would you consider $950,000? It's a fair offer that acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. By rejecting his offer, I keep the pressure on and signal that I'm not going to settle for a low price. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about aiming for a more economical price, and I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm offering $1,000,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product for a competitive price while ensuring I get a fair value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  $975,000 is significantly better than the $800,000 I'd get from John, and it's close enough to my desired price to accept.  It's a good compromise, and it's likely that Bob wouldn't go any higher."
