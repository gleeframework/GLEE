"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering $1,050,000.  This would still leave you with a significant profit and would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more economical. Would you consider $950,000? It's a fair offer that acknowledges the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point about aiming for a more economical price, and I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm offering $1,000,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product for a competitive price while ensuring I get a fair value. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
