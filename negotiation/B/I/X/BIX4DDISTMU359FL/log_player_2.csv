"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values the product at $100, so there's room for compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It shows you're serious about getting a good deal while still leaving room for Alice to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're comfortable paying. While $125 is closer to your ideal price, you're still in a better position to negotiate further. The goal is to secure the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your ideal range. The offer is still within your maximum budget and leaves room for Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is a good deal for you. It's less than your maximum budget of $150 and also less than the previous counteroffer.  Although you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without taking unnecessary risks."
