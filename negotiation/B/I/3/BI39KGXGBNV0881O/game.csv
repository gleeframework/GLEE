"I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the product is worth $600,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your valuation. I can come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $700,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
