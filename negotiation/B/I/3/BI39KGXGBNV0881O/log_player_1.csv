Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the product is worth $600,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your valuation. I can come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $700,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum threshold.  John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is a better outcome than further risky negotiations with Bob."
