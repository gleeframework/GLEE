{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is fair for both of us. It gives Bob a good discount while still allowing me to make a profit that is above my minimum threshold.  I've included a message that is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
