Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate down from a higher price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest and allows for potential negotiation towards a mutually beneficial price.
* **Justification:**  While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you can justify it by highlighting the product's unique features and the benefit of acquiring it immediately. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging the possibility of settling for your guaranteed sale to John."
