Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm also keeping John as a fallback option, so I'm not under too much pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
