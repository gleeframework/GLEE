"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives us some room to negotiate and allows me to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  Bob's offer is too low. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This shows flexibility while also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can get a better price, especially with the limited rounds remaining.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm continuing to lower the price but  keeping it above my minimum.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, so this is my final attempt at a higher price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept his next offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer being only slightly below my minimum, it's time to accept. There's a chance I could get a slightly better price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to settle with John is too high."
