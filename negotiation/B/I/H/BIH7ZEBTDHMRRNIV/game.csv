"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality. While I acknowledge its value, $175 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $140. Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $155 for the product. This is still slightly above the original $150, but lower than my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value while remaining accessible to you. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still slightly higher than my comfort zone.  Let's try $145. I believe this price is fair and allows us to close the deal. What are your thoughts?",145.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. After considering your offer, I am willing to accept $147 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties and allows us to conclude the transaction. I hope this meets your expectations.",147.0,Alice,5,
