Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy involved:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" aim to create a perception of high desirability and scarcity.
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial high price leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still move down while remaining well above your minimum.
* **Confidence:** Presenting the offer confidently can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your agreement with John. If he knew your bottom line, he would have no incentive to offer more than $800,000."
