"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $11500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. However, given my valuation of the product, I am unable to agree to $11500. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $11000. This aligns more closely with what I consider a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
