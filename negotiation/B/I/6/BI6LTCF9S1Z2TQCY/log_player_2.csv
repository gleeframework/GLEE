"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. It's possible Alice will accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
