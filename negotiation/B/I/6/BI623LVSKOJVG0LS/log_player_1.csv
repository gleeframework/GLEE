Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $150.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but below your minimum acceptable price of $120. This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  Giving you room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  A higher starting point makes it seem like there's more potential for a deal.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he counters with a much lower price, it might signal that he's not serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it, which is closer to my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum acceptable price. There's no point in rejecting it and risking further negotiation, as you're not likely to get a better offer."
