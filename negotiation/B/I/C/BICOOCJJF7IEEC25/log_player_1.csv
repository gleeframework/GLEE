{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Bob:** I'm highlighting the product's value to him, hoping to increase his desire to buy.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm open to negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Protecting my interests:** I've set a firm minimum price, so if Bob's counteroffers get too low, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1350000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $1,350,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable offer of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. There's a $100,000 gap between his offer and my minimum, which provides room for negotiation.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John immediately would secure a profit, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore the possibility of a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That would be a fair compromise and a great deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to incentivize him to accept a higher price.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  While this counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum price, allowing me to potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I am still not able to go above $1375000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  It's unlikely I can get a significantly better offer from Bob.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate but has also set his limit.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially ending up with John's offer, which is much lower.
* **Securing a profit:**  This offer still provides a substantial profit for me.  It's important to balance potential gains with the risk of losing a sale altogether."
