"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this under $100. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm serious about wanting this product, and this is the best I can do.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $110 is still a little too low for me. How about we compromise at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
