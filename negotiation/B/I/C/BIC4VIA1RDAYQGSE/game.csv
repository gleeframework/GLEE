"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront about the value to me. However, $140 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be happy to pay $130 for it, as that's closer to what I'm willing to spend. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $130, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
