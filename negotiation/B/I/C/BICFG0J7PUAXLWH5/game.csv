"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,700. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,400. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest,  $10,000 is the highest I can go. If you're unable to meet that, I completely understand, but I might need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
