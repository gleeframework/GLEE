Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, as it's a reasonable starting point above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will find it appealing, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counter-offering at $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to go lower."
