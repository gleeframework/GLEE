"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $155?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, but I'm willing to make a small concession to $157.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",157.5,Alice,5,
