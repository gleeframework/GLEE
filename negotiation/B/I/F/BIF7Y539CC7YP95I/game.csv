"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than its true worth to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal happen.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, I still feel that $1,900,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement that is acceptable for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
