"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire a truly unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin with an offer significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge his eagerness. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains positive and open, suggesting a willingness to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated value of the product. While his message suggests budget constraints, it's likely a negotiation tactic. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  Show Bob that you're not willing to settle for a low price, reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:**  Avoid getting anchored to his low offer, keeping the possibility of a higher final price alive. 
* **Explore Alternatives:**  While you have John as a backup, you still have time to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must admit I'm surprised by the figure. This product offers significant and unique value, which my initial price reflected.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Ground:** The message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer but maintains that the initial price was justified. Coming down by $200,000 demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value again to justify the high price point and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The offer is phrased as a ""fair compromise,"" encouraging Bob to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now significantly increased his offer to $1,100,000. This is a strong price, exceeding your guaranteed sale to John. While you might be able to extract a bit more from Bob, the risk of him walking away increases as you keep negotiating.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a $100,000 profit over your guaranteed offer and a good return on your investment.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After four rounds, negotiations can stall. Bob has shown a willingness to move, but further progress might be slow.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a higher price from Bob risks him accepting your previous offer or walking away entirely. 

Accepting the $1,100,000 offer secures a substantial profit with minimal risk at this point."
