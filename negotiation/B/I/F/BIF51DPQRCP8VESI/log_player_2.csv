Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
