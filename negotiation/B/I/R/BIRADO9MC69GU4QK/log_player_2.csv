"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can definitely do better than $12,000. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This way we both get a good deal, and we can move forward with the transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

You're still $1,000 above your desired price. It's worth trying to get closer to that $10,000 mark."
