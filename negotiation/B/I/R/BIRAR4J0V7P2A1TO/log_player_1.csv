"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product.  Let's find some middle ground â€“ how about $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $800,000.  That's my firm limit, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product.  While selling to John is an option, there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  However, $800,000 remains below the product's true worth.  To avoid wasting time, would you consider $1,100,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can't go beyond $800,000. If you can't meet that, I appreciate the time we've spent, but I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has clearly stated his maximum price and is unwilling to budge. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids potentially wasting more time with Bob."
