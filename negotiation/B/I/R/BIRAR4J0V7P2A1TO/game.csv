"Hello Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product.  Let's find some middle ground â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $800,000.  That's my firm limit, and I believe it's a fair offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  However, $800,000 remains below the product's true worth.  To avoid wasting time, would you consider $1,100,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can't go beyond $800,000. If you can't meet that, I appreciate the time we've spent, but I may need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
