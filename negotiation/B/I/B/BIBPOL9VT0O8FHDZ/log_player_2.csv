"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. It's worth exploring Alice's potential willingness to go lower before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($10,000) will gauge Alice's seriousness about selling. This move is likely to provoke a counteroffer from Alice, allowing for further negotiation within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. It's still worth trying to get a lower price. While $11,000 is closer to my ideal price, there's still room for improvement. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a clear indication that she's willing to negotiate. My previous counteroffer of $10,000 was too low, but $10,500 is a reasonable compromise. This offer shows a willingness to meet halfway while still aiming for a price lower than $11,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now matched my counteroffer of $10,500.  This is a good price for me, considering my maximum budget is $15,000 and John is selling it for $15,000.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a significant discount and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or running out of rounds."
