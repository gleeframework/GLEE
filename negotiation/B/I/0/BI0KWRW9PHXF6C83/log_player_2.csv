"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. There's no point in accepting it. You can get the product for cheaper from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to establish my price range. This price is still above my maximum willingness to pay ($120), but it's a starting point for negotiation. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I have a few more rounds to negotiate, and I can potentially get a better price from Alice. There's a chance she might come down further with subsequent counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's most recent one. It's a significant step closer to my maximum budget, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this price might be tempting for Alice considering it's closer to her value of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I'm only one round away from being able to buy from John for $120.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time, and if Alice rejects, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm offering my maximum willingness to pay, which is the same price as John's offer. If Alice rejects this, I will buy the product from John."
