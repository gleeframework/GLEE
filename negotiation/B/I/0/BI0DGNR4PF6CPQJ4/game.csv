"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your budget,  $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1350000? This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1275000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
