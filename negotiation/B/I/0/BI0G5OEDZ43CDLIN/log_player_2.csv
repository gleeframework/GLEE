Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,900. I'll meet you at $8,100, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has stated this is her final offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk Alice will walk away. Accepting $8,100 gets me the product at a price significantly lower than John's $10,000 offer."
