Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential $300,000 difference ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) where both you and Bob can benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal acceptable. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might make Bob hesitant.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. "", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps it professional and highlights the product's value.
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000  splits the difference in the negotiation space, leaving room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while ensuring you get significantly more than your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information you might have about Bob (his personality, urgency to buy, etc.), you could adjust the price and message accordingly."
