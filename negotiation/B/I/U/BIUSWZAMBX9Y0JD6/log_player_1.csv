Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal quickly.  If Bob rejects, we'll see where we can land in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, so I will reject it for now.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a compromise with Bob that will be fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally within my minimum acceptable range, and it's a better deal than selling to John. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
