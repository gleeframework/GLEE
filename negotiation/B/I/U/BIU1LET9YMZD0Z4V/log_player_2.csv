"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. What would you say to an investment of $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a tempting offer, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. How about we meet halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's offer of $13,000 is still cheaper than John's offer of $15,000.  While there's always a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
