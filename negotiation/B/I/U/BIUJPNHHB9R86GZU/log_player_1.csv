Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this valuable product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's worth a great deal. How does $120 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer at $100, Alice can aim for a higher price with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $120 offer represents a 20% markup, which is a reasonable starting point in many negotiations. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the message's phrasing suggests some flexibility, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above $100."
