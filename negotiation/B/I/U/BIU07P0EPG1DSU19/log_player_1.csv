Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me."

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm at my minimum price, I think I can still get a slightly better deal by counteroffering in the next round.  I'm still hopeful that Bob will be willing to pay more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering $90. This is a final compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I will be forced to sell to John in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to sell to John. Even though Bob is offering slightly more than John, we've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. I need to ensure I get a reasonable profit, and selling to John guarantees that."
