It's always a good idea to try to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price from Alice.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and her offer is significantly lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not happy with that price. I'll try to get a better deal by counteroffering again."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $875,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. Hopefully, she'll accept this time."

Alice has come down quite a bit, and this price is getting close to my ideal.  I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price, so it's probably worth accepting her offer."
