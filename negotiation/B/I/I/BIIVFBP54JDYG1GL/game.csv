"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $950000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1020000?",1020000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm going to make a firm offer of $1060000. This is my last concession, so I expect you to consider it seriously.",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a firm offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1035000?",1035000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I've already met you at $1060000 and you're still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to make one more offer, but I'm not going to give you any more concessions. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1000000 if you don't accept my next offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1080000. This is my final offer.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
