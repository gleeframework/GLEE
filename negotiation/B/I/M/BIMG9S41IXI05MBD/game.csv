"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be good for me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000? ",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $950,000 is still beyond my spending limit.  Could you consider coming down to $800,000 even? That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up, and I understand your budget constraints.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can't go below $900,000. I believe that's a fair and final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
