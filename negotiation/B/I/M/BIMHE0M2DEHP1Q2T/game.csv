"While I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This represents a fair value for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still allows you to save some money, but also reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while to sell the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
