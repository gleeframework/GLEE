"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000 right now, but I'm open to negotiating further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price considering its value to you. Let's try to meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500. While it's lower than my initial asking price, it's still a decent profit for me and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely. It's important to recognize that this negotiation has been ongoing and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, but there's also the risk of him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer minimizes the risk and secures a sale."
