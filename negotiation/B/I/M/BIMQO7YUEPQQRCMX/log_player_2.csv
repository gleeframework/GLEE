"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still above his maximum price point of $80.  He should reject the offer and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a significant counteroffer, but still leaving room for potential compromise.  He's aiming to find a price that is a good deal for him while also being fair to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $80.  While $100 is a better offer than the previous round, it's still above his target.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to do $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price that's closer to his maximum while still showing willingness to compromise.  He's trying to find a sweet spot that will be acceptable to both of them. By proposing $95, he's demonstrating that he's willing to meet Alice halfway again, showing good faith and increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $80.  While $102 is a better offer than the previous round, it's still above his target.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down further. He's also got the option of buying from John for $80 if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $102 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider $97?  This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you still make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a price closer to his maximum, but he's also acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit. By offering $97, he's demonstrating his commitment to finding a solution that works for both parties. He's also trying to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise further. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob may consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $97. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. How about we meet at $105? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has shown a reluctance to come down to a price that works for him. At this point, Alice's offer of $105 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While there are a few rounds remaining, it's unlikely that Alice will be willing to drop the price significantly enough to make it worthwhile for Bob to continue negotiating.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $80."
