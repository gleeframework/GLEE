Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very special product I think you'd be interested in. It's a unique opportunity that could be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking $1,500,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,500,000 as a starting point. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Intriguing Message:** I'm using a message that highlights the product's potential value without revealing too much. This is to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a baseline. If the negotiation falls below that point, I can walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:** Bob's counteroffer is still significantly higher than John's offer. There's room to potentially get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  By rejecting the offer, I can continue to negotiate with Bob and potentially extract a higher price.  

**Next Move:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000 or $1,450,000. I will be ready to lower the price further if necessary, but I want to see if I can get a better deal than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the unique value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiation:** I'm countering Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not at his price yet.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** The counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but keeps the negotiation moving towards a potentially more favorable outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the unique value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to come down slightly further, but I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be enticing enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the price reduction, but I still think $1400000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $1325000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still lower than my ideal, the difference is now relatively small. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away or become less interested in the product.  
* **Securing a Profit:**  Selling for $1,325,000 is still significantly higher than selling to John. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd love to push for a slightly higher price, I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a deal and avoid risking a complete breakdown in negotiations."
