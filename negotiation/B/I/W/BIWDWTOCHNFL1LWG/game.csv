"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great price for you, given the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,400,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This is a very reasonable price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to offer $1,450,000.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept and still make this deal worthwhile. Let's finalize this and avoid further rounds of back and forth.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
