Round 6

While we could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,150,000 is a substantial profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away, especially since he's made a reasonable offer. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the capital sooner and potentially generate further returns. 

Accepting Bob's offer balances risk and reward, maximizing our likelihood of a favorable outcome."
