"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $85, so I'm offering it to you for $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $102.50 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $85. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $97.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",97.5,Alice,5,
