Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $9,500?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,250 is still significantly lower than what I need.  How about $9,750? That's a compromise from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough to meet my minimum goal of $12,000. With only four rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to guarantee I get my desired price."
