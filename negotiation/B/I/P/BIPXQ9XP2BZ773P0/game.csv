"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product, recognizing its value to you.  Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you in the middle at $11,000. This way, we both benefit from the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  This allows me to stay within my budget while still recognizing the value of the product for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'll meet you at $10,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
