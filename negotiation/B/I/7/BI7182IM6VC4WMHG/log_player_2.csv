"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but you can still save money.**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $11,500.  
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a lower price than $11,500. 

By rejecting the offer, you open the door to a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  You want to start with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Strategic lowball:** A counteroffer of $10,500 signals your intention to negotiate and sets the tone for a back-and-forth.
* **Leaving room:** This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to save a significant amount compared to her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good.**  Alice's new offer is $11,000 which is lower than her previous offer and still below your maximum price of $12,000. 
* **Continuing negotiation is risky.**  While you could try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and you could end up with John's higher price.

By accepting this offer, you secure a lower price than John's and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
