Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer starts at a high price, but leaves room for negotiation. It's a strategic move that allows for potential gain while still appealing to Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get closer to my target price of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $11,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway while still securing a better price than John's offer."
