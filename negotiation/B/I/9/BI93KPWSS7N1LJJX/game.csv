"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is around $15,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value of the product to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This gives you a good profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not quite comfortable with $10,250, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the market value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
