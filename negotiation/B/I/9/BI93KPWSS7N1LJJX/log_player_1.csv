Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is around $15,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This gives you a good profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.
