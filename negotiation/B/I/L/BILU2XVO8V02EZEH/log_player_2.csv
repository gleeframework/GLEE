"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's still room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting the offer might push Alice to lower her price further."
