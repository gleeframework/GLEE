"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. This price is still fair to both of us, as it's well above your value and within my range. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This price is still a good deal for me, and it's getting closer to my original value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
