"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a bit high, but $10,000 is significantly less than what it's worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you think the product is worth more, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we try $15,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's consistently staying below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond $14,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
