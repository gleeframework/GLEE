{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I think I can still squeeze out a better deal in the remaining rounds."
