"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you be open to discussing a more reasonable price? My maximum offer is $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value the opportunity to work with you, $1,600,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This would allow both of us to achieve a fair outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for being flexible. However, based on my financial situation, I can't agree to $1,650,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
