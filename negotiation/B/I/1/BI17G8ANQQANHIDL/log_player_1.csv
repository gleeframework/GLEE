Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer, and I can then negotiate down to a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** Even if Bob counters with a low offer, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $150.

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a good price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is showing interest, so I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation just yet. 
* **Counteroffer potential:**  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's a significant compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and suggesting a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you meet me in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:**  It's possible that we could continue to negotiate, but the incremental gains are small.  At this point, the risk of spending more time negotiating and ending up with a lower price outweighs the potential for a slight increase.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, which guarantees me a profit.

Selling to John is the most sensible decision as it provides a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum requirements."
