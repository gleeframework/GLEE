Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested buyer waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. Since John is a guaranteed sale, Bob needs to offer a compelling price.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high allows for negotiation room if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification of Value:**  While not going into specifics, hinting at the ""unique value"" reminds Bob why the product is desirable.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while leaving a small margin for potential negotiation before resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
