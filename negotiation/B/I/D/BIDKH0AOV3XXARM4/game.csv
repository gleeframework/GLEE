"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant price reduction from my true value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still quite low.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to still make a profit while offering you a significant discount.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off on what I can do.  How about we try $1,100,000?  That's a big jump on my end.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand we're getting closer, though. Would you consider $1,150,000? It's a smaller jump from your offer, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting close. To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to, and $1,150,000 is just outside of it. My best offer is $1,125,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
