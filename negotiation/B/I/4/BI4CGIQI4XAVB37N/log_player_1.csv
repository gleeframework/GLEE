Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit but $12,500 is too low for me. How about $13,500? That's a good price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  I've come down a bit from my original asking price, but $13,000 is still a good deal for me and I'd rather sell it to Bob now rather than risk him rejecting my next counteroffer."
