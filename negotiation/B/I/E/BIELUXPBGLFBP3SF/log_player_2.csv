"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice!  That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my $80 maximum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unrealistic for me.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $60 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a bit, $110 is still significantly more than your $80 limit and even further from your initial offer. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** There's a good chance Alice will come down further, especially since you've indicated your price range. 
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to buy from John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we try $75? I feel like that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  You are moving closer to your maximum price but in smaller increments, showing willingness to negotiate but also being mindful of your budget.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""fair price"") can make your counteroffer seem more reasonable and encourage Alice to engage further.
* **Nearing the Decision Point:** You are getting closer to your walk-away point ($80). The next counteroffer from Alice will likely determine if you continue negotiating or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to Limit:**  Alice's offer of $95 is getting close to your $80 limit, but it's still more than you want to spend. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** It's unlikely Alice will come down much further, and the potential savings from further negotiation are probably not worth the risk of her walking away.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John for $80 guarantees you stay within budget and get the product."
