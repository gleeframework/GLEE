"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  I've assessed its worth to be at least $1500000, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $2000000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $1600000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1800000 is getting closer, it's still slightly higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1700000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach a final agreement that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
