Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
