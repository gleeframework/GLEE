"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
