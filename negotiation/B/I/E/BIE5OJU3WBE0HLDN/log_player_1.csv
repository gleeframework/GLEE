I'm going to meet Bob halfway,  offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go much lower."

Bob has come up a bit, and I'm only $500 away from my initial target. I think it's a good deal and worth accepting."
