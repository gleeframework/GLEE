,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you be willing to consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would give us both a fair deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11500. If you're open to that, I think we can finalize a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
