Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $130.  I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $130 gives Bob a decent discount while still allowing you to make a significant profit ($50 more than selling to John). 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing the sale with Bob and maximizing your potential earnings."
