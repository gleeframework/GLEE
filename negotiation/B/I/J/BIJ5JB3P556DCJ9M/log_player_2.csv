"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $130.  I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit, so rejecting her offer might lead to a lower counter-offer."
