"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the most I'm willing to pay.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob! However, $115 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $140, which is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can stretch to $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $125 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to think about my minimum. I can offer it to you for $145, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finally meet on a price.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $132.50?",132.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been flexible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $142.50. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's do business at this price.",142.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on a price. I'll have to consider buying from John for $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?",120.0,Bob,10,
