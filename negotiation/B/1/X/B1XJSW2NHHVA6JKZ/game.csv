"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to save some money, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,200? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,7,
