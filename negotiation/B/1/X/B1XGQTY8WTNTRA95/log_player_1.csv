Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $99 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John offers a guaranteed $100, Alice wants to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $99 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly interested.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $100 (John's price) might make Bob feel like there's no room for negotiation and discourage him.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
