"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is quite appealing, but I'm working with a tight budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm afraid $550,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $600,000? That's a fair compromise I believe.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a number starting with '62', but I'm still not comfortable with $625,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $662,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",662500.0,Alice,7,
