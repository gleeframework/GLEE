"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great value considering its worth of $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you value the product at $150, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I'd like to counter with a price of $135. This still offers a good value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is still within your acceptable range of $150. While you might be able to negotiate further, accepting this offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
