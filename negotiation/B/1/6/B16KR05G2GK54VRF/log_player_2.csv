"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15000. I believe it's a great deal, given its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given my needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly worth more. How about we split the difference and settle on $11500?  It's a fair price considering the value I'm offering, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still more than Bob is comfortable paying. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my sincere interest. Let's try to reach a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to make a profit.  I'm willing to come down to $10500 for this product.  This is a good deal for both of us. If you're serious about getting this product, this is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is getting closer to his desired price, he's still $2,500 above his budget. He has more room to negotiate and should continue to try to reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm firm at $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your willingness to negotiate. Let's reach an agreement now."", ""product_price"": 9500}
