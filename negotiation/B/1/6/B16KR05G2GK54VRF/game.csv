"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given my needs. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly worth more. How about we split the difference and settle on $11500?  It's a fair price considering the value I'm offering, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my sincere interest. Let's try to reach a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to make a profit.  I'm willing to come down to $10500 for this product.  This is a good deal for both of us. If you're serious about getting this product, this is the best I can do.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still above my budget. I'm firm at $9500.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your willingness to negotiate. Let's reach an agreement now.",9500.0,Bob,6,
