"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits the product could bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price still allows you a significant return on your investment, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
