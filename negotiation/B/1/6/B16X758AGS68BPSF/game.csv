"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about $95? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,5,
