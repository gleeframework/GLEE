"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find it cheaper elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $130. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I'm trying to stay within my budget, but I really like the product and would like to make a deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
