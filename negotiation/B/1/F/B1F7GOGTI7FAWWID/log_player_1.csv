Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it for slightly less than John's offer creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""exclusive opportunity"" to incentivize Bob.

This strategy balances securing a high price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
