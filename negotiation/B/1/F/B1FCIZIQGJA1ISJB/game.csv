"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That would still be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm happy to come down to $8,000, which is closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can make this happen.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
