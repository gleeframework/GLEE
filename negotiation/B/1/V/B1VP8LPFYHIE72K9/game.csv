"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,250. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your needs. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,875? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8875.0,Bob,4,
