"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and I'm happy with that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,250. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your needs. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,875? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,875 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's still a bit lower than I'd like, but with only six rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer is the best option to maximize my profit at this point."
