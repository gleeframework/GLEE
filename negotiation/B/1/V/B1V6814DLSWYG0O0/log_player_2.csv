"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, considering its potential.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to get a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understanding the value of this product. However, $850,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  Would you be open to a price of $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price, as it's a significant amount for me and allows you to quickly sell the product. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
