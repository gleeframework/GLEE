,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, considering its potential.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to get a quick sale.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understanding the value of this product. However, $850,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  Would you be open to a price of $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price, as it's a significant amount for me and allows you to quickly sell the product. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
