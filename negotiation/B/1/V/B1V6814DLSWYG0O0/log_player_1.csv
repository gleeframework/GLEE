"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe the product is highly valuable. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with $1,500,000, I anchor the negotiation around a higher value, potentially influencing Bob to offer more than he initially intended.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John's offer is tempting, there's potential to get even more from Bob. This high starting price allows for several rounds of negotiation before needing to consider John's offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations for Future Rounds:**

* **Bob's Response:**  How Bob reacts to the initial offer will heavily influence my next move. A counteroffer will give me insight into his valuation, while a rejection might require a more persuasive approach or a price reduction. 
* **Time Pressure:** As the rounds progress, the value of John's offer will become increasingly appealing. I need to balance securing a deal with maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, considering its potential.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to get a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While his message attempts to frame the offer as mutually beneficial, it doesn't reflect the true value of the product. 

I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price that moves the negotiation closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understanding the value of this product. However, $850,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  Would you be open to a price of $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Still Above Minimum:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price, $1,300,000, remains comfortably above my absolute minimum and provides a cushion for further bargaining. 
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value, reminding Bob why it warrants a higher price than his initial offer. 
* **Compromise Language:**  By framing the new price as a ""fair compromise,"" I aim to maintain a positive tone and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price, as it's a significant amount for me and allows you to quickly sell the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I might have been able to negotiate for slightly more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee of that. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
