"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1,050,000 to feel comfortable. How about we meet at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,075,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept it just yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a bit more than $1,025,000 to feel comfortable. How about we meet at $1,030,000?",1030000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $1,027,500.  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1027500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I think we're in the final stretch. I'm willing to meet you at $1,027,500, but I need to make a bit more than that to feel comfortable. How about we meet at $1,027,750? It's a small increase, but it's worth it to me.",1027750.0,Alice,7,
