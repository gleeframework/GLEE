"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($12,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** This price is also above Alice's value for the product ($12,000), leaving room for a potential compromise. 
* **Strategic Approach:**  Bob is aiming to secure a deal close to Alice's minimum acceptable price while still getting a good deal for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $13,800 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $13,000. 
* **Saving Money:** This deal still saves Bob $1,200 compared to buying from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away. Accepting this offer secures a good price with minimal risk."
