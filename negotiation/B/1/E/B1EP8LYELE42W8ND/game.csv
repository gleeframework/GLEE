"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",8500.0,Alice,5,
