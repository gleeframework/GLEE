Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not outrageously high.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, and if not, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum value. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and having to deal with the negotiation process again."
