Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $125. It's a fair offer considering its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $125 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Bob is unlikely to offer significantly more than $90. Accepting his offer means losing out on potential profit. It's strategically better to accept John's guaranteed offer of $100."
