"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to be the first to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's high value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a point favorable to us. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer is likely to be influenced by this initial high price.
* **Justification:** Providing a vague justification (""unique value and potential"") helps make the high price seem less arbitrary.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while allowing flexibility for negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. After careful evaluation, I believe the product's true value aligns more closely with a price closer to $1,000,000. I appreciate your perspective, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting it would result in a substantial loss.  It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. We'll counter-offer in the next round and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  This isn't just about its immediate value to you, but its potential in the right hands. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant concession and a very strong offer for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We are making a significant concession of $300,000 to show willingness to negotiate. However, we are still holding firm well above both Bob's offer and our minimum price.
* **Reiterating Value:** We are subtly shifting the focus from Bob's perceived value to a broader ""potential,"" subtly reminding him of potential resale or untapped benefits.
* **Time Pressure:** As rounds progress, a slight sense of urgency is introduced without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I still believe a more reasonable price would be around $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to finding a fair agreement that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price point, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below our $1,500,000 reserve.  We need to signal that we are willing to negotiate further but not at the cost of a substantial loss. We will counter-offer again, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle while being prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,750,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects my genuine desire to reach an agreement with you."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We are now moving closer to the midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's offer. This signals flexibility while still preserving a significant portion of our potential profit.
* **Final Offer Tone:**  The language used (""significant move,"" ""genuine desire"") implies this is a strong offer and close to our final decision point. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With half the rounds remaining,  we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics.

We are getting close to the point where we may need to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob isn't willing to meet us closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your latest offer, Alice. Considering the product's potential and the discussions we've had, I think a fair price would be around $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally met our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is the same amount John is offering, and continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Accepting this offer secures us the best possible outcome at this stage."
