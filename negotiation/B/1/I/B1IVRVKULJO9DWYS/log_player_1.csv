Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000 offer:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  The message is designed to be friendly and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room to negotiate down to a price closer to my minimum value if necessary. If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer or move on to John, ensuring a sale at my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  I need to hold out for a better price, potentially by counteroffering or, if necessary, selling to John to guarantee my minimum desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to meet you halfway. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $900,000:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting the value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Building rapport:** The language is friendly and focused on finding common ground.  

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum desired value.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to either counteroffer again or move on to John, ensuring my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  Considering the possibility of further negotiation being lengthy, and the risk of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers, it's a good time to accept this offer and secure a sale.  

Here's why:

* **Close to Minimum:**  $850,000 is significantly closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and might lead to Bob backing out or making further lower offers. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
