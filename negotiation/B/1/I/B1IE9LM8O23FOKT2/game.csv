"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its potential value. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a more fair price reflecting the product's potential value. Let's find a compromise we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1000000. That's my final offer. Can you accept that?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
