Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product ($800,000) but significantly lower than my own valuation ($1,000,000). This strategy maximizes the chances of Bob accepting the offer, while still securing a profit for me. If he rejects, I can comfortably sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
