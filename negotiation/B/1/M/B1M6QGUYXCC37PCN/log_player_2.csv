{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $11,000, which is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. However, there are only 5 rounds remaining, and Bob is still not sure if he can get Alice to come down further.  Since time is running out and Bob is worried about potentially wasting more time and effort on negotiations, he decides to buy the product from John for $12,000. While this is not ideal, it ensures Bob gets the product and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
