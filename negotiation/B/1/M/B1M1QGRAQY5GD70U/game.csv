"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $1,200,000.  Either way, I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
