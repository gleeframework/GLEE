"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 feels quite low considering the product's value. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant benefit the product will bring to my business, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000.
