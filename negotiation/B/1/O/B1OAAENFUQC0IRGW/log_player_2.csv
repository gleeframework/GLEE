"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is still too high.  It's better to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate further. He's only 5 rounds away from being able to buy from John, so there's time to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to his target price, but he's still only 5 rounds away from being able to buy from John. It's worth pushing for a lower price since he's already saved $120,000 from Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement. While $1,120,000 is closer,  I can only go up to $1,110,000.  This price represents a significant savings for me and a fair profit for you.  Let's settle this now before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,110,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is offering additional perks, Bob has only 3 rounds left. He's already saved a significant amount from the original price, but he's also very close to buying from John at his target price. The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially missing out on the better deal from John outweighs the potential benefits of the additional perks."
