Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit.  I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a good compromise.  I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal with further negotiation, and risking it to potentially get a slightly higher price might be a risk not worth taking. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice right now."
