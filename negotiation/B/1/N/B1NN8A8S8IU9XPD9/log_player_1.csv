Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to discussing further if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal, $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows for a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear we are unlikely to reach a price that satisfies both of us.  Bob's increments are relatively small, and we are still significantly below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a better outcome at this point."
