"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $900,000 falls short of what I believe the product is worth.  Would you consider $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $925,000? I think this is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about purchasing the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we both see the value in this product.  While $925,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $937,500. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $800,000.",937500.0,Bob,6,
