"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  This allows for a good profit for you and gets me closer to my target price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
