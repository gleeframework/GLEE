Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will serve you well."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John, there's a chance to get the full value from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets the anchor high. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** By offering your ""best and final"" price, you signal that you're firm on the value.

**Important Note:**  Bob might outright reject this offer knowing he values it less. However, this strategy prioritizes getting the maximum possible return."
