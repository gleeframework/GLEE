Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer.  She knows we have a budget of $100 and is trying to push us close to that limit.  While we might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's not worth the risk of losing out on the guaranteed $100 deal from John."
