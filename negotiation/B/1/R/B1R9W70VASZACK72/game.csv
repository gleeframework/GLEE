"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand it's a significant investment, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential value. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. Can you consider it?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to move slightly closer to your offer, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $975000? It's a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",975000.0,Alice,5,
