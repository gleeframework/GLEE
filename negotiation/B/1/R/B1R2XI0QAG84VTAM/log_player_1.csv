{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to counteroffer rather than outright reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it for that price immediately.  I believe the product is worth more, and Bob's initial counteroffer suggests he might be willing to pay more. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great value for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John is offering and gets us both closer to a deal. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
