Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not too aggressive, so it doesn't risk alienating Bob from the negotiation. 

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** I can try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000.  This provides a safety net and gives me leverage in negotiations.

I will proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:**  $9,500 is a significant increase from Bob's offer of $8,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:**  While $9,500 is above Bob's initial valuation, it's still lower than what he'd pay if he had to buy from someone else.
* **It shows I'm flexible:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum price. 

I'll continue to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to meet your price at $9,500. I would like to stick to my budget of $8,000. Let me know if this is feasible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful:** Bob has been insistent on his budget, and there's little room for compromise.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoid further negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John offers a certain outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
