"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
