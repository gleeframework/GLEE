"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which would be a good deal for both of us.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
