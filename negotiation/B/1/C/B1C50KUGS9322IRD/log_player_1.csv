Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $950,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" are used to encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000."
