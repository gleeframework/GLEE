"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, you're willing to pay up to $80. By starting at $60, you have a $20 buffer for potential counteroffers from Alice.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite but clearly conveys that the initial offer is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $120 is significantly more than your $80 limit and leaves little room for further negotiation if Alice is anchored to the idea of ""meeting in the middle"". 
* **John is an Option:** You have a reliable alternative with John, so there's no pressure to settle for a price that's not comfortable. 
* ** Aim for a Counteroffer:** By rejecting this offer, you encourage Alice to potentially come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I had budgeted for this item. Would you consider $75? I feel that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate and move closer to Alice's price range.
* **Within Budget:** The $75 offer keeps you within your $80 budget, ensuring you don't overspend.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help you gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower the price.  If she rejects it outright, you can consider moving closer to $80, or accepting John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $120. How about $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's latest offer of $97.50 is still significantly higher than your $80 budget. 
* **Unlikely to Budge:** Her insistence on ""meeting in the middle"" suggests she's unlikely to come down much further. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $80, saving you over $17 and avoiding further negotiation hassle."
