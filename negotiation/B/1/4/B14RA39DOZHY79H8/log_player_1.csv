Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000.

By offering the product at $11,000, Alice aims to secure a significant profit while still leaving a margin for potential negotiation with Bob."
