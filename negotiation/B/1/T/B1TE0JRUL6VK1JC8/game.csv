"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's something that can greatly benefit your business, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000, but this is a significant compromise on my end. This product offers real value, and I believe it's worth the investment. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my final offer before I consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
