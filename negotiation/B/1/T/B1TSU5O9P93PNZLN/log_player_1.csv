```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By starting with a price closer to my minimum, I maximize my potential earnings. I'm also conveying my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  John's offer serves as my safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial rejection, there's still room for me to negotiate a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to be patient. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** John's offer remains a secure alternative.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming to find a compromise."
