"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and the potential we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This offer reflects the product's value and allows you to get a great deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",10800.0,Bob,6,
