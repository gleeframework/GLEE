"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  If you're serious about selling, let's see if we can make this work. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $980,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're serious about buying, I think this is a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is still just a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing my limits here, but I'm willing to go up to $970,000. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at that price.  It's the best I can do. What do you think?",970000.0,Bob,6,
