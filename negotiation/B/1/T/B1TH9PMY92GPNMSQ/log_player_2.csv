# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $990,000 is still over his budget, and it's likely that if he rejects it, Alice will not come down further. John is offering the product at his maximum price, so it's the best option to get the product at a price he's comfortable with."
