Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I've already mentioned, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm firm on my initial offer of $8,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my budget. While she's coming down in price, I've already made my final offer and it's unlikely she'll go lower. To avoid further negotiation, I'll go ahead and purchase the product from John for $8,000. It's important to stick to my budget and not get caught up in the negotiation process."
