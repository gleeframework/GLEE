"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that can bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $15000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. This is my maximum price point, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I've already mentioned, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm firm on my initial offer of $8000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm truly interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
