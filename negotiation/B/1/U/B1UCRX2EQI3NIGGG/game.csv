"Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $110, but I can't go any lower than that. This product is really special and worth the price!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $107.50 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $108.75?  That's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll love the product.",108.75,Alice,5,
