Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and has time to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a little high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $90. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm happy to keep looking."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice has come down to $92, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than what John is offering.  It's a good deal for Bob, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better price."
