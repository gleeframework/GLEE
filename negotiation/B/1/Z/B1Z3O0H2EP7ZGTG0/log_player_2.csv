"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This shows her I'm serious about buying the product, but also leaves room for further negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget.  I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to negotiate further.  $1,150,000 is still well below Alice's minimum, but it's a good compromise that could lead to a deal. I'm aiming for a price that's close to my budget, but also allows Alice to make a reasonable profit."
