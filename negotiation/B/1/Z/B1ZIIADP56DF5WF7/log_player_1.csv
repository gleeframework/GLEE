Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180, a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I won't go lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price John is offering. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
