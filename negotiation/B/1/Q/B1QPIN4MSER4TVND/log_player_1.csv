Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is slightly below the product's worth to you ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's valuation ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's perceived personality, you might adjust the price and message. 
* Be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price point that's acceptable to you. You have a strong fallback option with John."
