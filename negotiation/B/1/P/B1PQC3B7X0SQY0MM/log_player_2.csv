# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $9,000, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above what he can get from John. He can keep trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $10,200 is still higher than what John is selling it for, and Bob has already made multiple counteroffers. It's unlikely Alice will budge further.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at the lowest possible price."
