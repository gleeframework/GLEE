"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $9,000, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I can go.",10200.0,Alice,5,
