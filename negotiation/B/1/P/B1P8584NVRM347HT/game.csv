"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and the potential savings for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  I'm committed to making this deal work.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
