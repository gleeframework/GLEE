"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and the potential savings for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price.  Bob is still willing to pay more than John's price, so there's incentive to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  I'm committed to making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,250, which is still higher than Bob's desired price and closer to Alice's original asking price.  Bob has limited rounds remaining, and it's becoming more likely that Alice will not go lower. With John offering the product for $10,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
