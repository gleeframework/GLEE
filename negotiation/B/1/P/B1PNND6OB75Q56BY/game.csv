"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While your offer is understandable, it doesn't fully reflect the unique benefits and potential it holds. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,550,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for you. To be fair, I could consider $1,750,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal through.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,750,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which I believe is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate you coming up to $1,600,000, and I'm willing to meet you partway.  However, I have other interested parties, and realistically, $1,700,000 is the lowest I can go. I believe that's more than fair considering the value this product brings. Let me know your thoughts; I'd like to finalize this soon.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to stay within my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,8,
