"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price given the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer ready to purchase at my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $1,250,000.
* You can get the same product from John for $1,200,000.

Therefore, it makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
