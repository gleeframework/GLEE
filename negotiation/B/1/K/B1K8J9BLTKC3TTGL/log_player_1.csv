"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. My starting price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still leaving me with a good profit.  I'm also framing the message to be friendly and engaging, hoping to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is a good deal, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I think that's a fair compromise 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $132 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and offers a reasonable profit.  I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away altogether, and I might end up having to sell to John for a lower price."
