"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a high profit. I'm willing to negotiate down from this point, but I want to see Bob's reaction first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a decent profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,500. This is a good compromise. I'm getting closer to my desired profit margin, and it's a much better deal than selling to John for $15,000.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is too high at this point.  There's a good chance Bob could walk away, and I would be left with only John's offer."
