"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe it's a bit high, considering I've done some research and seen similar products selling for lower prices. Can we meet in the middle at $975000?",975000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $975000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $998000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",998000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $998000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $998000. Can we try $991500?",991500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $991500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $996000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's unique features. What do you think?",996000.0,Alice,5,
