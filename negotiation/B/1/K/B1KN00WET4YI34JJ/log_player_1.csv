Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a bold move, but it allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in buying and how much he's willing to compromise.  If he rejects, I'll reassess and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject and make a counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my goal of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer. While selling to John is tempting, I'm not sure how much time this negotiation will take and if I can find another buyer in that time. I'm willing to risk it for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping the price to $1,450,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. Bob has shown he's not willing to go much higher, and I'm still getting a good price for the product. I'm hoping this will convince him to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have gone on for a while, and Bob's offers are getting frustratingly low.  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not convinced Bob will budge much further. At this point, I'm  better off selling to John for $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed sale and  a much better deal than accepting Bob's current offer."
