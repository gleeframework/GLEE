Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can do $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,500 and we have a guaranteed option for $8,000 with John.  We've negotiated a good discount, but John's offer is our best bet at this point."
