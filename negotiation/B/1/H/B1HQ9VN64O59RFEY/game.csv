"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my best and final offer for now.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? This is my final offer before I consider other buyers.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $940,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept at this point. Let's finalize this deal now, and I'll even throw in a complimentary bonus for you to sweeten the deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $940,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $940,000, which is $930,000. That's my final offer.",930000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $930,000 just isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference? $935,000, and we can close this deal right now.  Remember, this product is worth significantly more to you, and this is your last chance to acquire it at this price.",935000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Bob,8,
