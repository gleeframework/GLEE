"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's close this deal quickly!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a strong starting point. It's high enough to ensure a good profit for me, but low enough to be enticing to Bob, who values the product at $1,200,000. I've also included a positive message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my best and final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm confident I can do better. Bob has shown interest and his counteroffer is a clear indication he wants to acquire the product. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? This is my final offer before I consider other buyers."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $920,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still within my negotiation window and confident I can push for a better deal. I'm also aware that Bob is motivated to buy the product, so I have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $940,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept at this point. Let's finalize this deal now, and I'll even throw in a complimentary bonus for you to sweeten the deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the bonus, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $940,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $940,000, which is $930,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $930,000 is close to my desired price point, I'm going to push for a better deal. I've already established a good rapport with Bob and he seems willing to negotiate further. I'm still within my 10 rounds and I have some leverage, so I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to $940,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $930,000 just isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference? $935,000, and we can close this deal right now.  Remember, this product is worth significantly more to you, and this is your last chance to acquire it at this price."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the last few rounds and Bob's offer is only $25,000 more than what John is offering.  There's a good chance Bob will continue to push for a lower price and I'm not confident I can get him to agree to $935,000.  At this point, I'm better off taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
