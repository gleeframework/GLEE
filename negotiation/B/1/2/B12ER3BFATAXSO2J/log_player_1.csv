Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $80, which is your absolute minimum. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price leaves room for both of you to negotiate without feeling like you're giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your goal of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal, and I'll be able to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110}
