"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better deal than $150, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal, and I'll be able to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $110 is significantly cheaper than $150. 
* **It's likely the best Bob can get:** Alice already rejected a lower offer, and further negotiation might risk her walking away completely. 

Bob can secure the product for a price he's comfortable with while still saving money compared to John."
