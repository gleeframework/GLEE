"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. However, I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is way above your budget of $800,000. It's not even close to your maximum price of $800,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still recognizing your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,700,000, it's still above my budget and my maximum willingness to pay. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
