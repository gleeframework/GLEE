"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,150,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That's a significant increase from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,125,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid $1,125,000 is still pushing my budget.  To be completely transparent, I can get the product elsewhere for $1,200,000. However, I value our negotiation and believe we can still make a deal. I'm prepared to offer you $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
