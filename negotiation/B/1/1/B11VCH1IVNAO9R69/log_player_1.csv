Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I need to close a deal,  $1,000,000 is too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,150,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That's a significant increase from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,075,000 is a better offer than before, it's still not enough. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,125,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid $1,125,000 is still pushing my budget.  To be completely transparent, I can get the product elsewhere for $1,200,000. However, I value our negotiation and believe we can still make a deal. I'm prepared to offer you $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now openly stating he can get the product elsewhere for $1,200,000, meaning further negotiation likely won't yield a better price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
