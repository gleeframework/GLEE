"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is a high-quality item that I believe will meet your needs perfectly. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no immediate benefit to accepting it.  You can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. Since John is offering the product for the same price, you have the flexibility to negotiate with Alice without losing out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality you're offering, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider a compromise at $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's offer of $120. Accepting this offer saves you $10. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
