"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation and give the impression the product might be worth even more to Bob.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy. His response will indicate whether he's willing to engage in serious negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** I haven't revealed my guaranteed offer from John. This knowledge gives me the power to walk away if negotiations with Bob aren't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I'm prepared to offer $600,000. It's a fair starting point, considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. While his counter-offer was aggressive, it shows he's interested. I need to counter in a way that keeps him engaged but moves towards a more reasonable price point.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's find a more realistic middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price reflects the value and potential this product holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer ($400,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously. 
* **Still Above Valuation:**  This counteroffer is still comfortably above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price, preserving room for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to remind Bob of its potential benefits, justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I can offer you $750,000.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slowly increasing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, and I'll use the next round to make a more strategic counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this deal. Let's bridge the gap. To show my commitment, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm moving directly to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This creates a sense of urgency and signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal now.
* **Justification:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and highlighting its fairness, reinforcing the idea that it's a take-it-or-leave-it situation.
* **John in the Wings:**  Bob is unaware that I have a guaranteed offer from John. There's a chance he might walk away, but I'm willing to take that risk to secure a deal that meets my needs."
