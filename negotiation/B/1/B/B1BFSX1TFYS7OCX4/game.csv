"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I'm prepared to offer $600,000. It's a fair starting point, considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's find a more realistic middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price reflects the value and potential this product holds for your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I can offer you $750,000.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this deal. Let's bridge the gap. To show my commitment, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
