"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $125, while John is selling it for $150. 
* **The price is within your budget:** You are willing to spend up to $150, so $125 is within your limit. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $25 compared to buying from John."
