"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and it's certainly worth that much to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to me. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that. However, $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value I know this product holds. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, as it's still a significant discount from your original price. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $950,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still not able to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would be a fair price considering the value you have placed on the product yourself. If you're still interested, let me know.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
