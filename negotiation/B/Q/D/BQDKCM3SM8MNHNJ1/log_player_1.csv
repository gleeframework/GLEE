{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price of $150 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for that low of a price.  I'll send a counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob, his offer of $100 is still below my minimum price of $150. It's not worth continuing the negotiation further. I'll accept John's offer and sell him the product for $150."
