# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1200000, which is $1075000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still slightly higher than what you're willing to pay. You have already spent 4 rounds negotiating and are getting close to your budget. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000. You save time and money by doing so."
