"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1200000, which is $1075000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
