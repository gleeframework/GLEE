Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $14,000.  While the product is worth more to her, it's better for Bob to secure the $10,000 deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
