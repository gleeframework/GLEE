"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. While $12,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
