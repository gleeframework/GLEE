"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  You can do better than $900,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value to me, $850,000 seems like a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  You're still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $950,000. There's still room for negotiation to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer. While he could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Buying from John at $1,200,000 would be significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's offer for $925,000."
