"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  You're aiming for a price closer to your $800,000 limit, and there's no reason to accept this offer in the first round.  It's better to start negotiating and see if you can bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for compromise.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, creating a basis for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, you're still well above your budget and you have room to negotiate further.  It's worth seeing if you can bring the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while remaining within Bob's budget. It shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still well above Bob's desired range. It's worth pushing for a lower price. There's still time to negotiate and try to close the deal closer to Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair offer, considering its value to me.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price, but it's starting to get close to Bob's budget.  This offer is a strong compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. It might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm now offering the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation isn't progressing as quickly as Bob would like. Alice is still holding out for a price significantly higher than Bob's target.  With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that a deal won't be reached.  To avoid risking a failed negotiation and potentially missing out on a good deal, Bob should go ahead and buy the product from John for $800,000. It's a safe and guaranteed option that aligns with Bob's budget and ensures he gets the product."
