"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
