Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Offering it to Bob directly at a slight discount might be more appealing to him than risking missing out if Alice goes to John. This introduces an element of scarcity and speed. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  There are other valid strategies, and the ""best"" offer depends on factors like your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
