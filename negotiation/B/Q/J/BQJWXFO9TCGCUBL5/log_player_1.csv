Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This gives us some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and direct in my message, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I can likely get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down to $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That seems like a fair compromise considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for a bit higher,  $9,500 is a good price and getting closer to my target.  It's also more than the $8,000 I could get from John.  Accepting Bob's offer seems like the best choice at this point."
