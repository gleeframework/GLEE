"I've already made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to what I'm looking for. I'm now offering $1075000 is too high, I'll go back to my previous offer of $1050000 is too low, I'll meet you in the middle of my previous offers. I'm now offering $1012500 for the product.",1012500.0,Alice,9,
