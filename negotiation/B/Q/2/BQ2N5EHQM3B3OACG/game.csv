"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing with your product. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to accept $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12000? I believe this would still allow both of us to benefit from the transaction.",12000.0,Bob,2,
