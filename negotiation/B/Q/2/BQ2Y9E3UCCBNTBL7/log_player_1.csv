"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to assess Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you consider the product's true value. You have 8 rounds left and can potentially get closer to your desired price. You also have the backup of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $950,000 is still below the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a slight concession to demonstrate flexibility while still staying closer to my minimum. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and puts pressure on Bob to potentially meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I cannot agree to $975,000. My maximum budget remains at $950,000. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been insistent on his $950,000 offer, demonstrating a lack of willingness to move further.  We've reached round 4, with 6 rounds remaining.  While there's a chance Bob might budge, the risk of a prolonged negotiation and potentially ending up with less than my minimum is too high.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
