"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a great value and I believe you'll really benefit from it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. While $14,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a good price for both of us, as it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
