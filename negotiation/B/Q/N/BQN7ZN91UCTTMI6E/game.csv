"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $900000. It's significantly below its true value and the benefits it can bring to your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1050000. This price reflects a compromise and allows us to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
