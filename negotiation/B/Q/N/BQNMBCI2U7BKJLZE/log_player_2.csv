{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer and has made it clear she's unlikely to go much lower.  While $8,200 isn't a terrible price, we're running out of rounds, and she's likely to keep pushing for a price above $8,000.  It's less risky at this point to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed $10,000 offer."
