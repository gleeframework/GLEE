{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear expectation that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. There's no point in trying to negotiate further, as I risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at the same price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product while staying within my financial limit."
