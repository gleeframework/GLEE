Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget without jeopardizing my minimum value.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident in the product's worth and won't settle for anything less than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still lower than my initial price. I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still being above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly closer to my desired price point, and it's above my minimum value. I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal."
