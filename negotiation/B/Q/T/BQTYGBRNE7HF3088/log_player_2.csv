"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($900,000) is less than your maximum budget ($1,200,000).**
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.** 

Even though you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Accepting her current offer secures the product within your budget and with significant savings."
