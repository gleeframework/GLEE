Bob has been trying to negotiate a better price with Alice, but she's not budging much. At this point, Alice's offer is only $1,000 lower than what John is offering, and it's not clear if Alice will come down further.  Bob decides to cut his losses and buy the product from John, who is offering a guaranteed price that's within Bob's budget."
