"I understand you're interested in the product, but $100 is a bit low for me. I can do $140, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit far off from $140. Can you think about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,130.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $132, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'll do $129, and that's my final offer.",129.0,Bob,10,
