"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me some wiggle room and also signals that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$100 is below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130.  This is still higher than my minimum, but lower than my original offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
