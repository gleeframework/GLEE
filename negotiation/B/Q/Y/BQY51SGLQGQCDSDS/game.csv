"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go above $1000000. I'm making a final counteroffer of $1000000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
