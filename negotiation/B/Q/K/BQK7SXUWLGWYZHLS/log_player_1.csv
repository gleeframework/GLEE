Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a good price from Bob. I'll be willing to negotiate down if he counters, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I can't accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still above my minimum, but it's a bit closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so I'll accept it.  While I'd prefer to make more, it's better to secure the sale than risk getting nothing."
