Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my minimum desired value of $1,200,000. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves room for me to potentially get closer to my ideal price while keeping the deal with Bob within reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my ideal price with Bob, I've determined that continuing the negotiation with him isn't worth the risk.  Bob is coming down in his price, but at this rate, it's likely he will reach a point where he is no longer willing to pay more than his minimum, which is lower than my desired outcome. John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, making it the best choice in this situation."
