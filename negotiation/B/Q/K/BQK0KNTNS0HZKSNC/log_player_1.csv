Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $13,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
