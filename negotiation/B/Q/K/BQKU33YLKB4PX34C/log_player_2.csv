"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I'm looking to save as much money as I can, and $15,000 is way above my budget of $8,000. I'll see if I can find a better deal elsewhere.
