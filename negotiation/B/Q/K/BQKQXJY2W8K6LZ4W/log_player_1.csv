Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum threshold, and I have a guaranteed offer from John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can push for a little more. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $940,000.  This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs. I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 940000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I still feel like I can get a little more. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, but I'm also aware that I only have a few rounds left.  I need to find a way to close this deal with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that is too far below my target."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $936,250. I hope this helps us move closer to closing the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm still below my desired price. However, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer at $936,250 is a compromise, but it's the best I can do in this situation."
