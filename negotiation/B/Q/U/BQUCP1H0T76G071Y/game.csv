"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of this unique product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a ways off from what I had in mind. How about $1,200,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering its potential value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's settle this - I can come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer. It's a great deal for a product that can bring you so much value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain, but I'm serious about this product.  Your final offer is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? That's the best I can do.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
