"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I can't go as low as $8000, but I'm willing to come down to $12000. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow me to purchase the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
