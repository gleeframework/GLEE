"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you've highlighted.",875000.0,Bob,4,
