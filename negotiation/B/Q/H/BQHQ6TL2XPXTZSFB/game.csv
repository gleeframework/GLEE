"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you at $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875,000.
