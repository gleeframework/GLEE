"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $95?  Let's make this happen!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to meet you at $98. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $98 is just a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $92. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",92.0,Alice,7,
