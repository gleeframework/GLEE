"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more substantial discount. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to negotiations, but I'd like to explore this price point further.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to achieve my target while offering you a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to explore this price point further.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $812,500. This price is closer to your last offer and still ensures a profitable deal for me. This is my final offer before I explore other options.  Let's close this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but I think $800,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
