Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than that. This is as close to my minimum price as I can go. What do you think?

Alice is firm on $13,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, you are getting closer to your maximum budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $10,000, which is within your budget and saves you money."
