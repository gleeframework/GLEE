Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** While not explicitly stated, hinting that you'll list it publicly (and potentially get a better offer) creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to decide. 
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is crucial.  Keeping it polite and open-ended (""What do you think?"") encourages a response and further discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the door open for negotiation. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always come down in price, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
