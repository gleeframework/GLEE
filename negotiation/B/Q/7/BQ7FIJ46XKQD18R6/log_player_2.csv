"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's not worth it to buy from Alice at that price.  Bob should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a compromise, Bob is still better off sticking to his initial counteroffer of $10,000 or buying from John.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $10,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $10,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's desired price of $10,000.  Given that Bob can get the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
