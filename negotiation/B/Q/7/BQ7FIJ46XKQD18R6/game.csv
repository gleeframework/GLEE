"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $10,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $10,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000.",12500.0,Alice,5,
