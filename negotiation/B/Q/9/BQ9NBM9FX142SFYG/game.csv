Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $15000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $15000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13500. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $14000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one final offer, but I'm afraid $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13500, but I'm not willing to go any higher. If I don't get this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000",13500.0,Bob,6,
