Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $10,000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit low. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a significant compromise on my end."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to my price, he is doing so very slowly. It's unlikely he will reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. It's more strategic at this point to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
