"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $10,000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit low. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can we meet there?",9500.0,Bob,6,
