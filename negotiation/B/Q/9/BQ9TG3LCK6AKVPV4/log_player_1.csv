Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. If he accepts immediately, you've made a great deal. If he rejects, you can always lower the price, knowing you have John as a backup buyer. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $120 is a nice, round number that might seem more appealing than, say, $117.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit, but be reasonable to avoid losing the sale to John."
