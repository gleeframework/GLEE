Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price even higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Simply stating a high number isn't enough. By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment,"" we're framing the offer in a way that emphasizes value to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone is important.  By ending with ""What do you think?"", we're inviting Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed offer. If Bob knew about John, our negotiating position would be much weaker."
