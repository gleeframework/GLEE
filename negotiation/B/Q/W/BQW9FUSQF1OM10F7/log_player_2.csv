Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $8,000 either. I can meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. There's no reason to pay more, even if it's only $500 more.  He should counteroffer again and try to get a better price from Alice."
