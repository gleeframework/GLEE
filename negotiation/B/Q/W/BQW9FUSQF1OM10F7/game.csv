"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $8,000 either. I can meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a little higher than I'm willing to go. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",8000.0,Bob,4,
