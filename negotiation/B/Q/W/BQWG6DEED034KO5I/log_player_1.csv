Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for $11,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than I had hoped for, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I'm not willing to accept his offer of $10,500, as it's still a bit too low.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll offer the product to Bob for $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $10,500, I'll try to get a bit closer to that, but still a bit higher. I'll offer the product to Bob for $11,000.
