"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  That's still a good profit for you, and a fair price for me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm confident that the product's value to you is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we could finalize the sale.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which is $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
