"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  That's still a good profit for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm confident that the product's value to you is worth a bit more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but $13,000 is still more than Bob is comfortable with.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price.  He's not in a rush, so he can keep playing the negotiation game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we could finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which is $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  While $12,500 is still more than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's getting closer to his acceptable range.
* **Alice's message implies this is her final offer.**  Bob might not get a lower price if he continues to reject and counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a worse option.**  $12,500 from Alice is a significantly better deal than $15,000 from John.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob. It secures a good deal without risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or no deal."
