Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it,  given my budget constraints.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident that this product will generate substantial returns for you.  Would you consider $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's clear he's not likely to reach my minimum price quickly.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a better outcome than further negotiation with Bob is likely to bring."
