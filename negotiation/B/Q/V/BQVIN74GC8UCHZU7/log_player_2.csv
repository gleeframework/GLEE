"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice will accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $850,000?  That's still a good profit for you, and a significant saving for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000?  This still leaves you with a substantial saving and keeps the deal worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $900,000. While it's better than buying from John, there's still a potential to get a better deal. Bob can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired $850,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This gives you a strong profit and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $890,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you compared to buying from John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely and being forced to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John."
