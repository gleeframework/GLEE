"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000?  This still leaves you with a substantial saving and keeps the deal worthwhile for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This gives you a strong profit and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John.",875000.0,Bob,4,
