"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

 Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about buying the product but need a price closer to your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice meeting you halfway at $85 is a good deal. It's cheaper than her initial offer and only slightly above what John is offering. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price."
