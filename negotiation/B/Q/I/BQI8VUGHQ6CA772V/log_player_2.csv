"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its value to you, and I'll be getting a price that's well above my minimum. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation.  While it's lower than your maximum budget, you know her minimum is $800,000.  There's a good chance you can get a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows interest:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Offers a significant decrease:**  The $200,000 drop signals that you're serious about getting a better price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It doesn't go too low, allowing for further back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000.  This price still gives you a significant discount and is closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her counteroffer shows movement towards a more agreeable price. However, there's still a potential for further savings. It's worth making one more counteroffer before considering John's less appealing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Continues the negotiation:** It keeps the conversation moving forward in a positive way.
* **Shows flexibility:** While still aiming for a lower price, it demonstrates willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and your previous one. 
* **Presents a strong position:** This offer puts you within a reasonable range of Alice's likely minimum, increasing the chances of acceptance while still securing a significant discount."
