"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and I can make a profit.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but I'm trying to keep my budget under $12,000. Would you be willing to go down to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference on our last offers.  I'll take $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit and gives you a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
