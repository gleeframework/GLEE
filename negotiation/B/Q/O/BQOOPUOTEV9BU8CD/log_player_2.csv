"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.**  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price. 
* **It's worthwhile to explore counteroffers.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.** $105 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still shows you're serious about buying.
* **Be polite and respectful.**  Maintaining a positive tone can encourage Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Give Alice a chance to accept.** This counteroffer doesn't immediately go to John, leaving room for a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for a product of this quality. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** While it's a lower price, you're still paying more than you'd like.
* **There's still potential to negotiate further.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, which suggests you could get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer. 
* **You have time to continue negotiating.** There are still 7 rounds remaining, so it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. If you're open to that, I'm ready to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 108} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly.**  You're now just $2 away from Alice's price, showing your seriousness while staying within your budget.
* **Add a sense of urgency.** Mentioning finalizing the deal puts some pressure on Alice to make a decision. 
* **Stay within your comfort zone.**  $108 is still a good price for you, while leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
