{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'll be ready to adjust if necessary, but I'm confident that $14,000 is a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I can do better. I'll counter with a slightly lower price but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with your new offer. I can do $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a great product, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, and I'm not sure he's going to go higher. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a risk he'll walk away and I'll end up with nothing. Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is my minimum and allows me to move on."
