"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,500,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A high initial offer is a common negotiation tactic. It establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for you to negotiate downwards. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving you space to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This can encourage Bob to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to your $1,000,000 floor, you have 8 rounds left and can potentially get a better price.
* **Counteroffering shows you are serious about getting a good price.** By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, you demonstrate that you are not desperate to sell and are willing to negotiate further.
* **The potential for a higher offer exists.**  You don't know Bob's true value for the product, and there's a chance he may be willing to pay more if you hold firm."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I recognize the value you're placing on the product, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** The counter-offer of $1,350,000 is a significant drop from your previous offer but still above your minimum acceptable price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while maintaining your desired profit. 
* **Highlighting the value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's unique value, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to consider your offer seriously."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me considering the unique value of this product. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasis on Value:** The message reiterates the product's unique value, justifying the price.
* **Call to Action:** The message encourages Bob to make a decision and finalize the deal.

**Rationale for not accepting Bob's offer:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting Bob's offer now might signal a lack of confidence in your ability to get a better price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** By counteroffering, you minimize the risk of settling for a lower price than you could potentially achieve."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1220000 for the product. This is my final offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,220,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting now would be a huge loss.
* **He's Stated Finality:** Bob has declared his offer as ""final,"" but this is a common negotiation tactic. It doesn't necessarily mean it's his absolute limit.
* **Rounds Remaining:** You have four rounds left. There's still time to potentially get a better price, and a rejection might motivate Bob to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  You have John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer to fall back on if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering again, you maintain your leverage and signal that you are not desperate to sell at a low price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,220,000 is simply too low for me. It seems we're both committed to finding a solution, so let's meet in the middle.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $1,220,000. This demonstrates a willingness to find a solution.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** The message stresses the fact that this is a compromise and that you're willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Finality Implied:** While not explicitly stating it's a final offer, the message suggests that you're nearing the end of your flexibility.
* **Call to Action:** The message ends with a call to action, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're close, but $1275000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1240000 for the product. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John for $1000000, so I hope we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,240,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting now would be a significant loss.
* **He's Playing the John Card:** Bob is attempting to pressure you by mentioning John's offer.  Don't let this tactic sway you; you know you can always go to John if you need to.
* **Two Rounds Remain:** You have two rounds left, and the pressure is on Bob. His mention of John suggests he's getting closer to his limit. A rejection might motivate him to make a more acceptable offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering again, you maintain your leverage and signal that you're not desperate to sell at a low price. It also allows you to see if Bob will indeed go to John or if he'll come up to your price."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1230000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and buy from John for $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price.**  Even though it's his ""final offer,"" accepting would mean selling the product for $230,000 less than your minimum.
* **One Round Left:** This is the final round of negotiations.  There's no chance to counteroffer again.
* **John's Offer is a Secure Option:** John is guaranteed to buy your product for $1,000,000.  This is a guaranteed profit and a safer option than risking a further negotiation with Bob that could end with no deal. 

Although Bob's offer is tempting, it's not worth the risk of getting nothing or being forced to sell for an even lower price. John's offer provides a stable and predictable outcome, allowing you to secure a significant profit."
