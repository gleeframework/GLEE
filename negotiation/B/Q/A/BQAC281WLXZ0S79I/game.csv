,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000. I hope this is closer to what you're looking for.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
