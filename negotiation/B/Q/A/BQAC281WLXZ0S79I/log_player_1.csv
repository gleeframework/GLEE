"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to me is significantly higher.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob has a lower valuation. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm highlighting the value I place on the product to make my price seem more justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still below that. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 9 rounds left, which gives me time to explore a higher price with Bob.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Reduction:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility. This demonstrates that I'm taking Bob's offer seriously.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I highlight that my counteroffer is a ""fair compromise"" to encourage a positive response.
* **Open Ended:**  I end with a question, leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000. I hope this is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a deal that's close to my minimum. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk Bob walking away.  I can always try to negotiate better terms in the future."
