Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value and what I am willing to invest. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than the guaranteed $800,000 from John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I have 8 rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am comfortable with paying $875,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still within range of my target price and have 6 rounds left. There's potential for Bob to increase his offer or for me to push him a bit further. Selling to John would lock me into a lower price, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product to you for $887,500. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 887500}
