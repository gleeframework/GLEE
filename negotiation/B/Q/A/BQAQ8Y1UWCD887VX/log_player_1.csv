Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This gives us both some room to negotiate and ensures a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer. This is the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, and it meets my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price is not worth it."
