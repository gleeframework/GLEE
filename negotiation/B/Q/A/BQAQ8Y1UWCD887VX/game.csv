"Hi Alice,  $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This gives us both some room to negotiate and ensures a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,
