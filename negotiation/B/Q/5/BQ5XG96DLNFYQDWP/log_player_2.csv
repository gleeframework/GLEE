"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than Alice's asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring the negotiation further to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still lower than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, especially since she's already lowered her price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $13,500 is still above my limit.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's settle on $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his budget, but still has room for negotiation.  It's worth one more round to see if Alice will come down to $12,500. If she doesn't, buying from John is the next best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However,  $12,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go one last time to $13,250. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. If you're serious about getting this product, this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer multiple times and his counteroffer was also rejected.  Alice's final offer of $13,250 is still above Bob's budget.  While negotiating for a lower price is always an option, Bob has already had several rounds of negotiations and it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $13,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation.  This ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and saves time and effort."
