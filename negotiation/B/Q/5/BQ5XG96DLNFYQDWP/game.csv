"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is my best offer.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still lower than my initial offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $13,500 is still above my limit.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's settle on $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However,  $12,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go one last time to $13,250. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. If you're serious about getting this product, this is my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,7,
