"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $12,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,250. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your frustration, and I'm also ready to close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13,400.  That's just a little bit more than your last offer, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's call it a day and get this done!",13400.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $13,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",13200.0,Bob,8,
