{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I can still try to negotiate a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While I prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  It's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize ""a reasonable profit"" to remind Bob that the product has value to me. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** My message is positive and invites Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below it.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a safe and profitable outcome.

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum, it's best to take the sure thing and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
