"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way too high ($150). It's much higher than your maximum budget ($100) and even higher than Alice's own valuation ($120). You should definitely counter-offer with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too expensive for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting low:**  This counteroffer anchors the negotiation much closer to your desired price range. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it shows you're serious about buying but not at an inflated price.
* **Leaving room to negotiate:**  Offering $80 leaves you space to negotiate upwards towards your $100 limit if needed. 
* **Alternative in mind:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $120 is still too high for you. It's above your maximum budget of $100.  You have room to negotiate further, especially since you have the option of buying from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer sets your maximum budget ($100) as the price. This shows Alice you're serious while being upfront about your limit. 
* **Last chance:** By phrasing it as ""the highest I can go,"" you signal that this is likely your final offer before considering John's offer.
* **Potential win-win:** Alice might accept $100, which is a profit for her (since the product is worth $120 to her) and within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at that price, and I'm not willing to give it away. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not negotiating in good faith. She increased her price from $120 to $130, which is a bad sign. It's clear she's trying to see how much she can get away with, and you've already stated your maximum budget.  

It's time to walk away and buy from John for $100. This ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
