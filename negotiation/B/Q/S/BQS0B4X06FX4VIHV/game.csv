"Hello Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too expensive for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at that price, and I'm not willing to give it away. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",130.0,Alice,5,
