Alice should reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what she believes the product is worth.  She should continue negotiating with Bob to try and secure a higher price."

Alice should reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to what she'd be willing to accept, it's still lower than her last offer.  She should continue negotiating, but she should be mindful of the risk that Bob may walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice is lowering her price slightly, recognizing that Bob might be getting closer to his limit. However, she's still holding firm, trying to get as close to her desired price as possible. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without making a drastic concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice should accept Bob's offer. Although it's less than what she originally hoped for, it's still a good deal for her, exceeding John's offer by a significant margin. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing Bob as a buyer and being forced to sell to John. This offer is a good compromise that allows Alice to secure a profitable sale."
