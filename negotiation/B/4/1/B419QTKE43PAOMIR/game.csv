"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and drop my price to $155. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's very close to my minimum. Let's close this deal!",155.0,Alice,5,
