Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $140 is more than John's offer, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below $150. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and drop my price to $155. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's very close to my minimum. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 155}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $152 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is just above John's offer, it's still a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
