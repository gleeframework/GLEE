Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $120.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price yet. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. Hopefully, he'll see the value in this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us and I'm happy to accept it."
