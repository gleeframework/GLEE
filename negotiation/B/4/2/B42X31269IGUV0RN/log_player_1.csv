"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but not too high to scare Bob off immediately.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I could try for more, there's a chance he'll walk away and I'll be stuck with the $120 from John.  I'll take the $115 and move on."
