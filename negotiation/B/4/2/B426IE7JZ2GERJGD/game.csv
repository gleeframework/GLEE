"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product,  $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're open to that price, we can finalize the deal. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I've already told you, Bob, that I won't sell the product for less than $825000. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'll come down to $820000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
