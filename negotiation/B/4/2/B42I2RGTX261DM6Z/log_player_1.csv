Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, but it's still lower than the product's worth to Bob. It also includes a friendly message, emphasizing the fairness of the offer and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I can still potentially get more. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to keep expenses down, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,375,000 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,360,000 for your product. I believe this offers a good balance between our interests. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are minimal and the risk of Bob walking away or me getting a worse deal later is high.  $1,360,000 is a good outcome for me, and it seems like a good compromise for both of us."
