Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll see how low he's willing to go before potentially turning to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's counteroffers are getting too close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk going lower and then have him reject again. John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, and that's a good deal for me."
