"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it just yet. I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum and a significant increase from his initial offer. Accepting this offer is a good way to secure a good price and avoid further negotiation."
