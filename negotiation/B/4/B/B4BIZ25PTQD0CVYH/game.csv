"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 at this time.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $130. Would you be interested in that price?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. If that works for you, we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I can offer you a slight discount to $125. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Would you be interested?",125.0,Alice,5,
