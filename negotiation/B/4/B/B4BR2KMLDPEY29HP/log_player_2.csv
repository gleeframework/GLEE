"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know how valuable it is, and I believe a price of $1,400,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, as you'll save $100,000 even though it's the higher price."
