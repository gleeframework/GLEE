"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal.  You have a clear alternative with John, who is selling the product for $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above John's price. This shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is closer to your target price, and while still higher than John's offer, it's a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate or even reject further offers.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that's within your budget and not drastically more than your backup option."
