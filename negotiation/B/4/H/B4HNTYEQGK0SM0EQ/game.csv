"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some flexibility. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $9,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $9,500?  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
