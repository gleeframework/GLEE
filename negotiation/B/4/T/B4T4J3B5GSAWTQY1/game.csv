"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
