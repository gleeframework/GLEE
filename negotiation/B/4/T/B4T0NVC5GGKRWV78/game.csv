"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $1,100,000 is a strong offer, the true value of this product is reflected in its potential to significantly impact your business. I'm confident it's worth considerably more to you in the long run.  Could you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
