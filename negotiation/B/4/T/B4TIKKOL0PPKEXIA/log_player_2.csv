# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for you, but the product's value to you is worth it.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I need to continue negotiating to get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and hopefully reach a more favorable price."
