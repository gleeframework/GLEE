"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  $140 (Alice's price) is less than $150 (John's price).
* **You still get a good deal:**  You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that."
