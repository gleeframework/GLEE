"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if that works for you.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,375?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $11,375 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. I can offer you the product for $12,750, which is a compromise that gets closer to your desired price while still allowing me to make a profit.",12750.0,Alice,5,
