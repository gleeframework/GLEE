"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I will get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to explore other options.  Let me know your decision.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
