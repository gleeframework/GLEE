{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

By starting with this offer, you're setting yourself up for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I will get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below the $1,500,000 you can get from John. It's better to try and negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows Bob you're willing to compromise and move closer to his offer.
* **Fairness:** You frame the offer as fair to both of you, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Openness:** You leave the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you can get from John. You can try one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price, but if he rejects again, it's probably time to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to explore other options.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This emphasizes that you're serious about this price and won't go lower.
* **Reasoning:** You provide a reason for your offer, reminding Bob of your previous willingness to compromise.
* **Decision Time:** You put the ball in Bob's court, making him realize that a decision is needed.

This counteroffer is a firm but fair compromise. If Bob rejects this, you have a solid justification to move on to John."
