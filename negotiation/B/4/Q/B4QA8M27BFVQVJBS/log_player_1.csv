Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum desired price of $10,000, but leaves some room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer since the product is worth $12,000 to him, giving you a chance to potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is a good price, I'm going to try and push for a bit more. I can potentially get closer to my desired value by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,250. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still below my ideal price.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, and it's very close to my desired price. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $11,050.  Further negotiation is unlikely to gain me a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
