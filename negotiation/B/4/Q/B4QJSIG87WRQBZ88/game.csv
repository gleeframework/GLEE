"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to me is much higher. Let's get this deal done!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  While $1,225,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not there yet.  Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both something to gain. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
