The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While $95 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob has already made multiple counteroffers, and Alice has consistently rejected them.  The price is now at $92.50, which is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small decrease in price, and it's not worth the time and effort.  At this point, it's best to accept John's offer and buy the product for $80."
