{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than what I'd ideally want, but it still gives me some profit and could potentially lead to a successful negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than Bob values the product, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested, but $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $90.  That's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum.  There's still a good chance that Bob will accept a price closer to my desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
