{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and avoids instantly shutting down the deal.  It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is the highest he's offered so far and it's only $2,000 below my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  it's a decent deal, and I'm not sure how much more I can push Bob. Selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, but it's not guaranteed, and this offer allows me to close the deal with certainty."
