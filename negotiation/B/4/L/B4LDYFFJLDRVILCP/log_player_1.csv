Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I get a fair return.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price aligns better with my budget and valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and it's a price that still provides me with a fair return. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought, and I believe $960,000 is the maximum I can offer for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's only slightly below my minimum, and I'm confident we can work out a good deal in the future. It's better to secure this sale than risk losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
