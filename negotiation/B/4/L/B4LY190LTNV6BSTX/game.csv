"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,000,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it remains a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget and my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued negotiation.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to find a price that better reflects the product's worth. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This represents a significant concession, and I'm confident that it's a fair price that will benefit both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
