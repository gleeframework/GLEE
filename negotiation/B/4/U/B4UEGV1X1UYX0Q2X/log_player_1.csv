{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing Alice at least $1,000,000. Therefore, Alice's goal is to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  
* **Finding a Sweet Spot:** Alice's offer should be attractive to Bob (higher than his valuation) but leave room for Alice to maximize her profit. 
* **The Offer:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but it's still a substantial discount from what John is willing to pay. This gives Bob a strong incentive to accept while still netting Alice a great price."
