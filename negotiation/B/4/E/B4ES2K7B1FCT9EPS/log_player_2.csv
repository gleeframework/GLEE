"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is the best move for Bob at this point:

* **Rejecting the offer:** $130 is too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible.  
* **Not buying from John:**  There's still potential to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer and counter again.  While $115 is closer to Bob's goal, there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $110. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
