"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  It has the potential to generate substantial returns for you, well beyond that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. Given the potential of the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
