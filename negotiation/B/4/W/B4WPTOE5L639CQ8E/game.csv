"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130 again?",130.0,Bob,6,
