I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to get a better deal. This leaves room for negotiation and still ensures I get a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."

This is my final counteroffer.  I've lowered my price again, but it's still above my minimum and represents a fair compromise. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's not quite there yet. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than what I'd get from Bob, so it's a better choice for me."
