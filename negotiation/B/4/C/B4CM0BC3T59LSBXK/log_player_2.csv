This is a much better deal from John.  I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

I'm going to start with my maximum price. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to Alice and $80 to me. Hopefully, she'll accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."

While $125 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum price. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

While $110 is tempting, it's still above my maximum price. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. If I don't get closer to my target, I'll just go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

$105 is still higher than I want to pay. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get it down to my target price. If not, I'll just buy it from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
