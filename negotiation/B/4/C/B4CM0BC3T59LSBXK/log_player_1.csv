"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation but still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'll reject it. I'll try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm reducing my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's more favorable to me than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a compromise point."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a great deal. I'll try to get a better price in the next round. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is a bit closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum in the next round.  However, I'm starting to worry about time running out and having to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a great deal and with only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
