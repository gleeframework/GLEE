"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is a good price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
