"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally below his $12,000 limit. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is far too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $5,000. This demonstrates his serious interest while also establishing a lower negotiation point. It's important to be aggressive early on, but not unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his target. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit but still wants to save some money. He's offering a compromise by increasing his offer to $11,500, which is only $500 above his target. This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is a good price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is actually higher than her initial offer of $12,500.  This is a clear indication that Alice is not willing to meet Bob's needs. Given that Bob is willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John, it's now a better decision to buy from John. This saves Bob time and the stress of further negotiation."
