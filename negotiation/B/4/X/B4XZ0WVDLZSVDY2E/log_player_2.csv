"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find highly desirable. I'm willing to let it go for $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice is willing to go lower, and I want to see how far I can push the price down.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $775,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant drop from her initial offer, and I'm comfortable with that price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or I'll end up paying more by buying from John. It's better to lock in this deal and save $225,000."
