"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $16,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $16,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $16,000 is closer to the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $14,000 is still above my budget. It's worth seeing if I can get her down further. There are still plenty of rounds left, and I can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
