"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $16,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $16,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $16,000 is closer to the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stated $11,000 is his final offer. While this is closer to your minimum acceptable price, you have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit than to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially for a lower return."
