Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the value I see in this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite aligned on price yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value of the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's clear we are too far apart on value, and I'm running out of time. Selling to John is the best option at this point."
