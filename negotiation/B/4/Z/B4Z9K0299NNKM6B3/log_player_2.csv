You are trying to get the product for as cheap as possible, and $100 is still more than your maximum budget of $80. Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer of $70.  This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $100 and is within my budget.  It's a bold move, but hopefully it will encourage Alice to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $80 if I don't get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4

{""product_price"": 75}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $87 is just a bit too high. I'm not willing to go above my budget, even though it's close.  Since I've reached a point where I'm not getting any better deals from Alice, I'll take the guaranteed price from John."
