Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but well above my minimum ($100).  This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a good profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is crafted to be appealing and non-confrontational, highlighting the product's value to Bob.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option open to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a price closer to $110. Accepting $100 from John is my fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Target Price:**  $110 represents a fair compromise, splitting the difference between his offer and my previous price. 
* **Clear Justification:** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" I offer a simple and understandable rationale for the counteroffer. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It seems like we're getting closer Alice. How about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my preferred selling price. While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting $108 secures a profit and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down. It's a reasonable compromise and a good outcome for both of us."
