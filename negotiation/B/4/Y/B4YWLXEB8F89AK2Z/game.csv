"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique qualities of the product, $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1800000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of your budget. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1800000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our previous discussions.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1700000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in this negotiation. While I understand the value of the product, $1700000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1550000, which represents a significant investment for me and I believe is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. Would you consider this offer?",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm glad we're able to have a productive conversation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1900000. This is a bit of a stretch for me, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,7,
