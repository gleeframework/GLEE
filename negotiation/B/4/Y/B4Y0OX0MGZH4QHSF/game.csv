"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $12,200. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500, but I'm willing to make a compromise. How about $12,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
