Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1200000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1250000 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $1300000? This is very close to my minimum, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this valuable product. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other offers.
