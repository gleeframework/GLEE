"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly highlighting the product's value can make the offer more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer (or lack thereof). If he rejects my offer, I'll consider lowering the price slightly in subsequent rounds, but I'll always keep the minimum value of $150 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I have 8 rounds remaining, and I can make counteroffers to try and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet.** While John offers a guaranteed $150, I'm hoping to get a higher price by negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for compromise.  I'll also be mindful of the number of rounds remaining and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Still above minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose out on value.
* **Open-ended message:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to further lower the price, keep it the same, or even consider selling to John in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **We're getting closer.**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price.
* **There's still time.** We have 6 rounds left, and I can make further counteroffers to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John is a safety net.** While I want to get the best price possible, selling to John for $150 is still a good option if we can't close the deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to $130 but still above my minimum. I'll also continue to gauge his interest and willingness to compromise.  If we can't reach an agreement in the next few rounds, I'll start considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you - we're getting closer! Let's split the difference. How about $135? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130). This shows a willingness to meet him halfway and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of closing the deal, suggesting a sense of finality to encourage acceptance. 
* **Fairness:** I'm reframing the offer as being ""fair"" for both of us, which can be persuasive.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, hoping to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider my options more carefully. If we reach round 8 or 9, I'll likely start seriously considering selling to John for $150 to avoid the risk of ending up with no deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **We're nearing the end.** We only have 4 rounds left, and there's a risk of not closing a deal.
* **John is a viable alternative.** While I prefer to get a higher price, John offers a guaranteed $150, which is closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $135. If he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John in the final round to ensure I don't lose out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but this is the final offer I can make. $130 is my absolute minimum. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Minimum Price:** I'm reiterating my minimum acceptable price, setting a clear boundary.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make the offer more appealing.
* **Alternative Options:** I'm subtly hinting at selling to John, increasing the pressure for Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the final round. I've reached my minimum price, and I don't want to risk ending up with no deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $130 is your minimum, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125, or is that not possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **We're down to the wire.** This is the second-to-last round, and there's a high risk of not closing a deal. 
* **John is the safe choice.** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a good deal and eliminates the risk of ending up with no sale. 

**Next Steps:**

I've reached my limit for negotiation and don't want to risk getting stuck with the product. Selling to John is the most secure and sensible option at this point."
