"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $128?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $128 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  Let's try $132. It's a small step up, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $132, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $129?",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $129 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase. ",130.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,8,
