Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  How about we settle at $950,000 and close this deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $950,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and leaves a significant profit margin.  It's always possible negotiations could break down, and I risk getting a lower offer in subsequent rounds."
