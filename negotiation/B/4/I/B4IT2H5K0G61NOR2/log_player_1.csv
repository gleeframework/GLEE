"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to consider offers up to $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000).**  There's no incentive to keep negotiating, as I'm already at my floor price.
* **Selling to John would be the same price.** While John is guaranteed, there's no upside to rejecting Bob's offer.
* **The risk of further negotiation is too high.**  Bob might not budge further, and I could end up with nothing or a lower price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get the minimum I need and avoid potential losses."
