"Alice, $12,000 is well above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can agree on a price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. It's a bit more than you offered, but I think it's a fair price for this product considering its value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
