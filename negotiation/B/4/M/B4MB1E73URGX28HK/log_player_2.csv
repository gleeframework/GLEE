{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $9,000. This is a bad deal. You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It leaves room for compromise while demonstrating your commitment to getting a good deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is still worth $8,000 to you, and Alice's offer is only slightly less than that. This is not a good deal. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}

You're getting closer to your target price. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a higher price than your previous offer but still less than Alice's. It shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining your goal of saving money."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

This is your final offer, matching the value of the product to you. Since you have a backup option with John, you can be firm on this price, and it's likely Alice will accept it rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tedious, and Alice is unwilling to budge much further. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's best to take that route. You'll save time and effort, and still get the product at your target price."
