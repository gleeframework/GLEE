Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a strong offer, giving Bob a potential $2,000 gain (his perceived value of $12,000 vs. purchase price). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this initial offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing the final sale price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slight discount, might be preferable to waiting for John."
