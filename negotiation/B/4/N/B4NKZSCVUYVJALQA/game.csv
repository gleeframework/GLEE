"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $20,000 might be a little high, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
