"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a good deal considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
