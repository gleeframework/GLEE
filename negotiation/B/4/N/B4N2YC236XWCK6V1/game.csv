"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit margin while I get a fair price for my valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a good deal considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum. This price still allows you a decent profit margin, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
