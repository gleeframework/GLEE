""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $800,000 gives you leverage.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Creates a sense of urgency and value. 

By starting at $925,000, Alice leaves space to potentially negotiate down while still securing a significant profit above her minimum acceptable price."
