"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest.  He's likely to counter, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm willing to hold out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my floor, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm open to negotiation, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price than $750,000.  While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I believe I can get more from Bob with continued negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm coming down to $850,000. It's closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth. I'm hoping this counteroffer will make Bob see the value in a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is coming down significantly, but I'm reaching the point where it's becoming a risk to keep negotiating.  John offers a safe, guaranteed price of $800,000, which is my floor. It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
