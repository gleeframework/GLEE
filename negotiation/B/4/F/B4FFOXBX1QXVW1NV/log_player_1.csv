"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  $15,000 is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 

This strategy balances the need to earn as much as possible with the risk of losing the deal if my initial offer is too high. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with such a low profit margin.  I want to try to get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds remaining, which gives me ample opportunity to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from $15,000 to $13,500. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin. I believe this price is a good compromise that could be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm running out of time, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value. There's still a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob, or fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $12,500. This shows good faith while still ensuring a profit.  It's a compromise that acknowledges Bob's lower offer but remains above my minimum acceptable price. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a balance between pushing for a better deal and avoiding the risk of selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting Bob to budge significantly are slim. It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  While I'd prefer to get more than $12,000, it's better to secure a guaranteed sale to John and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
