,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. The product is truly unique and valuable, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the product's uniqueness, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my previous offer. I am willing to consider $130 for the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $130. How about we try $132.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price that works for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,
