{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than the price I'm willing to pay. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're stuck in a stalemate. I don't want to risk wasting more time and potentially getting into a bidding war that could push the price higher. 

Instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice, it's in my best interest to go with the guaranteed price from John. This ensures I get the product at my target price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
