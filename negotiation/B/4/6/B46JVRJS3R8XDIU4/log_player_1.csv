{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum value ($150) but still allows for some negotiation room.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, but also highlighting the value of the product. 

This offer balances maximizing profit while also keeping the negotiation open. I believe Bob is likely to counter-offer, allowing for further negotiation and potentially reaching a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I'll counter-offer Bob to try and get a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  This would still be a great price for you and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $115, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while also highlighting that my previous price was reasonable. By focusing on finding a fair deal, I aim to keep the negotiation positive and increase the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to meet in the middle one last time. How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $110, which is a slight concession from my previous offer of $115, but still closer to my minimum value of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and reminding Bob of the product's value. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting this is the last offer I'm willing to make.

I believe this final counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
