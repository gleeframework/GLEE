"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a bold move, but I'm aiming for the highest possible profit. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to play ball at a price higher than the minimum I'd accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'm going to see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $875,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's tempting enough for Bob to accept. I'm trying to find that sweet spot where both of us can walk away happy."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to the price John is offering, I'm still hoping for a higher price. We have four rounds left, and I think I can push for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 835000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $835,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's tempting enough for Bob to accept.  I'm running out of time, so I need to start getting closer to a final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's only $15,000 less than John's offer, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better price from Bob. We have two rounds left, and I'm not giving up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $825,000. It's close to Bob's offer, but still a bit higher. It's a risky move, but I think it's our last chance to get a better price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to settle for John's offer."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob's offer of $810,000 is better than John's offer of $800,000, but it's still below my ideal price. However, with no more rounds left, I need to make a decision.  I'm going to choose to sell to John for $800,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a good deal, and I'd rather guarantee a sale than risk losing out on the deal entirely by rejecting Bob's offer."
