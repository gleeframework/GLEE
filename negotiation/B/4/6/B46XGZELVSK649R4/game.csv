"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe the product is worth it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
