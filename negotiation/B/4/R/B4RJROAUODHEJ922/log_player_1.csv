Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I want to close the deal, $8,500 is still too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit below that. How about $8,750? I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm not desperate for a sale, so I'll try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $8,900? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below $8,900. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but I want to be honest with you, I'm also considering buying the product from another seller who is offering it to me for $8,000. I'd rather do business with you, but I need to make a decision soon. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and while I'd prefer to do business with him, the risk of him going to another seller is too high.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and avoid any further negotiation."
