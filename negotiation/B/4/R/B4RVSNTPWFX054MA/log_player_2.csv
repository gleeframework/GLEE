"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially lower the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his target price of $8,000 as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and demonstrates Bob's serious interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, he's still willing to negotiate further. Bob is confident he can get a better price by continuing the negotiation process.  He's also likely weighing the risk of Alice walking away against the potential savings of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product.  $9,500 is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for further negotiation.  He's trying to find a middle ground while remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see that we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $10,200 is tempting, he's only $200 away from his target price of $10,000.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, $10,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to get closer to his target price.  $9,800 is a strong offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also remaining within his budget.  He's hoping to find a compromise that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,800. I'm proposing a price of $10,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is only $100 away from his target price.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a high risk that Alice will walk away.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice.  Bob saves $4,900 compared to Alice's initial offer and gets a good deal.  He also avoids the potential of losing the product and having to buy from John at a higher price."
