You can get the product for less than $12,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to get a better price."

You are still in a good position to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down further."

You've managed to negotiate the price down significantly. While you might be able to push Alice a bit more, the risk of her rejecting your offer and ultimately having to buy from John for a much higher price is not worth it.  At $11,250, you're still getting a good deal and saving a considerable amount compared to John's offer."
