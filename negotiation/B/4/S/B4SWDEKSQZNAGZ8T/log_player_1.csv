I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. 

If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still guaranteeing a minimum sale price."
