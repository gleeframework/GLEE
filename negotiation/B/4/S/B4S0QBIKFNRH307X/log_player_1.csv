Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. This product would be worth around $6,000 to me. How about $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers significant value that I'm sure you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,000 is still too high for me.  I could consider something closer to $7,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. $7,000 is really cutting it close to my minimum. Could you meet me at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a strict budget. I can do $7,500, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower offer."
