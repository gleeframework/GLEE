"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. This product would be worth around $6,000 to me. How about $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers significant value that I'm sure you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,000 is still too high for me.  I could consider something closer to $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. $7,000 is really cutting it close to my minimum. Could you meet me at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a strict budget. I can do $7,500, but that's my absolute limit.",7500.0,Bob,6,
