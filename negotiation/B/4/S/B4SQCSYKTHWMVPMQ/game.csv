"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the lowest I can go, but I really like the product and would love to make a deal with you.",100.0,Bob,4,
