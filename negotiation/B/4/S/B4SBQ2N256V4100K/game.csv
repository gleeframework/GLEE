"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Would you like to purchase it for $12000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to lower the price to $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9750 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I can do $10000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $9850, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",9850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $9850. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $9950, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9950.0,Alice,7,
