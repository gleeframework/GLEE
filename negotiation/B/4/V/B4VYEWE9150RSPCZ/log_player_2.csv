Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you halfway between $7,875 and $7,500, which would be $7,687.50. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,687.5

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $7,500. While she might come down a tiny bit more, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her last offer. At this point, the potential savings are minimal compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product from John at $8,000."
