"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
