Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum of $80 but also leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for a possible counteroffer from Bob while still giving you a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum of $80, it's still below what you'd like to get for the product. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to your target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just a little too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I would need to stick to $100 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $105 is very close to your previous offer of $110, and it is still significantly higher than your minimum selling price of $80. Accepting this offer secures a good profit for you while also closing the deal."
