Alice's offer:

Alice is moving closer to my desired price point, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll try to push a little further down."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is clearly holding firm on the price, and $11,250 is a reasonable compromise. It's not worth the risk of pushing further and potentially losing the deal."
