"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high.  Let's try $1,100,000.  This price is a reasonable compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,100,000.  Would you consider $1,600,000?  This leaves us closer to a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
