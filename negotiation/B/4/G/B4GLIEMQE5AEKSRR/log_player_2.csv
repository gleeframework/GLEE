"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly above my budget. I'll counter-offer again, hoping to get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high.  Let's try $1,100,000.  This price is a reasonable compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,100,000.  Would you consider $1,600,000?  This leaves us closer to a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I've decided to go with John's offer of $800,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me a significant amount of money."
