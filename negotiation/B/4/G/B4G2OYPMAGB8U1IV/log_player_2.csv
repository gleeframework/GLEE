"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

We start with a significantly lower counteroffer to test Alice's willingness to negotiate. It's still a reasonable starting point for further discussion while leaving us room to potentially meet in the middle later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, the price is still significantly higher than our alternative option with John. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our desired price range."

""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $925,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits and risks involved."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

We're increasing our offer to demonstrate seriousness and willingness to compromise, but we're still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer at $1,050,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems we've reached a stalemate in the negotiation. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000, and we're running the risk of pushing her away entirely.  Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to cut our losses and buy from him. We save $50,000 and avoid further negotiation."
