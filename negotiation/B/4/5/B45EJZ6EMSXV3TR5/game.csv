"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
