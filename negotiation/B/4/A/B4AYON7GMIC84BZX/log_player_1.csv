"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** $14,000 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, giving me flexibility if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds, and I'm not desperate for a quick sale. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially finding a middle ground. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a good option, I'd prefer to get a higher price if possible. I'll use John as my fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's initial offer ($10,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my offer is fair.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiations amicable."
