{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering $85. This is a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is a good price, Bob can likely still do better by continuing to negotiate. He's already shown Alice he's willing to walk away, so there's room for further compromise."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $82 is closer to Bob's desired price of $75, and with limited rounds left, it's a good deal. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
