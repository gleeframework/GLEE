"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your offer of $90. Given the quality and value of the product, I believe we should aim for a price closer to its true worth. How about we consider $105? This still allows us to find a middle ground while respecting the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway again? I'm willing to compromise and consider $102.50. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",102.5,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm glad we're making progress. I would like to suggest a price of $107.5 for the product.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $100.
