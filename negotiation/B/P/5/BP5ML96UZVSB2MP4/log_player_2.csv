# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm very passionate about, and I think it could really benefit your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500, which is a price that's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
