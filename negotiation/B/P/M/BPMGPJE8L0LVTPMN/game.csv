Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?,1200000.0,Alice,1,
