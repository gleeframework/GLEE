Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:

}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $660,000. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $665,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $665,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $665,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While we might get the price down a little more in the last round, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting the $665,000 offer secures a very good price and avoids the risk of having to pay John's $1,000,000 price."
