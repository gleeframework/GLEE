Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to see how he reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it and counteroffer. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a decent compromise and gets me closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to accept his offer.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him, and I'm not willing to risk waiting to see what happens with John, who is only willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
