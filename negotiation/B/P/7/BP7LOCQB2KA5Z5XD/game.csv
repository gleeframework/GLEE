"Alice, your product sounds great, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. Let's meet in the middle at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10500?  I'm really interested in this product and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11250. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
