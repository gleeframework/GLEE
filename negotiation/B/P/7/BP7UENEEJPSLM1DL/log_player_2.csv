Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a more than fair offer considering its potential return on investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be frank, anything under $1,500,000 wouldn't be fair to the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000  as a final offer. This is a significant concession and a deal you won't find elsewhere.
