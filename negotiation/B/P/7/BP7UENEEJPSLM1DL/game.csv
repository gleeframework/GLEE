"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a more than fair offer considering its potential return on investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still more than I had in mind. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be frank, anything under $1,500,000 wouldn't be fair to the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000  as a final offer. This is a significant concession and a deal you won't find elsewhere.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are still far apart. Your final offer is generous, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  My best offer is $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
