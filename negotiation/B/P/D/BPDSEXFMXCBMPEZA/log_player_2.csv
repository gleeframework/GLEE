"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's the best option to accept. There's no point in negotiating further as you won't get a better price."
