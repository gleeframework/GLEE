"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I can come down to $10500. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I understand you're working within a budget, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,5,
