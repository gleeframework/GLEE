Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I have more rounds to work with, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,400,000, it's been a few rounds and I'm running out of time. Accepting $1,300,000 is a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
