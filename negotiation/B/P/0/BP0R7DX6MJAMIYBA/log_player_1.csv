Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
