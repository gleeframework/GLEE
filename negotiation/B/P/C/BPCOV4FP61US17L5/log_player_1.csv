``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum value, but it allows for some negotiation space. If Bob rejects, we can explore counteroffers. However, I'm always prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a large discount. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below this price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $1250000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum value, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and it's possible that Bob might back out.  It's better to secure this deal now and avoid further risks."
