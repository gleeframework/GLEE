"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value is far greater. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is still a great deal for you, and it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $1250000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
