"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $110 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $108 is still more than I'd ideally like to pay, it's a fair price. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $108."
