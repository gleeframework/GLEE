Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a good price. If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$90 is far too low for me. I'm not going to accept that. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $130 is still a fair price given my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to come down to $115.  This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum and leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob."
