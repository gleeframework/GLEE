"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can only go up to $11000. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12250? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
