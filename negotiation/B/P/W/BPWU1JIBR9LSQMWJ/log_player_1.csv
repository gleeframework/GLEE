Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $20,000. This is a fair price considering its potential value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response to determine my next move.  If he rejects, I'll assess if his counteroffer is worth considering or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be high, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at the same price, it's more efficient and risk-free to sell to John."
