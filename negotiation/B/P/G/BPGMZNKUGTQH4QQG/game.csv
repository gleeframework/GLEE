"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $1,200,000 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer of $700,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer of $600,000.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  To be honest, I've found similar products for less, but I believe yours offers unique advantages.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a final attempt to make this work.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've done your research and found similar products, but I'm confident that this one stands out from the rest. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,7,
