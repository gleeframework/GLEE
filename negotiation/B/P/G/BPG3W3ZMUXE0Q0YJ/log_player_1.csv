Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is way above my budget for this product. I'm interested but could only consider a price closer to $10,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
