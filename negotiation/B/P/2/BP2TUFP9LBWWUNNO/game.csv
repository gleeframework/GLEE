"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its market value is $1200000 to you. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to me and your own valuation, I'm willing to offer $750000. This would provide a fair return for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to you and my own valuation, I'm willing to offer a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference again and go with $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while still remaining within my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
