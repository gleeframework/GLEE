"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $100. This means there's room for negotiation.
* It's always wise to try and get a better deal, especially since there are 9 rounds remaining. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* While $95 is better than $100, it's still above Bob's ideal price. 
* There are still 7 rounds left, so there's more room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $92. Would you be willing to go that low?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we meet at $94? It's still a good price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but also to get the product.
* Alice has lowered her price from $100 to $94.  This is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.
* With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers, as time is running out and Bob could be forced to buy from John at $120.
* Accepting the offer at $94 allows Bob to secure the product for a good price, while still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
