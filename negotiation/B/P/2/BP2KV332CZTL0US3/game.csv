,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $92. Would you be willing to go that low?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we meet at $94? It's still a good price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",94.0,Alice,5,
