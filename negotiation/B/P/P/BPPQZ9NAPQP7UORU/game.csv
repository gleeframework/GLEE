"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $150.  Would you be interested in buying it for $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can't go higher than $95.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that I don't lose too much on the sale.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,6,
