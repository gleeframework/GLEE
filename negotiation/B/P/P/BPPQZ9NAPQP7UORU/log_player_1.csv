Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $150.  Would you be interested in buying it for $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, as I want to maximize profit.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm giving a reason for the price (""worth at least $150"") to establish a baseline value in Bob's mind.
* **Flexibility:** Offering a slightly lower price ($140) shows I'm open to negotiation.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still leaving room to adjust the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($100). While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to take such a big loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but immediately making a counter-proposal to show I'm still engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $140 to $110, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm highlighting my flexibility and suggesting a price that's closer to my minimum value, aiming to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can't go higher than $95.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I want to avoid selling to John for a lower price than I might be able to get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that I don't lose too much on the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This is my last counteroffer.  It's very close to my minimum value, but it shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both of us to create a sense of compromise and appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  I'm reiterating that I don't want to lose too much, subtly suggesting that this might be my final offer. 

By offering $105, I'm hoping to reach a final agreement with Bob, as it's only $5 less than my minimum. If he rejects, I'll be forced to accept John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer.  This is a good outcome, as I'm getting my minimum price without further negotiation."
