Round 6
Bob's offer:

While not ideal, we've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him walking away. Accepting his offer of $1,920,000 secures a significant profit above both our minimum and John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
