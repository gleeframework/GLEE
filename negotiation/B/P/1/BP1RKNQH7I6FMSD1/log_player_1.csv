Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a profit.
* The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and potentially entice Bob into accepting the offer. 

This strategy balances the goal of maximizing profit with the potential risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially engaging in a prolonged negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,250 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to come up a bit.  

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,250 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum acceptable price. It's a more appealing price point for Bob while still securing a profitable deal for me.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth. It also subtly indicates that I'm willing to negotiate but have a clear lower limit."
