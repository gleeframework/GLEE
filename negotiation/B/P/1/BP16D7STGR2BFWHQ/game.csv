"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $950,000. Can we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is closer to your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
