"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my desired price point. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to consider $8,750 for the product, which still allows us to stay within a reasonable range for both parties. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",8750.0,Alice,3,
