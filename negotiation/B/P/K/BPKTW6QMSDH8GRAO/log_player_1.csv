Round 2

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth so much. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, it's still too low for me to accept.  The time is running out and I'm not sure if I can close the deal with Bob within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
