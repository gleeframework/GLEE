"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to make this deal, $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,112,500. This leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,112,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,090,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate.  $1,090,000 is close but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's try $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to buy. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,095,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1095000.0,Bob,6,
