"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I'm still hopeful to get more.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to meet me halfway."
