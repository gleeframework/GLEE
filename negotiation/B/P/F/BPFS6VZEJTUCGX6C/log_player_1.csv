{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. 

It seems like Bob is not willing to meet my desired price point, and I have only two rounds left. Selling to John will guarantee me $1,000,000, which is still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure the deal with John than risk a further stalemate with Bob."
