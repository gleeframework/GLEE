"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $8,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm definitely interested, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
