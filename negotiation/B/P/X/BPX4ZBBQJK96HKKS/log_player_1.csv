{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's valuation of $8,000 but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the deal. I'm not revealing my minimum price, leaving some room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll sell the product for $10,000.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially negotiate further.
* If the negotiation stalls or doesn't reach a favorable outcome, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $8,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved from my initial offer of $10,000 to $8,500, which is still above Bob's valuation but closer to his offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to compromise. I'm also highlighting the potential benefits of the deal for Bob, emphasizing that it's still a good value for him. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll sell the product for $8,500.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm definitely interested, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my valuation.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

* **Price:** I've raised my offer to $8,000, meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer of $7,500.
