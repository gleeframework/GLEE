Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to increase the chances of Bob accepting my offer.
* **Plan B:**  I have a backup plan with John, ensuring I'm not stuck in a losing negotiation. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I can reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price through a counter-offer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm not comfortable going below $11,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm  counter-offering with a price closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a reasonable price for me.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I'm emphasizing the compromise by suggesting we ""split the difference."" 
* **Focusing on value:** I'm implying that the product is worth more than $9,500. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm still aware of my backup option with John, which gives me confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not lead to a significantly better outcome, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort, allowing me to move on to other potential opportunities.

While I'm leaving some money on the table, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential for further negotiations and the certainty of a sale with John."
