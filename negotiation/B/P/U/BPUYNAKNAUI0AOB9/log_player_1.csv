Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $12,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** By framing the offer with ""before I list it publicly"" and mentioning its worth, you create a sense of potential value for Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Keep in mind that Bob only values the product at $8,000. Your offer needs to either convince him of its higher value or be enticing enough despite the difference.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and selling to John."
