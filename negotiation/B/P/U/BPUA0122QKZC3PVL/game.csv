"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and still offers you a significant value.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $9,200 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting it for less than my original asking price.  What do you say?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
