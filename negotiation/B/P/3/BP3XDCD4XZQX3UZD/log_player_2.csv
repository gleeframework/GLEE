"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll likely experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the considerable worth of the product and represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this, and I respect that.  While $800,000 is closer to its value for you, I need to be mindful of my own investment.  Let's make this happen - I propose $900,000 as my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her ""final offer"" and it's still above your maximum price and John's offer.  While you could try another counter-offer, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much further and you'll waste more rounds. John's guaranteed $800,000 price is the best option now to ensure you get the product without overpaying."
