"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it's a strong opening offer. If Bob is truly interested, I'm hoping he'll at least counter at a reasonable price, giving us a chance to find a mutually agreeable deal.  If he rejects outright, I'm prepared to move to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my opening offer. I'm going to reject this counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is inching closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to reject his offer again and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm still not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a good amount for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a deal done and agree to this price."
