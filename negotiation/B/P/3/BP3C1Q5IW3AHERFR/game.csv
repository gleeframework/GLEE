"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm starting with $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $13000 to make this worthwhile. How about $13500? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500. How about $12750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $12750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13000. That's a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit and keeps us both happy.  Let's finalize this deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12750 and $13000. How about $12875?",12875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to do the same.  I can't go any lower than $13000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to consider other offers.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12750 and $13000, but I need to get closer to $12500. How about $12875 is still too high, but $12875 is a bit too low for you. How about $12750 is too low for you. How about $12900?",12900.0,Bob,8,
