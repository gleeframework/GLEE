# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $13000 to make this worthwhile. How about $13500? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $12750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13000. That's a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit and keeps us both happy.  Let's finalize this deal!
