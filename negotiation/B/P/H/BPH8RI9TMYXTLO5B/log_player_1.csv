Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $800,000. To start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's value. However, $850,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This shows my commitment to making this deal work, but it's the absolute highest I can go.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, but I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal.  It's still too early to sell to John, as I might be able to get closer to $1 million with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm motivated to make this deal work as well.  To meet you closer to your offer, I'm proposing $1,000,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value and offers you a strong return on investment. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  To close this deal, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, $975,000 is a strong offer and shows Bob is serious. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate. It's a good compromise that yields a substantial profit compared to the product's value to me."
