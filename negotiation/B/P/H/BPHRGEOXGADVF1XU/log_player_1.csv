Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired price point. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a potential $100,000 profit for Bob, making it more enticing for him to engage in negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000.  This knowledge gives you leverage and confidence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is good, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price. You have room to negotiate further. You're aiming for the highest possible profit, and settling at this stage might leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims for a compromise that benefits both parties. It shows Bob you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Emphasizing Value:** By reiterating the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob why he's interested and why this price is justified. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps you in a strong position for further negotiation if Bob doesn't accept. You still have room to go down slightly before reaching John's offer, giving you options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'd like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal, even though it's slightly below your initial target. Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Strong Profit:**  You're still making a significant profit of $50,000 above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Bob's statement about walking away at this price adds weight to his offer. There's a risk he'll follow through, and you'd lose the chance to make any profit beyond John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be tiring. Accepting a good offer now provides a clean resolution and allows you to move on. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
