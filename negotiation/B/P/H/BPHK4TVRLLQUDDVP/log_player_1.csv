Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than $8,000, but it gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below my minimum:** $10,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000, so I have room to lower the price if necessary. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but also leaves room for negotiations if he's not immediately willing to accept. 

I'll be ready to respond to any counteroffers he might make, keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, I'm confident I can get a better price.  

I'll counter with a price that's closer to my ideal value while still acknowledging Bob's interest. I'll also emphasize the value of the product to see if I can increase his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This product is truly unique and offers a lot of value that will pay for itself quickly.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no more. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum and it seems like he's unlikely to budge further. It's also a significant improvement on his initial offer of $8,500. 

Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but the negotiation with Bob has already taken time, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to find a buyer with such a high price in the future.  

Accepting Bob's offer will allow me to close the deal quickly and secure a decent profit."
