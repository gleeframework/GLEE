{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is right at my minimum value, and I believe I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's counteroffer.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is now below my minimum value.  I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000, so I'm going to sell the product to John for that price."
