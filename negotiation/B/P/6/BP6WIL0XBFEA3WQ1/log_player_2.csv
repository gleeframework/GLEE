"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would really be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first. $115 is a bit too high for my budget, and I can still get a better deal if I try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to be fair too. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not quite at the price I want, but I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice.  $110 is better than $120 from John, so it makes sense to continue the conversation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's try $107.50 - it's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
