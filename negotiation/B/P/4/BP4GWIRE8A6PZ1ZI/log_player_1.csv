I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Bob will see value in the product that justifies a price close to this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is too low.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit on his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to the $1,500,000 I could get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up to a price I'm comfortable with, otherwise, I'll just sell to John."
