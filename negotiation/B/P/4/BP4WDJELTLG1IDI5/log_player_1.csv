Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Advantage:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without dropping below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in case Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000 and also below the product's value to me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is unwilling to go higher than $6,000 at this point, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **John is a Safe Option:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000 gives me the flexibility to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work for both of us.  This price reflects the product's value, and it's still a fair deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Offering $8,500 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum desired price.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I've emphasized the product's value to justify the price, hoping to convince Bob that it's a fair deal. 
* **Flexibility:**  Offering $8,500 gives Bob some room to counteroffer, but it positions me strongly to get a price closer to my goal. 
* **John is my Safety Net:** The knowledge of John's $12,000 offer allows me to be assertive in negotiations without jeopardizing my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $7,250 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, I believe there is still room for a better deal.  I can likely get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **John is the Fallback:**  Having John as a buyer for $12,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiations without being pressured to accept an offer that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $7,250 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000 to seal the deal. This price is fair considering the product's value, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you agree."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Compromise:** Offering $8,000 is a final compromise, as it's only $250 away from Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price and further convince Bob of its worth.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding ""ready to close the deal today"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept before potentially losing the opportunity.
* **John as the Safety Net:** The knowledge of John's $12,000 offer provides a comfortable fallback position, allowing me to be firm in negotiations while still potentially securing a profitable deal."
