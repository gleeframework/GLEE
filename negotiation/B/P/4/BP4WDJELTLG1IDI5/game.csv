"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work for both of us.  This price reflects the product's value, and it's still a fair deal for you.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $7,250 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000 to seal the deal. This price is fair considering the product's value, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you agree.",8000.0,Alice,5,
