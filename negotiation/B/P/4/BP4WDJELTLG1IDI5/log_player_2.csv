"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
We're aiming to spend much less than $10,000.  It's time to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the price as close to our $8,000 maximum as possible. Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While $6,000 is a big drop, we phrase it as ""meeting in the middle"" to seem more reasonable and less like a lowball offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We don't want to go too low initially and risk offending Alice. This leaves space for her to counter and us to potentially increase our offer slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work for both of us.  This price reflects the product's value, and it's still a fair deal for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we're not there yet. We have some leverage knowing we can buy from John for $8,000.  Let's see if we can push Alice a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows we're willing to move towards her price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""I'm ready to close the deal today"" implies we might be willing to walk away if she doesn't budge, giving our offer more weight.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly above our fallback option of John ($8,000), but still a significant saving from Alice's initial offer.  It keeps us in the game while aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $7,250 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000 to seal the deal. This price is fair considering the product's value, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our maximum price. There's no benefit to rejecting and trying to negotiate further, or buying from John at the same price. We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
