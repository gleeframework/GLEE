"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great value considering its worth to us is $150 and its value to you is $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message aims to remain positive and shows continued interest in the product.  
* **Targeting Savings:** Aiming for $100 would mean a significant saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet in the middle and offer the product for $125. This respects both the value it holds for you and keeps some profit margin for me. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming to get the product for $120 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further down, getting closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $110. Would that be possible?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Instead of jumping straight to John's $120, offering $110 keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a better deal than Alice's current offer.
* **Justification:** By stating your target price range, you give Alice a reason to consider a lower price without completely revealing your bottom line.
* **Maintaining Interest:** The message continues to express your interest and appreciation for Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. How about we compromise at $115? It's still within my desired range and slightly above what you've offered. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is a reasonable compromise. While we could try to push for $110, there's a risk she might not budge further, and we'd end up paying $120 with John anyway. Accepting $115 secures a saving of $5 compared to John's price and avoids potentially prolonging the negotiation."
