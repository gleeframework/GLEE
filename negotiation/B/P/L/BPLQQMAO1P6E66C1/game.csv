"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet in the middle and offer the product for $125. This respects both the value it holds for you and keeps some profit margin for me. Let me know if this works for you!",125.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. How about we compromise at $115? It's still within my desired range and slightly above what you've offered. Let me know if this is acceptable.",115.0,Alice,5,
