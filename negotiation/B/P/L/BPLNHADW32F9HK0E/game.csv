"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, but I'm flexible if we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's talk!",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
