"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to do $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",132.0,Alice,5,
