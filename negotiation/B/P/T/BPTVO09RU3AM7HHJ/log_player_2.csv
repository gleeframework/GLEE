* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not budge further, and Bob risks losing the opportunity to buy at a price lower than John's $12,000.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, accepting the offer secures a good deal and minimizes the risk of the negotiation failing."
