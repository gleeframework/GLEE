"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it will bring me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a win-win for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $12,000, so how about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
