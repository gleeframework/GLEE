"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Alice's valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counteroffer is a compromise between his maximum budget of $12,000 and Alice's offer of $14,000. This offer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product while trying to get a more favorable price. The offer is also not too low that it might make Alice feel like it's not worth her time to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and lower the price further. It's more beneficial to try and get a better deal with Alice than to buy from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit above my budget at $13,500.  How about $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now taking a more aggressive approach, moving closer to Alice's offer. However, $13,000 is still within his acceptable range and leaves a bit of room for Alice to potentially counter. The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition of the product for Bob."
