"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $14,000. This is now a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject another counteroffer and Bob would be forced to buy from John at the higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget and saves him $1,000 compared to John's offer."
