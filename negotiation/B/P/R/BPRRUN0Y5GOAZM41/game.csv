"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000? This would be a good deal for me and still a profitable sale for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant. How about $975,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about purchasing the product, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,075,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
