**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much below $1,050,000. While future counteroffers might bring her down slightly, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's offer of $1,000,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice walking away. John's offer is a guaranteed good deal and avoids further back-and-forth."
