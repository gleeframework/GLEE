"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's in Bob's best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He should reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $950000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, and offer the product for $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on her price, and Bob is getting closer to his budget limit.  It's becoming risky to continue negotiating. It's safer to take the deal with John at $800,000 and secure the product at a price that aligns with his budget."
