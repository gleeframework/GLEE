Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $85. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and it's better to secure the known price of $80 from John than risk further negotiation."
