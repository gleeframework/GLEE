"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $10,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd love to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
