{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for the price (""great deal"", ""valuable"") to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his willingness to pay. If it looks like I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, I'll move on to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer is still significantly lower than my desired value.
* **Potential for Higher Value:**  I'm not desperate for a sale and believe I can likely get closer to my target price with further negotiation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, but  I'm willing to risk missing that opportunity for a potential higher return from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer, likely with a price between $10,000 and $11,000.  I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and consider my options as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm starting with a counter-offer closer to Bob's price, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price in the middle of our two previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, appealing to his desire for a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he seems unwilling to budge, I'll weigh my options of continuing to negotiate or moving on to John. 
* **Adjust Strategy:** If Bob shows a willingness to move closer to my price, I'll adjust my next counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $10,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd love to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's counteroffer is now very close to my desired price point.  
* **Balancing Risk:** While I could try to squeeze out another $500, the risk of further negotiation is high.
* **Opportunity Cost:** I'm getting a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and close to my target. It's a good deal, and the potential for a better price from Bob is uncertain.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. It's a good compromise, and I've secured a reasonable price for my product."
