"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $1100000. This reflects the product's true value, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1050000. This would allow us both to close a deal that's mutually beneficial. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $1050000 is still significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway, but I need to be compensated for the value I'm offering.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1075000.  This would allow us to close a deal that benefits us both.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this deal work for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still not a price that reflects the value of this product for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also under pressure to get a good price.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but it's a price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
