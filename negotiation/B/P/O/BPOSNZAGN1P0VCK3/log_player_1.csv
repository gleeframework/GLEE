Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially get a better price. 
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate:** This makes you appear reasonable and open to finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired $14,000,  accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is the best option in this scenario. 

Here's why:

* **Profit:** Accepting ensures a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Value to Bob:**  $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. 

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and avoid potential delays and risks."
