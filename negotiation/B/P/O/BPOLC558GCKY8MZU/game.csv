"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $680,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",680000.0,Bob,4,
