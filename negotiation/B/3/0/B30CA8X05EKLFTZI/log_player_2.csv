"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,025,000, and it's clear she has other options.  It's not worth risking paying more when you can reliably get the product for $1,000,000 from John."
