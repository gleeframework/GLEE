"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'll save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **Your goal is to save money.** Even though you could get a better deal from Alice in theory (as the product is worth $800,000 to her), it's not worth risking the deal with John."
