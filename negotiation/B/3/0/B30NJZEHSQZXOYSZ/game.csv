"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go a bit further and meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
