You can likely get a better deal than $90, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being a good deal for me."

It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  $85 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}

I'm going to offer $82. This is a small increase from my previous offer, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good price."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and with only 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking getting a worse deal with John. I'll accept her offer of $83."
