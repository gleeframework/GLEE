Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I can offer you the product for $85, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise.

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $80.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
