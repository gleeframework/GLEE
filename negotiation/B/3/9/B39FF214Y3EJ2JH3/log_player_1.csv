"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while also indicating I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be a little more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price. With 6 rounds left, there's still time for a more favorable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a little too low. Let's meet in the middle at $11,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and provides you with a valuable product.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am unable to agree to $11500. I would like to propose a final price of $11250 for your product.
