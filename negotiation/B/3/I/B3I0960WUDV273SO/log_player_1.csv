Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still leaving yourself some room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It states the price and invites Bob to respond.

However, remember this is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's reaction, you may need to adjust your strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take $700,000, it's significantly below my minimum. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before accepting or considering John's offer."
