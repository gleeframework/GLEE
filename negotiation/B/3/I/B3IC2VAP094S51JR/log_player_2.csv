"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal.  Since you value the product at $120, you have room to negotiate and still make a good purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this time.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about $90 for the product? It's still a good deal for you while ensuring I receive a fair return for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is within my acceptable price range of $120. Accepting this offer means saving $30 compared to buying from John.  While I might be able to squeeze out an extra few dollars, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal."
