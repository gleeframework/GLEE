Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desperation, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $815,000?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly very attached to her valuation and is making very small concessions. We're in round 9, and she's unlikely to budge significantly in the last round. At this point, accepting John's offer of $1,200,000 is more strategic, even if it means not getting a ""deal.""  Here's why:

* **Time Cost:**  Continuing the negotiation costs time, which has its own value. 
* **Uncertain Outcome:** There's no guarantee Alice will go below $800,000 even in the final round. 
* **Potential Future Relationship:** Accepting John's offer might be preferable for a future business relationship than pushing Alice to the absolute limit now. 

While it's frustrating to pay John's full price, it's the most logical decision at this stage of the negotiation."
