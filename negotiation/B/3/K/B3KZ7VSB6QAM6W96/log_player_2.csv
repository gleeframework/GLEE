"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than what John is selling it for, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is a fair price for both of us. It's more than what the product is worth to Alice, but still within my budget. This offer gives Alice room to negotiate if she wants to, but it also signals that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92 is too high.  While it's still less than what John is selling for, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. There's a chance I could get a better price from Alice, but it's also possible she will continue to raise the price.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John to ensure I get the product for a price within my budget."
