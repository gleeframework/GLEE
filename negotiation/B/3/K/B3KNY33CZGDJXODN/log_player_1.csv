Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still leaves me with a substantial profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also leaves the door open for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

This initial offer provides a good starting point for the negotiation. It's high enough to potentially tempt Bob, but also leaves room for compromise if he makes a counteroffer. This approach gives me the best chance of securing a deal that's profitable while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's higher than his perceived value of $800,000, it's not enough for me to accept. I'm confident that I can either negotiate a better price with Bob or sell the product to John for my desired price. 

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Bob's offer would mean a significant loss in profit for me. It's always better to try and negotiate a better deal, or to walk away if necessary. I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not pressured into accepting a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:**  This price is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's position while emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a middle ground.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise that could be acceptable to both parties. It demonstrates flexibility on my part while still maintaining a significant profit margin. I believe this approach gives me the best chance of reaching an agreement with Bob, while still being able to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose more money. John is willing to pay my full asking price, which eliminates any risk of ending up with a less profitable deal.

**Reasoning:**

Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible profit and avoids the potential for further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price. It's always better to choose the option that offers the most certainty and the highest potential return."
