{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $18,000 is a starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate down if needed. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 gives me confidence to negotiate aggressively with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial $18,000 offer.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  $15,000 is a good starting point for negotiation but still leaves room for a better deal.
* **Value to Bob:** I don't know Bob's true value of the product, so I'm not ready to settle yet.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 sale with John, which is a good safety net in case negotiations with Bob break down.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a price closer to my initial goal, while still being prepared to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate you taking the time to consider my product. While I understand your budget,  $15,000 doesn't quite cover what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Would you be willing to come up a bit to $16,500? I think we can make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a counter-offer that is closer to my ideal price but still a significant reduction from my initial offer.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm explaining the rationale behind my price, focusing on the value of the product and ensuring it's a fair deal for both of us. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still open to negotiation, showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Backup Plan:** I still have John as a backup, allowing me to stand my ground in negotiations.

This counteroffer allows me to test Bob's commitment while staying within a reasonable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your offer carefully. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product, if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $500 less than my counter-offer of $16,500.  This is a good compromise.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a significantly higher price.
* **Risk of John:**  If I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even if I accept Bob's offer, I can still build a relationship with him, potentially leading to future sales where I could get a higher price.

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit and minimize the risk of a lower sale."
