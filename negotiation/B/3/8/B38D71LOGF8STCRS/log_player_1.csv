Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price of $950,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), providing negotiation room.
    *  Lower than John's offer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing the offer as time-sensitive, we aim to encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit."
