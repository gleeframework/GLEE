Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $20,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a higher perceived value.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You can be more assertive in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is above his perceived value of $10,000, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Below John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed $15,000 from John. Accepting $12,000 would be leaving money on the table.
* ** Aim for Higher:** There's a good chance you can negotiate a price closer to $15,000 with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down from $20,000 to $17,000 shows you're willing to negotiate but also holds firm to a price significantly above both Bob's offer and his perceived value.
* **Targeting Above Midpoint:**  Aiming for $17,000 instead of the exact midpoint ($16,000) leaves room for further negotiation if needed while still striving for a higher profit margin.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying significantly above Bob's offer, you maintain your leverage and signal that you're serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to the $15,000 you're guaranteed from John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price from Bob, but the potential gain is small compared to the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A sale today is generally better than a potential sale tomorrow.  Accepting the $14,000 now avoids further delays and uncertainty."
