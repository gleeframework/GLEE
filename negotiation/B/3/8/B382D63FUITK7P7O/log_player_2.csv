Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  While I understand you have a price in mind, I'm confident the product's value warrants a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.
