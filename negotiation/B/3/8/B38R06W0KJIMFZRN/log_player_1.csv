Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I can't go below $10,000. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase at this price.  Let's close this deal, I'm willing to split the difference from our last offers."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob is not going to meet my minimum price. I've already made several concessions, and he's still refusing to budge. I'm not willing to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price. I'm going to sell the product to John."
