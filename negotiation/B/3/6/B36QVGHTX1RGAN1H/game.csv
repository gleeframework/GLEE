"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $20,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see its value at that price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise but $17,000 is still too high.  Let's try $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,000 is closer, I can't let it go for less than $15,000.  This is my firm offer, as it's already a significant discount from my initial asking price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
