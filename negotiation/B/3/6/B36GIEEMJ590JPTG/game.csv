"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose an offer of $6000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for that price. Considering its value to me is at least $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $12000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I must respectfully decline the $12000 offer. My maximum budget remains at $6000. I understand if we cannot reach an agreement, but I wanted to give it another try. Thank you for considering my position.",6000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still unable to meet me at a price of $12000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a middle ground. However, I am still unable to meet you at a price of $10500. My budgetary constraints remain at $6000. I truly hope we can find a solution that works for both of us, but unfortunately, this is my final offer.",6000.0,Bob,6,
