Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's still a good price for a fantastic product, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still pretty far off from that number though.  How about $75 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting close to just selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $75 is still too low.  I'm offering $100.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer, but $100 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $87.5?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum,  it's still not a good deal for me.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get a reasonable profit."
