"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,150,000. It's getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This price is fair considering both our valuations and allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
