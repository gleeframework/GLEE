Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like.  I'm offering it to you for $90, which is a great deal!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation of the product, giving you a good profit. However, it's also lower than your minimum valuation, ensuring that you make more than selling to John. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a decent price."
