"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above Bob's ideal price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, and the offer is now only $25,000 above Bob's target. Considering that there are only a few rounds left, it's wise to accept this offer and avoid the risk of Alice getting too stubborn or the negotiations breaking down. While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price with more rounds, the current offer provides a good compromise and secures the product."
