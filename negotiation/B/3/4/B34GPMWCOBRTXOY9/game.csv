"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go higher. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
