"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you can save more money by rejecting it. You know John will sell the product for $10,000, but there's a chance Alice might come down on her price if you reject her initial offer."
