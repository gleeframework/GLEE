Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable value of $150.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a good profit margin.  I'm curious to see how much he's willing to pay!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $150, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and hopefully a price he'll be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk him backing out completely or me needing to sell to John for less.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $160."
