"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'm proposing $1100000. This is a fair price given the product's value and the potential benefits it offers your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $950000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my previous offer. I'm proposing $1050000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a win. Let's finalize this agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
