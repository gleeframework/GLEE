"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant premium.  You can likely negotiate a better price.
* **Potential for savings:** You have room to negotiate and potentially get the product for significantly less than $950,000.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** By rejecting the offer, you start the negotiation process and explore options for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $850,000. This product has significant value beyond the market average. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice has come down from her initial price, there's still a gap between her offer and your desired price.
* **Finding a better deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a price closer to your target of $850,000.
* **Potential for counteroffer:** You can counter with a price slightly higher than your previous offer, potentially meeting Alice halfway."
