Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of rounds, and the price is getting closer to my minimum. However, I'm still not happy with the price, and I'm worried that Bob will continue to lowball me. With only 4 rounds left, it's better to sell to John for $100, which is a much better deal for me."
