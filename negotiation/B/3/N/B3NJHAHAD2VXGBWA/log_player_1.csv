Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $16,000 for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my absolute limit. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $12,000 threshold I need.  It's better to take John's guaranteed offer than risk Bob walking away in the end."
