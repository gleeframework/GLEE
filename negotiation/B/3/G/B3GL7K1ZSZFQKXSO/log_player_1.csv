{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a friendly message to encourage Bob to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can likely get a bit more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 would be my best price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $122.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more,  Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting. It's better than selling to John for $100 and there's a good chance further negotiation won't get me a significantly better price."
