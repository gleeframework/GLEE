"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the most profit possible.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value but still significantly above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better price with more negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. $1,050,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in completely.  This offer is still well above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer and is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price and allows me to secure a decent profit. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of Bob rejecting future offers or me needing to accept a lower price from John is too high. It's time to close the deal and secure the $1,000,000."
