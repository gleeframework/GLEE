Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly open to discussion and haven't set a hard deadline. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unreasonable, so I'm not desperate to close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm not desperate to sell and can likely get a better price. 
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially get a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. I don't have to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and is still within a range that's fair for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my previous offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm restating the value of the product to reinforce my position. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize a win-win scenario for both parties.
* **Focus on Agreement:** The message is still positive and encourages a deal.

This counter-offer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep the negotiation going and potentially close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for a much higher price.  
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially jeopardizing the sale to John.

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most financially advantageous decision."
