"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and is still within a range that's fair for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can agree on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
