"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we aim for $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be open to $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're getting closer to my target, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more room to breathe. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a bit more than your last offer, but still a good compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement on price, but the gap between our positions is still too large. I'd be willing to move up to $12,500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,750.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option I have. Let me know your decision.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, which is a bit above your last offer. I'm trying to find a deal that works for both of us. Let's see if we can make it happen.",13250.0,Alice,9,
