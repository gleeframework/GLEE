"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to come down a bit, especially since she's emphasizing how unique and desirable the product is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's definitely intriguing. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm hoping to acquire it for a slightly lower price point.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for this incredible product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value you'll receive. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer. This is a great deal for me, as I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer saves me $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and I risk losing the opportunity altogether."
