"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm eager to make this deal work, $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the benefits you'll gain from owning this. I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",875000.0,Alice,3,
