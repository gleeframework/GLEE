Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's still below John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
