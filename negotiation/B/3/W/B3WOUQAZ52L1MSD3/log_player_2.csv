**Explanation:**

While $120 is your maximum, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to lower the price, especially since you're ready to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

**Explanation:**

Starting with a lower counteroffer of $100 is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about buying but also trying to get a better deal. This gives her room to counter without immediately feeling pressured."
