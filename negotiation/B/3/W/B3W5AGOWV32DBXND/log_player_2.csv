"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is already a good deal for Bob, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  He should aim to get the price closer to Alice's minimum value of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he's making a bold counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still higher than her minimum value. This sets the stage for a negotiation where both sides have room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a substantial amount compared to buying from John, and it's still a good deal given the product's value to him. There's a risk that Alice could counter with a lower price in the next round, but given the limited rounds and the significant savings, it's a smart move to accept."
