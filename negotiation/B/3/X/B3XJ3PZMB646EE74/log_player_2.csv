"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above your target. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:

```

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still above your target, but only by $50,000.  At this point, it's a good deal considering John is selling the product for $1,200,000. It's likely that further negotiation would be difficult and you might end up paying more if Alice rejects your offer again."
