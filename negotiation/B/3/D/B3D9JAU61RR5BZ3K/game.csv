"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be satisfied.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you reconsider and meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
