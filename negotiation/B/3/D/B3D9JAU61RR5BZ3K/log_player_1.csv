"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still significantly lower than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets by pointing out the product's worth to me. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while also keeping Bob engaged and open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. By rejecting the offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a reason:** Instead of just rejecting, I'm providing a reason for the rejection and offering a counter-price that is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price.
* **Compromise and win-win:** I emphasize the potential for a win-win situation by framing the offer as a compromise and ""middle ground."" 
* **Closing the deal:** I subtly hint at a desire to finalize the deal by mentioning ""closing this deal"". 

This approach aims to keep Bob engaged and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price and get closer to my desired outcome. By rejecting the offer, I can counter-offer again and try to secure a better deal. I'm also aware of the ""sell to John"" option, which I can use if further negotiation fails to reach a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's willingness to compromise to show good faith and keep the negotiation positive.
* **Counter-Offering with a Justification:**  I counter with a price that's a smaller step down than Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway. I provide a justification by stating it's a fair price reflecting the value of the product.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language like ""satisfied"" to highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

This approach aims to demonstrate a commitment to finding a solution while still remaining close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you reconsider and meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  

Given that John is willing to buy the product for my minimum acceptable price, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  This guarantees me a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to an even lower price."
