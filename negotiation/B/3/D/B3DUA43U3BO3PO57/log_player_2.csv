"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
