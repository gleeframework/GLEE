I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can negotiate a higher price.  However, I'm also cognizant of my minimum value of $150."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $120 is below my minimum value, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John."
