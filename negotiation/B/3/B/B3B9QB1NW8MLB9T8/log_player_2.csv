"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is still a great deal, considering the market value is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** $11,500 is a good compromise, significantly lower than the initial offer of $12,000 and closer to Bob's counteroffer of $10,000.
* **Time is a factor:** With only 10 rounds, it's in Bob's best interest to accept a reasonable offer before potentially losing out to John or going through more rounds of negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:** While Bob is willing to pay $15,000, accepting at $11,500 is still a good deal for him, saving $3,500. 

**Overall:** This decision balances the desire to save money with the need to secure the product within the limited rounds."
