Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $700,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $700,000 represents a fair price. I would like to propose $750,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchoring his price well below what we know the product is worth to him ($1,000,000) and what it's worth to us ($800,000). Continuing to negotiate with him risks leaving money on the table and prolonging the process. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and allows us to move forward."
