"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a good price, but I'm aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if I can get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my ideal range.  I'm hoping to push Alice to negotiate further down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is better than $6,000, I'm still aiming to save more. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my $4,000 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $4000 to $4500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing counteroffer than my previous one, while still remaining within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,200 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $4,500. I believe there's still room for negotiation. It's worth risking another round to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current offer.  I hope this shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still want a good price.  I'm hoping this will be the offer that Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,000, which is a good price for me. While I might be able to negotiate further, it's getting close to my initial counteroffer of $4,500. I'm also nearing the end of the rounds, and there's a chance I won't be able to get a lower price.  Accepting the offer now ensures I get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer or me running out of rounds."
