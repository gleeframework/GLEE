"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? It's a good price for both of us and avoids any further negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
