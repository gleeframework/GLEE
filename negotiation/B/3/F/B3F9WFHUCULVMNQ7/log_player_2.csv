"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice wants $9,500. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price closer to Alice's minimum value ($8,000) to show I'm serious about a deal. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving some space for Alice to counter and come to a price we both find acceptable. 
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still trying to get a better price than John's $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While slightly better than her first offer, it's still above the product's value to me.
* **Negotiation is ongoing.**  We're still in the early stages of negotiation. There's room for Alice to come down more, and I can make a new counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still too expensive. I can probably negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's offer:** I'm increasing my offer to show I'm serious about buying the product. 
* **Trying to find a middle ground:**  This offer is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer,  showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still too expensive. I'm confident I can get a better price with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging much.**  She's only lowered her price by $200 from her previous offer. This suggests she's not willing to go much lower.
* **Time is a factor.**  We've been negotiating for a while, and it's possible Alice will continue to raise her price. 
* **John's offer is still better than Alice's.**  While John's price is higher, it's guaranteed, and further negotiation with Alice could lead to a worse outcome. 

I'm choosing to buy from John to avoid the risk of Alice continuing to raise her price or stalling the negotiation. It's the most pragmatic decision given the current situation."
