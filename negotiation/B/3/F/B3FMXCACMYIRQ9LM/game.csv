"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering I'm also willing to close the deal quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and my need to close the deal quickly.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
