"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, as it's worth the same to both of us.  If you decide to decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, and John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer allows you to explore other options or negotiate a lower price with John in the future."
