"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. The product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This is my best offer, given my budget constraints. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a significant concession from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $950000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
