Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we settle on $1,650,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal and me to achieve my target price."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,620,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise that would benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,620,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,620,000 is very close to my target price.  I'm willing to accept it, as it's a good deal for both of us and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might drag on and ultimately lead me to sell to John at a lower price."
