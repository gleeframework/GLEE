Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you significant leverage.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $925,000 aims to capture the majority of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($75,000).
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This means you don't have to settle for anything less than that amount.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" and ""limited-time"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but this strategy balances risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
