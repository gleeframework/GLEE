{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my minimum of $100.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I need to push for a better deal, or just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the offer but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, offering a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum.  I'm keeping the tone friendly to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down, Alice.  I'm trying to keep it closer to $70 though. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering significantly lower than my minimum price. While I could accept his offer and make a small profit, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference.  How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's latest one. It's a compromise, but still allows me to reach my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to agree."
