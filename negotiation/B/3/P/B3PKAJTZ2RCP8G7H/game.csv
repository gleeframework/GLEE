"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I can do $180, which is my best price for now. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. Can you consider that?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a balance between price and value, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $170, which is my final counteroffer. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
