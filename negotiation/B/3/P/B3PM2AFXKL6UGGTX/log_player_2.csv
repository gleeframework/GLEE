"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer of $15000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, accepting her offer is the best choice. There is no benefit to rejecting her offer and buying from John at the same price."
