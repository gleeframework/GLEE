"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to make a more significant investment elsewhere. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I believe the product's true value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget right now.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while allowing me to allocate funds to other projects.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I receive fair value for this unique product. Let's compromise at $1,200,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, to be completely transparent,  $1,200,000 is really pushing the limits of what I'm able to spend. I'd be willing to close the deal right now at $1,185,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with other investments soon.",1185000.0,Bob,6,
