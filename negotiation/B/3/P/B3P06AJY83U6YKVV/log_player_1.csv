Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to make a more significant investment elsewhere. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I believe the product's true value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget right now.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while allowing me to allocate funds to other projects. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I receive fair value for this unique product. Let's compromise at $1,200,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, to be completely transparent,  $1,200,000 is really pushing the limits of what I'm able to spend. I'd be willing to close the deal right now at $1,185,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with other investments soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,185,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,185,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,185,000 is a good deal considering he's stated it's his final offer and I'm running out of rounds.  It's also significantly better than selling to John. I'll accept it and close the deal."
