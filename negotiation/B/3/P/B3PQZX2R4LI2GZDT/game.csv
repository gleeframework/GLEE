"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000? This is a compromise that reflects the worth of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $12,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still quite a gap from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $16,000? This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
