Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $110 is above Bob's valuation, but not too high to discourage him completely. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message highlights the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open.  I can always lower the price if Bob counteroffers, but I want to see if he's willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find similar products elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for this product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** While I could accept and sell to Bob, I believe there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing that John is willing to buy for $100 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($95). 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a way to find a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $102.50 is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't undervalue the product.

This counteroffer balances the need to secure a sale with the desire to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $97 for this product. Let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's revised offer of $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** While I could continue negotiating, the gap between our prices is shrinking, and I'm not confident I can get much closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation.

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John rather than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price with Bob."
