Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. This is a very unique product, and I know it will be valuable to you. To be honest, $975,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, especially since she stated her last offer was final. Taking the sure thing with John saves time and money."
