"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm definitely open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we try $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's try this â€“ if we can land at $1,050,000, I think that would be a fair deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  Would you consider $975,000? That's a pretty significant price for me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. This is a very unique product, and I know it will be valuable to you. To be honest, $975,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. However, I'm motivated to close this deal with you. How about we split the difference and call it $1,012,500? That's my final offer.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
