"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $100 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115? This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.25. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",111.25,Alice,5,
