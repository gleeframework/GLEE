"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $17,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept $17,000 when you can get the same product for $8,000 from John."
