"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and framing the offer positively to make it more appealing. 
* **Open for negotiation:**  My message implies I'm open to discussion and potential adjustments to the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While closer to his perceived value, $11,000 is still less than my lowest acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's space to negotiate between Bob's offer and both my asking price and my minimum. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John is a backup:**  I'll keep John in mind as a guaranteed sale at my minimum, but I want to try to secure a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value this product highly, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I think this reflects a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've significantly lowered my price from $14,000 to $13,000, moving closer to Bob's counteroffer.  
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This counteroffer is still above my $12,000 minimum, giving me room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Encouraging agreement:**  I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to move much higher:**  Bob has now offered $11,000 and $11,500. He's clearly set on staying close to his initial counteroffer. 
* **Minimal gains for continued negotiation:** Even if I can push Bob a little higher, it's unlikely to be a significant difference from my guaranteed $12,000 from John. 
* **Time saved:** Accepting John's offer now avoids further back and forth with Bob and ensures I make the sale. 

While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's strategically sound to accept the guaranteed offer that meets my minimum price."
