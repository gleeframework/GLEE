"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, the product's value is significantly higher than $900,000. Let's settle at $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
