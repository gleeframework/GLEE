"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Would you like to purchase it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to you, you want to pay as little as possible. Alice's offer of $95 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer.  It shows you're serious about buying the product, but you're also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This approach gives you the best chance of securing a lower price, while still keeping the negotiations going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about this: I'll offer the product for $90 instead of $85. This still saves you some money compared to its value, while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better offer than Alice's initial $95, it's still not the best deal possible. There's room for further negotiation, and you haven't reached your target price of $85 yet. It's important to remember that you have 10 rounds, so you can afford to be patient and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This way, we can both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious about buying, but you're not willing to accept her last offer. It's a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer ($85) and her last offer ($90).
* **Fairness:**  Framing the offer as ""splitting the difference"" highlights the fairness of the offer, appealing to Alice's sense of equity.
* **Negotiation:** By using a number ending in .50, it shows you're willing to get specific and indicates you're not just throwing out random numbers. It also leaves a bit of room for further negotiation if Alice counteroffers again."
