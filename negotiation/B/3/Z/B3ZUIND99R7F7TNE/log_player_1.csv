Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Would you like to purchase it for $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}"

Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This way, we can both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.
