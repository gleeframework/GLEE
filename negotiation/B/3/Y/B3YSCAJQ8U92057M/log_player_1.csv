Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it! I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum ($150). This gives room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The message leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can make a lower counteroffer or walk away and sell to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low.  Rejecting the offer allows me to:

* **Counter with a more reasonable price:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise.
* **Maintain my position:** Rejecting a low offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price and won't settle for anything significantly below my minimum. 
* **Explore selling to John:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I have the backup option of selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $100, which is halfway between my initial offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($60). This shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Reiterate fair price:** I emphasize ""fair price for both of us"" to suggest a win-win scenario.
* **Stay firm but open:** I'm sticking to my lower limit but leaving the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm trying to keep my budget under $80. Could you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  Given that Bob is unwilling to budge further and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150, it's more beneficial to sell to John. This ensures I get the best possible price for the product and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
