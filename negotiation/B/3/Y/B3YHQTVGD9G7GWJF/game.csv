"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than this.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
