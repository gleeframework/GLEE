Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us and gets this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1,050,000? This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1050000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1000000? This is a fair price that gets us both a good deal and closes this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get closer to my ideal price, $1,000,000 is a good deal considering Bob's initial offer. It's important to remember that negotiations are a give-and-take process, and sometimes you have to compromise to get the best deal."
