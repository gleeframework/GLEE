"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for under $120.  Alice's offer of $175 is way above that. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to $120 as possible.  A counteroffer of $100 is a significant drop from Alice's $175, and could potentially lead to a successful negotiation. This leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to his target while still being within Alice's minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to Bob's target, it's still slightly higher. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might accept a counteroffer closer to $120 or even lower if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $120. This counteroffer of $115 is a reasonable compromise, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still wants a better deal. This leaves room for both sides to potentially agree on a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally reached Bob's maximum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, there's no advantage to continuing the negotiation. Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product at his target price and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers."
