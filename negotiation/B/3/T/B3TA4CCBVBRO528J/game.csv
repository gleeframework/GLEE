"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $132? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",132.0,Alice,5,
