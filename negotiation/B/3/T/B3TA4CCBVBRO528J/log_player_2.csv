"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is less than Bob's maximum of $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target.  By rejecting, Bob can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $135.  Let's split the difference - $130. I'm ready to buy at that price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $132? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is close to target:**  $132 is only $12 more than Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John at a higher price is increasing. 
* **Small difference:** The difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price is now only $2.

It's a good time for Bob to accept and secure a good deal."
