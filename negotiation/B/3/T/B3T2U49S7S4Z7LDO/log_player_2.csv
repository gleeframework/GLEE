I'm starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive but not too far off Alice's value.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my budget. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget.  While I'd love to negotiate further, it's risky to keep rejecting, as I could end up with no deal and having to buy from John.  It's a good price, so I'll accept."
