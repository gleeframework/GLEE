"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm aware that this might be a bit aggressive, but I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get a better price, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not sure how much wiggle room Bob has, but I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to go with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John."
