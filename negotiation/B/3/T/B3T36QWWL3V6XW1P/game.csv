"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the item, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must inform you that $12000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $18000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the $18000 price point. I've carefully considered my budget and what I can afford. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $15000. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
