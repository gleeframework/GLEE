"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with, and it's still a great value for the product.
