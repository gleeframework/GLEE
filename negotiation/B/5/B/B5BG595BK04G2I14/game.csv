"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's see if we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I want to spend.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  That's my final offer, and it's what I'd be willing to pay John.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Bob,6,
