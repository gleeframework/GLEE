"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200. This price reflects my budget constraints while still acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",8200.0,Bob,4,
