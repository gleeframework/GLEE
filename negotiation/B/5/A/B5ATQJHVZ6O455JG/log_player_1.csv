Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting high allows room for negotiation while aiming for the maximum possible profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""significant benefit"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a unique and valuable item. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that this is not a final offer and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's strategically better to aim higher with Bob initially. It's easier to negotiate down than to try and raise a low initial offer."
