{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is above Bob's valuation, but it gives him room to negotiate and still get a good deal. I'm also leaving myself some wiggle room to potentially lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely.  Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
