Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price, close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room for negotiation.
* **Being reasonable:**  I'm not asking for the full $1,000,000, showing I'm open to a deal.
* **Friendly tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully negotiated a good price. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $850,000 is better than John's offer of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than the $950,000 I initially offered. I'm confident I can get a higher price.
* **Negotiation is key:** I'm not ready to settle yet. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I will try to justify this price by highlighting the value of the product and the potential for future collaboration."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. The product's value is truly in the $900,000 range.  Perhaps we can split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  Let's make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stay firm:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer. However, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth to Bob.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's true value, subtly implying that this offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Encouraging finality:** The ""let's make this happen"" phrasing suggests a desire to finalize the deal.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a solid price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to carefully consider my options. Selling to John for $800,000 is becoming more appealing. However, I may try one more counteroffer, potentially lowering the price slightly to $875,000, but only if I'm truly convinced Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $800,000.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer opens the door for potential future business with him, where I might be able to secure a better deal.

**Next steps:**

* **Finalizing the sale:** I will accept Bob's offer and proceed with the sale, ensuring all legal and financial aspects are handled properly.
* **Future considerations:** I will keep in mind the potential for future deals with Bob, but I will also be mindful of my own minimum acceptable price in any future negotiations."
