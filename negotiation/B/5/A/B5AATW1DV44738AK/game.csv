"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $700,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I can offer you the product for $675,000. It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
