"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer. While $95 is within your budget, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price or you can stick with your backup plan of buying from John and save $5."
