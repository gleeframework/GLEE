"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to negotiate, but I'm going to need to come in lower.  How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I need you to meet me at this price. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still a little high.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms. I'll sell the product to you for $1,250,000, but I'd like to throw in some additional services and support that will enhance the value of the product for you. This way, you'll get even more value out of the deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
