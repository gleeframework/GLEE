Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, who values the product at $800,000.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
