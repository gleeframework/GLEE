"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product. I could come down to $180, which is a fair price considering its quality and features.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $180 is still too high for my budget. I could consider $70.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair deal.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To show I'm flexible, I'll come down to $150, but that's my absolute lowest.  It's a steal at this price!",150.0,Alice,5,
