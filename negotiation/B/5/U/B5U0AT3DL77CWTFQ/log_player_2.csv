"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $230. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $230. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $230
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product. I could come down to $180, which is a fair price considering its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $180 is still too high for my budget. I could consider $70.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To show I'm flexible, I'll come down to $150, but that's my absolute lowest.  It's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm at $150, which is her product's value to her.  She's unlikely to go much lower. You've already moved significantly in price, and you have a standing offer from John for $80. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds when you have a guaranteed good deal elsewhere."
