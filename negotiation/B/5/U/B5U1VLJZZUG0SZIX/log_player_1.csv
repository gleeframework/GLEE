Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my price range. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $10,000. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $12,000 threshold. Accepting his $10,000 offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the sale with John."
