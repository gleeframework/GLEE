"Hi Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite low for what I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my price range. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $10,000. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
