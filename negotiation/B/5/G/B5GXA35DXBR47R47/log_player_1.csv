Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I have 8 rounds left to work with Bob, and I'm confident I can find a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to get a little worried about running out of time, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping that Bob will come up a bit more. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. He's offered my minimum price, and I'm running out of time. While I could sell to John for the same price, I'd rather finalize the deal with Bob. There's always a chance that I could get a better offer from him in the future, and I'm willing to take that chance."
