"I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm looking to save some money, but I'm still interested in making a deal.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
