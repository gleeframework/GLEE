"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",120.0,Alice,5,
