"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while giving us both a good deal. Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
