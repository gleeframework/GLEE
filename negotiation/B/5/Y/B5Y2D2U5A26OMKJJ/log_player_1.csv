Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it fairly reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this happen.
