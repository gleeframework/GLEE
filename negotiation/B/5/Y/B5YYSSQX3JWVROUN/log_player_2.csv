"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000, and John is willing to sell for that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no reason to negotiate with Alice as you're already at your price limit, and there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price from her."
