,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a price I can work with.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? It's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  I'll accept $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further negotiation. If you decline, I will have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no more. This is my final offer.",8800.0,Bob,6,
