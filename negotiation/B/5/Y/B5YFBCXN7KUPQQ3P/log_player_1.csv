{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  Leaving room for potential concessions if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? It's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counter Bob's offer once more and see if we can finally reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  I'll accept $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further negotiation. If you decline, I will have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no more. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,800 is still far below my minimum price of $12,000. It seems we've reached an impasse.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more lucrative deal with John.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't make a deal with Bob, it's clear that he's not willing to pay what the product is worth to me."
