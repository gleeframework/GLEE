"Thanks for offering your product, Alice. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $120. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for you.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I've already discounted the price significantly, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer: $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
