Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1000000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good investment for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This shows my genuine interest in your product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,100,000 is a good deal and it's important to close the deal before I run out of rounds."
