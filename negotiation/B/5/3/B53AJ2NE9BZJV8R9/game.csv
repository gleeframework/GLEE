"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now.  I think a price closer to $650,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While that price is closer, I'm aiming for something under $750,000.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
