Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value of $120, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for it, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $130 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a successful agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I perceive in the product, I would like to propose $135 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and $135 is only $5 away from my initial asking price.  It's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John only nets me $120.  Accepting this offer is the best move for maximizing my profit."
