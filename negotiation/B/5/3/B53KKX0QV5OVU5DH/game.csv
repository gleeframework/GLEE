"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price given the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also providing a good margin for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with a little more discussion.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $887500? This price still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $887500.  I'm willing to go up to $870000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to get a great deal.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the time it's taking to finalize the deal. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $882500? This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",882500.0,Alice,7,
