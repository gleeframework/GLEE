"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount,  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you, and it's the maximum I can offer at this time. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in a negotiation. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a compromise that aims to meet both our interests. Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable, or if there's anything else we can discuss to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it will allow us to reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
