"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's worth to you ($120). There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is lower than the $100 she initially offered and is still below my maximum price of $120. It's a good deal considering the value of the product to me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer and the price might go back up. Accepting her offer guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
