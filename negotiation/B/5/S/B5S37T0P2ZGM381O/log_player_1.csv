"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit.
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I use the phrase ""Let's see if we can come to an agreement"" to indicate flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's crucial to remember that I can secure a better deal with John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to maintain leverage.
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still allows for further negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The phrase ""Let's work together to find a compromise"" maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is my maximum offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  It's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum requirement.  It's more advantageous to sell to John at this point, guaranteeing a profit of $1,500,000.  There's a risk of further negotiations with Bob resulting in a lower price, and it's not worth the gamble."
