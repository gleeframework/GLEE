"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a good profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can work something out.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $14,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",14500.0,Bob,6,
