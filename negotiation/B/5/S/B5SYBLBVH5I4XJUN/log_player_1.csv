Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm confident it's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is too low. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $125?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $112? That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and it's likely we won't get closer. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $112 is a reasonable price."
