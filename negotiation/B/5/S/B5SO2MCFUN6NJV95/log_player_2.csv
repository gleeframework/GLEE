"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value and potential of the product. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000? This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $1,300,000.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer. Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
