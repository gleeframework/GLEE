"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $950,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
