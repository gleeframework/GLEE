Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a bit more than $850,000 from Bob.  It's worth more to him than that, so I think there's room for a counteroffer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $900,000.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely by pushing for a higher amount."
