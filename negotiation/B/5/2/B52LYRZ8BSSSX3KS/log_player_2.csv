"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's a good compromise between his maximum price ($150) and Alice's likely minimum ($120). Offering $115 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is only $5 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and it's significantly lower than the $150 he'd pay John. Accepting this offer gets Bob the product at a price he's comfortable with, without risking further rounds of negotiation that could lead to a higher price or the need to buy from John."
