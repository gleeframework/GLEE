"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it's a great deal considering the alternative buyer is willing to pay $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is ridiculously high. It's not worth engaging with her offer at all. Buying from John at $10,000 is the best choice."
