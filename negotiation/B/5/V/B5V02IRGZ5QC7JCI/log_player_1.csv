Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $9,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could lead to a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a high price, but it leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer.  It also highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" aspect of the offer. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so there's a potential for him to see a price slightly below my minimum as a good deal. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving me with the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
