Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $8,200 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $8,700?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 8700}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $8,300? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,300 is close enough to my minimum threshold and it's a good deal for both of us.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this sale."
