Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm initially suggesting a price of $10,000, but I'm open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets you secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be very telling.  If he accepts, great! If he counteroffers, it gives insight into how much he values the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John provides a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob stagnate or become unreasonable, Alice can always walk away and still get her minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. I started high, anticipating some back-and-forth. Accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table. By issuing a counteroffer, I can try to nudge the price slightly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  $9,000 represents a fair compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Interest:**  This keeps the negotiation open and signals that I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer of $8,500 secures a $500 profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While further negotiation is possible, the increments are likely to be small.  The time and effort required to potentially gain a few hundred dollars more might not be worth it. 
* **Securing the Sale:**  There's always a risk that Bob could walk away if I push too hard. Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
