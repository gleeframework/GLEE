"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $11500?  I think that's a fair compromise that shows we both are willing to work together.",11500.0,Bob,4,
