``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum, but it's still a substantial profit for Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. There are more rounds available and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe and profitable option."
