"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in your product, the price is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1100000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1250000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both the product's potential and your budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
