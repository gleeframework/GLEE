"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a worthwhile deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
