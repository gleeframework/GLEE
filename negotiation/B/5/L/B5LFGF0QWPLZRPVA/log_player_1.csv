"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of potential value for the buyer. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, we establish a high anchor point. While this is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it may influence his counteroffer to be higher than if we had started lower. 
* **Confidence and Justification:** The message projects confidence in the product's value while inviting Bob's perspective, potentially opening the door for him to justify a higher price himself.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he's shown a willingness to negotiate, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and will aim to steer the price closer to our desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant step down from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000. This signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but not desperation.
* **Holding Ground:**  While we moved down, we are still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum price. This maintains pressure on Bob to move closer to our range.
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value to counter Bob's anchoring on a lower price point.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a worthwhile deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away in subsequent rounds. Accepting now secures a profitable deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
