"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $95.  It's worth a lot more to you, so I think you'll find this is a fair price.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50.  Let's compromise at $89.  This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,
