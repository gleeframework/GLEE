"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $95.  It's worth a lot more to you, so I think you'll find this is a fair price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible. While $90 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely push for a lower price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50.  Let's compromise at $89.  This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept the offer. 

* He's currently saving $11 from the original offer.
* He's only $2 away from his counteroffer.
* There's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, leading to potentially a higher price in the next round.
* Buying from John would cost $100, so this offer is still a better deal."
