"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is more reasonable for me.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to my minimum, but $8,750 is still not quite there for me.  If you're truly serious about buying, let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,900 for the product. This is my final offer.",8900.0,Alice,5,
