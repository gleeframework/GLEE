"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to maximize her profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent offer, Alice can likely do better. She knows the product is worth $150 to Bob, and a $100 offer still leaves significant room for negotiation.  Alice has already established a higher price point, and rejecting this offer allows her to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $110? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really aiming for $105. If we can meet in the middle, I think we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. While Alice could continue to try and negotiate for a higher price, there is a risk that Bob will walk away entirely or that the negotiations will drag on too long.  Accepting this offer ensures Alice gets a decent profit and closes the deal without the risk of losing the sale."
