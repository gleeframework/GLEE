{""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price and close to Bob's ideal price range. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob would have to pay John's higher price. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and allows Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price."
