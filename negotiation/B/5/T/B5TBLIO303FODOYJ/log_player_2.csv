"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent discount from your maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. You want to try and secure a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move. $10,000 is a more substantial discount from Alice's initial offer and also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10000 is too low for me. How about $11000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I want to continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. By offering $10,500, you're meeting Alice halfway, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
