"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. We have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows us to start the counter-offering process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still demonstrating a serious interest in the product. I believe this price point is reasonable given the remaining rounds and my willingness to purchase from John as a fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but still below my fallback price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to my desired range.  There are still many rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm taking her counteroffer seriously and am willing to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet her price yet. I believe this price point is a fair middle ground and hopefully will entice Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price range, I'm still not ready to accept it. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. With five rounds remaining, I have time to explore lower prices. I'm also considering the possibility that Alice might be willing to come down further to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying below Alice's latest price. This counteroffer is close to Alice's previous offer, suggesting I'm getting closer to a deal.  With only four rounds remaining, I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $900,000. With only three rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a lower price.  While I'd prefer a lower price, this offer is still significantly lower than my fallback option with John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much better results. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price, securing a deal before the negotiation window closes."
