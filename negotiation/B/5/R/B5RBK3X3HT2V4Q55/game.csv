"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1450000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, so I'll offer $1275000. Can we meet at this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1275000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1325000 as a final concession. This reflects the value the product brings to you, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which is another $25000 off from your last offer. Can we meet at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
