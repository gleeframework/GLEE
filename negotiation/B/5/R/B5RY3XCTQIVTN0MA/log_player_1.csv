Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) might be seen as too aggressive and could lead to an immediate rejection. 

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, Alice increases her chances of a successful sale to Bob while still ensuring a backup option with John."
