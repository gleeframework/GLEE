Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John.

By offering $1,450,000, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  This price is significantly higher than my minimum and closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** This price is below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive for him to buy.
* **Secure a deal:** While I could potentially push for a higher price, I'm balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the certainty of John's offer.

This strategy allows me to potentially secure a high price while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
