Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is unlikely unless one of you changes your valuation.

**Why a High Offer is Strategic**

While it seems counterintuitive, starting with a high offer can be beneficial:

* **Anchoring:**  A high initial price sets a reference point. Even if Bob rejects it, your counter-offers might seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Information Gathering:** Bob's reaction to a high offer can give you insights into his willingness to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You're not starting from a position of weakness, even though you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **High Price:** This price is significantly above both Bob's value and your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""high demand"" attempts to create additional perceived value.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects your initial offer and subsequent counter-offers don't meet your minimum, you're better off selling to John.
* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be ready to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and willingness to engage.
