"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can we meet in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal.  If we can't agree, I will have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
