"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation high, but not exorbitantly so.  It leaves room for potential counteroffers while also clearly communicating the value you believe the product holds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price and even lower than your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). While he shows interest, it's not a good starting point for a negotiation. You have room to negotiate, and potentially squeeze out a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table, and it's worth exploring further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,000,000 mark.  You have a few rounds left, and John's offer serves as a safety net. There's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's finalize this deal.  If we can't agree, I will have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:** 

This counteroffer is your minimum acceptable price and also the price John is willing to pay. It's important to communicate that this is the lowest you're willing to go and that you have alternative options. This puts pressure on Bob to make a decision and potentially accept your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you've already reached your limit, and John is waiting to buy the product at your desired price.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's more secure to accept John's offer and guarantee your minimum target."
