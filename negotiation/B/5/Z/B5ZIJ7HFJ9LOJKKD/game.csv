,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer $102. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best we can do.",102.0,Alice,5,
