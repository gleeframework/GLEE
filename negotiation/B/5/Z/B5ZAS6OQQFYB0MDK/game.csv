"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9000. How about we try $10500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a decent profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $11000? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Alice. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go above $9500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there. Can you seriously consider $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
