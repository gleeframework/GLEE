"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential value and that I'm prepared to move quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to close this deal quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
