"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at the same price, you are indifferent between buying from Alice or John. However, you want to save as much money as possible.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy from John since you know exactly what you're getting and there's no risk involved in Alice potentially raising the price later."
