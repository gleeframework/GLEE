"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum value ($15,000) as possible.  A counteroffer of $11,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,500.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or running out of rounds increases. Accepting the offer at this price is a good deal for Bob, as he is still saving $2,500 compared to buying from John."
