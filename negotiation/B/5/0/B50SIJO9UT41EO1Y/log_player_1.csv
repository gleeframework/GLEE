Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Value-based language:**  The message focuses on the value to Bob, not just the price. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but being too inflexible could lead to Bob rejecting the offer outright."
