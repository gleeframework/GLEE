"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a price that reflects its true worth. My initial offer is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. There's no reason to accept it at this stage. It's better to start negotiations and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I have to consider the value of the product and my target profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $975,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing negotiations for a couple more rounds to see if you can reach an agreement within your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $980,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. With only three rounds left, it's unlikely that you'll be able to convince her to lower the price enough to make it worthwhile for you. 

Therefore, the most financially sound decision is to purchase the product from John for $800,000, as this will guarantee you the product at a price that fits within your budget."
