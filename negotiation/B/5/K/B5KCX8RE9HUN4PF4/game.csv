"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a price that reflects its true worth. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I have to consider the value of the product and my target profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $975,000.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $980,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Alice,7,
