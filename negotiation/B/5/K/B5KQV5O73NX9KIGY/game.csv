"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to squeeze me for a good deal! I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I'm not going any lower. It's a fair price, considering the quality of the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,,
