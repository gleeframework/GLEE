{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. I want to see how Alice reacts to this price, and if she's willing to come down. If she rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess and adjust my counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. There's a chance I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,400,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price. It's a compromise, and hopefully, she'll see that it's a fair price for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice isn't willing to come down significantly on her price.  To avoid further back-and-forth and potential for even higher counteroffers, I'm going to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,500,000."
