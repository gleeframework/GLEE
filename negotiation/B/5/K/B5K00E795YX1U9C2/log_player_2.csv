"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested but $90 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $87.50 is within your budget of $100 and is a good deal considering you're willing to pay up to $100. It's also a decent compromise from her previous offer."
