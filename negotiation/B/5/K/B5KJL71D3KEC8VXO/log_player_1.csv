"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's above what we know Bob values it at. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me a strong position. I don't need to be desperate and can walk away from a bad deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Seriousness:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,400,000 suggests he's seriously interested in the product. It's a significant jump from his perceived value, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $1,400,000 is less than my initial ask, it's still significantly above my minimum and John's offer. There's space to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to guide it toward a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To be honest,  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product can generate significant value, and I'm looking for a price that reflects that potential.  Would you be willing to move to $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm coming down from my initial ask but not drastically. Splitting the difference between Bob's offer and my previous price signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential value to reinforce my pricing stance.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""Would you be willing...""  frames it as an invitation for Bob to consider a higher price, rather than an ultimatum. 
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal. This approach allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,550,000 is a significant profit above my minimum price ($1,200,000) and John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, showing a strong desire for the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Bob away, or result in a smaller increase. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows me to re-invest the capital, potentially earning additional returns."
