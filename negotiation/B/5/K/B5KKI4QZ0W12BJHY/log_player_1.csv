Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price a bit, but I'm confident I can still get at least $100 from him. If he doesn't accept, I can always sell to John for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than Bob values the product, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? That's still a great deal for a product worth so much!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can both agree that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing him by pushing for a higher price. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
