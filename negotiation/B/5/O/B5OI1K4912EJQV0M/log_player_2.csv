"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  There's also a chance he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm really looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500? This would still give you a great value and be fair to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer again.  While it's closer to his desired price, he's still better off buying from John at $12,000. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he might be able to get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still stuck at $12,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can pay.  If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation. While $12,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to make one final compromise. If you're serious about buying the product, I'll accept $14,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure you get a great deal.  However, if you're not ready to commit to this price, I'll have to move forward with John's offer.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He's already made it clear that he's not willing to pay more than $12,000. Alice has offered a final compromise, but it's still above Bob's limit.  He's better off securing the product from John at his desired price, rather than risking further negotiation with Alice."
