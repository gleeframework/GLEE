"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500? This would still give you a great value and be fair to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still stuck at $12,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can pay.  If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your situation. While $12,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to make one final compromise. If you're serious about buying the product, I'll accept $14,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure you get a great deal.  However, if you're not ready to commit to this price, I'll have to move forward with John's offer.  Let me know your decision. ",14000.0,Alice,5,
