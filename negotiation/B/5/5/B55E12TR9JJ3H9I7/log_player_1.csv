Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product.  However, $22,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  Let's see if we can close the deal.
