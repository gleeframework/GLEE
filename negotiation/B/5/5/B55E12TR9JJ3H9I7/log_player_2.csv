"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $22,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's much better to try and negotiate with Alice, or buy from John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product.  However, $22,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his comfort zone. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further. If he can't reach a deal with Alice, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to accept $15,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that he'll be able to get Alice to lower her price further.  It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John for $8,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
