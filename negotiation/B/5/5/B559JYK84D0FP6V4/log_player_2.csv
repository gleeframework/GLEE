"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($80). By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or find a better deal elsewhere, like from John at $150."
