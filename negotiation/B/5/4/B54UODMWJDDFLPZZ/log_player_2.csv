"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range for you. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it, while still offering a good deal compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for you. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another offer and you ending up paying John's much higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer is the safest and most financially beneficial option at this point."
