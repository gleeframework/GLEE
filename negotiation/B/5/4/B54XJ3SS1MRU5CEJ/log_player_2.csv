"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least that much to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's no harm in trying to get a better deal.  You can reject her offer and see if John will sell it to you for less than $120."
