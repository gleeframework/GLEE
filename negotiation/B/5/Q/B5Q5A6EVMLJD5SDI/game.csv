,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make a deal!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $94. This is really my final offer, as I'm confident you'll find this product extremely valuable. Let me know your decision!",94.0,Alice,5,
