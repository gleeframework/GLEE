Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more, increasing my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This makes it seem like a good deal to Bob while still giving me a good profit.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance."
