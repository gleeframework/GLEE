Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  $1,000,000 (this is the price John is willing to pay, so it's my safety net).
* **Bob's maximum price:** $800,000
* **Offer:** $900,000

This offer:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's less than my minimum, but more than Bob's maximum.
* **Maximizes potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I get $100,000 more than if I sell to John.
* **Mitigates risk:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
