Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is far too low.  I'm confident that I can get more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your perspective, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $850,000 is a good price and it's better than selling to John. It's a fair compromise and I'm happy to close the deal."
