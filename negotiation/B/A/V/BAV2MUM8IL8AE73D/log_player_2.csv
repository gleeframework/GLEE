You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000.  This means there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can get closer to our goal of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, while still being above her value. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but also trying to secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than we're willing to pay. It's worth continuing negotiations to try and secure a lower price, especially considering we have several rounds left.  We're also still much lower than John's price, so there's incentive to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from our previous offer, showing that we're willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. We're moving closer to Alice's price, indicating a willingness to reach an agreement, while also ensuring we keep our maximum budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within our budget and is a reasonable price, considering that we are in the 5th round.  We've shown Alice that we are serious about buying the product, and this offer is a good compromise.  Continuing negotiations may lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or us running out of rounds is increasing.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price within our budget."
