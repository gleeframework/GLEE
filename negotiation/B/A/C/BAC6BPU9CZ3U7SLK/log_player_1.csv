Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $149."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim to get as close to that price as possible with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially going slightly higher if he's really interested.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you want to maximize profit, starting at $150 might immediately turn Bob off. Offering a slightly lower price makes you seem more flexible and open to making a deal. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
