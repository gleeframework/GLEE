Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8

# Bob's message: I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made his final offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's getting late in the negotiation process. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
