{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.  I want to see Bob's reaction and gauge his interest before making further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for that price. I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. $175 is still a decent profit for me, but it's also a significant decrease from my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $150. If that works for you, we have a deal.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell it for more, I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and ending up with nothing. Accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
