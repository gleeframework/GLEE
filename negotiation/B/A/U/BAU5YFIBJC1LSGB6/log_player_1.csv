Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without you feeling pressured to accept immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to him, and you have room to negotiate further.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still less than what the product is worth to him, it's a significant increase from his previous offer and very close to my desired range.  Accepting it will guarantee a sale at a decent profit, and further negotiation might not yield a much higher price."
