"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has 7 rounds left and doesn't want to rush into a deal that doesn't maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $10,750. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. $10,750 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to close the deal at $10,900. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Savings:**  He's getting the product for $10,900, saving $1,100 compared to buying from John. 
* **Limited Rounds:** He's in round 5, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away. 
* **Final Offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, suggesting there's a high chance she'll stick to it.

While he might be able to get a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $12,000 from John outweighs the potential for a few hundred dollar saving."
