Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer.  Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:** The offer is still below the $12,000 value he places on the product, meaning he'd still get a good deal.
* **It's a good deal for you:** The offer is significantly higher than your minimum value of $8,000, meaning you'll make a substantial profit. 
* **It's likely to be accepted:** Bob has a strong incentive to accept the offer as he'd still be saving money. 

By offering a price slightly closer to your minimum value, you're running the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. However, it is a good strategy to offer a more attractive price to a potential buyer, which will likely result in a quicker sale."
