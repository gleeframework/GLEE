{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can use the threat of buying from John to leverage a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting by offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. This establishes a clear baseline and puts pressure on Alice to negotiate. I'm using the threat of buying from John to my advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my budget. I'm going to keep rejecting her offers and try to negotiate a price closer to my maximum. It seems like there's room for negotiation, and I can continue to leverage the threat of buying from John to my advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my budget.  A $950,000 price would be a good compromise, potentially allowing me to get a better price than John's offer while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit."
