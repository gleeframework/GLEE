Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, while also acknowledging that Bob might have a different value perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm reducing my price, but still aiming for a value closer to my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also not willing to drastically lower my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with further negotiation.  It's also a significant amount of money, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity."
