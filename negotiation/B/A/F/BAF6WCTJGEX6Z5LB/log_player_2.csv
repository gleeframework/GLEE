"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think it's a great starting point for our discussion.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident in the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be frank, I'm finding it difficult to justify going above $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price point? It would help me finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to finalize the deal quickly, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Accepting the $1,025,000 price saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer ($475,000) and is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
