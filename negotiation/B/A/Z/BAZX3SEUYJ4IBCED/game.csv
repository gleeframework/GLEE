"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  To show my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a compromise on my end.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
