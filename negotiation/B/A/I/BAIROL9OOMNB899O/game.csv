"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, $2,300,000 is reflective of the significant value this product holds.  I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000, but that's a firm offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to agree on a price of $1,750,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
