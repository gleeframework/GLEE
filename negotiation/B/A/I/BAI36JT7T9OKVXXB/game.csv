"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,500 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,800. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want. What do you say?",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm going to counter with $7,600.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this is the final offer I'll make. What do you think?",7600.0,Alice,7,
