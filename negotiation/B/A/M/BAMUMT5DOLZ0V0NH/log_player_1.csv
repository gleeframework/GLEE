"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Establishing value:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price based on the product's value. This is meant to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Opening for dialogue:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, which invites him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not in a rush.  Rejecting the offer gives me an opportunity to:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is serious about the product by counter-offering. 
* **Potentially get a better price:**  I can try to get closer to my initial offer of $150. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting immediately, I show that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives you a good deal, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that this is still a good deal for Bob,  which encourages him to consider accepting.
* **Speed factor:**  Mentioning a quick close can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135, which would be $127.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $127.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Considering that we only have 6 rounds left, it's likely that further negotiations will lead to a lower price. 

Accepting Bob's offer:

* **Guarantees a sale:** I'm ensuring I sell the product, which is important with the time constraint.
* **Minimizes risk:**  Further negotiations could lead to a lower price or even a rejection. 
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $127.50 is a fair compromise considering the initial gap in our offers."
