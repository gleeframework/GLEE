"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can come to a more agreeable price.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a more agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1100000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1100000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you a price of $1080000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
