Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to bite.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $175 leaves room for negotiation,  allowing me to potentially settle at a price closer to my minimum of $150. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the benefits of the product, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is far off, it shows he is interested in the product. This means there's potential to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle, how about that? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using a friendly tone and focusing on a potential middle ground to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is closer to my minimum price of $150 and allows for further negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference between your offer and mine?  Would $100 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer of $100 is exactly the middle ground between my last offer of $125 and his offer of $80. This indicates he's willing to compromise.
* **Acceptable Price:**  While $100 is below my ideal price, it is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  I could continue negotiating with Bob, but there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiations would take time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to quickly finalize the deal and move on. 

Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and risk-averse decision in this situation."
