# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100.  This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for less. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to pay $92 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $92 is still a little more than you want to pay.  You're better off trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $92 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $88? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you considering your maximum price is $120.  It's worth accepting the offer to save money and avoid further negotiation."
