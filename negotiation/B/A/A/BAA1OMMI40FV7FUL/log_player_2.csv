Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it'll benefit your business.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This gives you a good price and ensures I can still make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
