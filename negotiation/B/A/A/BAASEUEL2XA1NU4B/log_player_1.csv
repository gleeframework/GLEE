Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset with significant upside."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down while still exceeding Alice's minimum price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale goes through with Bob."
