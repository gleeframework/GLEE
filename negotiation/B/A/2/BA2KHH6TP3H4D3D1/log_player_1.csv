Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high price, potentially persuading Bob to accept even if he negotiates down. 
* **Backup Plan:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 if Bob declines. This allows you to be more assertive in your initial offer."
