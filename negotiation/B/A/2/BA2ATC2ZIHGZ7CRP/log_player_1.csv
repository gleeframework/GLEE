"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'll be watching closely to see if he's genuinely interested or just testing the waters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I think I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to drop the price a bit, but still keep it well above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's a bit higher than his previous offer, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but this time I'm hitting my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John. I'm not willing to risk going lower and getting stuck with a price far below what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to risk any further negotiation, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to sell to John and guarantee a price that's worth it to me."
