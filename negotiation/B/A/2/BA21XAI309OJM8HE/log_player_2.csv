"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Let's find a win-win situation.  What do you say to $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
* **Your Maximum Value:** $15,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value.  You can get the product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the optimal strategy to maximize your savings."
