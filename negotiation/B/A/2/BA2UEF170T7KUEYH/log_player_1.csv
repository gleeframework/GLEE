Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, leveraging the information you've provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I know this product could benefit you greatly, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while still ensuring you get a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially secure an even higher price. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's exact walk-away price. In real-world negotiations, gathering information about the buyer's constraints and motivations is crucial."
