{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still securing a price significantly higher than your fallback option.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to subtly remind Bob of the worth he places on the product, justifying the high price. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or any time constraints. 
* It's a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and any additional information you gather."
