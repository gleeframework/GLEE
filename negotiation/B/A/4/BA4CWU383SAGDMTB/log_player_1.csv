"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at a high price ($1,000,000) gives us room to negotiate downwards without feeling like we're giving away too much. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's uniqueness and worth helps Bob understand why we're asking for such a high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message conveys that we're open to discussion, which is crucial for a successful negotiation. 
* **Safeguard:**  Knowing we have John's offer of $800,000 gives us a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  $750,000 is below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:** We still have 9 rounds left, which gives us time to negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John is Not Ideal:**  While selling to John guarantees $800,000, there's a chance we can get a higher price from Bob if we continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**  We'll need to counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a little too low for me. This product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth more than that.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $900,000? "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're meeting Bob halfway by offering $900,000, which is a significant drop from our initial price, showing flexibility. 
* **Maintain Value:** We're still emphasizing the product's uniqueness and worth, reminding Bob why it's valued at a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $900,000 leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but it's closer to our minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**  We'll see if Bob accepts our counteroffer. If not, we'll have to assess his next offer and decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $900000. How about $825000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $825,000 is only $25,000 above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Time is a Factor:**  We've already had four rounds, and each round brings us closer to the possibility of having to sell to John. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  It's likely that if we reject Bob's offer, he may not offer anything closer to our minimum in the next round. 

**Next Steps:** We'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This is a good outcome, given our minimum acceptable price and the limited time we have to negotiate."
