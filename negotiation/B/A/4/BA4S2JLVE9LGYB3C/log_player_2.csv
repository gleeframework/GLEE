"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000. I believe you'll find it's a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering a price lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This means there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting, you can potentially get a better deal by either:

* Convincing Alice to lower her price further.
* Negotiating with John to get a lower price from him."
