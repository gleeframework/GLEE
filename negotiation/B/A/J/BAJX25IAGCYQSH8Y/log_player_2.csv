"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $120 from John. While Alice's offer is better than John's, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  It's worth trying to counteroffer and see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $110 and my maximum price of $120. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good deal.  It's a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is within my budget and is better than John's offer of $120. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might reject my next counteroffer and I could end up paying the full $120 to John. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
