Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for $110.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is $105, which is lower than my initial offer of $110, but still higher than my minimum price of $100. Since I want to earn as much as I can for the product, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll increase my price slightly to $108, trying to get closer to the original value of $120 to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $105, I'll increase my price by $3 to $108, as mentioned earlier.

{""product_price"": 108}"
