Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves space for potential negotiation.  He might counter-offer, and you can always go down to a price closer to $10,000. 
* **Confidence:** By starting high and presenting the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you project value and might persuade Bob to pay more than he initially intended. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always send a follow-up message with a lower price, gradually approaching your minimum of $10,000 before going to John."
