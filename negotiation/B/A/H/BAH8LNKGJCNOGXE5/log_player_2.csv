"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that you're serious about buying the product.  It's a common tactic in bargaining to start lower than your actual desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is now closer to your acceptable price, but you can still try to get a better deal. You know John will sell it for $10,000, so there's no need to settle for $10,500 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($8,000) and Alice's current offer ($10,500). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While $9,500 is a good price, it leaves you a little room to negotiate further if Alice counters. 
* **John's Price:** You know you can get it from John for $10,000, so you don't want to go above that."
