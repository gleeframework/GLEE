"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. How about $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I like the fact that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to take a small step back to $1025000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1020000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let's see if we can finally meet in the middle. What do you say?",1020000.0,Alice,9,
