{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $10,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium for a quick and easy transaction. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have the security of John's offer at $8,000. This ensures we don't need to settle for anything less than what the product is worth to us."
