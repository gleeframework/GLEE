Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. However, $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his final offer.  Since John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
