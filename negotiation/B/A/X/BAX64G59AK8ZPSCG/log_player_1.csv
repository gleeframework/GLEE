# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds.
