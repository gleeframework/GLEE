"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($10,000).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. $12,000 is still above the product's worth to Alice, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.  It also provides a starting point for the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but Bob can likely still get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a deal closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest one.  It shows Bob is serious about making a deal, but he's still trying to get a price that benefits him.  $12,500 is still within Bob's budget, but it's significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price."
