"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,450,000 vs $1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,350,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is certainly attractive, I believe this product holds even greater value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($1,400,000 vs $1,200,000). There's still room for negotiation. I'll try to push for a lower price, but if I can't get below $1,350,000 I might consider going with John as I am running out of rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I value your willingness to find common ground.

This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price ($1,390,000 vs $1,350,000). I have a few rounds left, and I'm willing to risk it to try and get closer to my target.  If I can't get below $1,350,000, I might have to consider John, but I'm hopeful I can close a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,390,000. However, to demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,380,000. It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1380000}
