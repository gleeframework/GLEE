Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a bold opening offer, reflecting the product's value to you.  Since Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, he will likely counteroffer.  We'll see what he proposes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident in the product's value. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up in his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I've already established John as a reliable buyer who will pay my desired price. It's time to secure the deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
