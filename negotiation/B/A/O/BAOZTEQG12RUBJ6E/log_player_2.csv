"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $9,500.
* While this is a lower price than John's, it's still more than what the product is worth to you.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or move on to John and pay the maximum you're willing to spend."
