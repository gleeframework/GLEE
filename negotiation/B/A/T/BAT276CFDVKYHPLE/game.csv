"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Given the value of the product, I'd be willing to pay $10500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10800, and that's as low as I can go.",10800.0,Alice,3,
