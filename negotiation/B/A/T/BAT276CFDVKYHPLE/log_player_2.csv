"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I believe you'll love it, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're willing to pay $12,000 at most, and Alice is asking for $11,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so there's a potential for a price that benefits both of you. 
* **You have a fallback option.**  John is willing to sell for $12,000, so you're not in a desperate situation.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10800, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is now offering the product for $10,800.
* **You're saving money.** Compared to John's price of $12,000, you're getting a $1,200 discount.
* **There's a chance the negotiation could break down.**  You could keep trying to bargain, but there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the product altogether."
