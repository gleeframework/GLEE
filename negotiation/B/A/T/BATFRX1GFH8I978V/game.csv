"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500? It's still a good price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,750, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle!",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,600, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",8600.0,Bob,4,
