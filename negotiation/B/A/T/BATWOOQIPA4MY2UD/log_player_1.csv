{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible, while still being attractive to Bob.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my valuation of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  While I understand your valuation, I'm unable to accept $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible, but I'm also being realistic about Bob's willingness to pay. This counteroffer is a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given the fact that I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, I would like to stick to that figure. Perhaps we could find common ground at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his offer is still below my minimum value.  I've made significant concessions already, and it's becoming clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  To maximize my profit, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
