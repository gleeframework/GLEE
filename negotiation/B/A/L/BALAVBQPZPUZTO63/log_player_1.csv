Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, but offering it at $120 leaves no room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, and he might reject it.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at $100 gives Bob a $20 discount (making it attractive) while still giving you a $20 profit over your guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price appealing to Bob and maximizing your potential earnings."
