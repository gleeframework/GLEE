"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $15,000, which reflects the true value of this product.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $13,000 is fair. This is a compromise I'm willing to make, as I believe you'll benefit greatly from it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm trying to keep it closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $10,500? That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
