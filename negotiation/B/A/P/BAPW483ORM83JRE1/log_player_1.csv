Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know how valuable this is to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing you at least $800,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
