Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I want to see if Bob will pay slightly less.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strong starting point. It's just below my guaranteed price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there's room for negotiation if Bob counters. This strategy allows me to potentially secure a higher profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
