# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1,380,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
