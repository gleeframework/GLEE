# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm unfortunately unable to meet your price point at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,250,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in this product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
