"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1350000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1450000. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1350000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $1380000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1375000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1375000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to include a premium support package and a 30-day money-back guarantee. I'm thinking we could meet at $1400000 for the package deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1380000 for the product, and I'll take the premium support package and 30-day money-back guarantee as part of the deal. That's my final offer.",1380000.0,Bob,6,
