"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $22,000 is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial interest."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $16,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to move up slightly. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's land this â€“ how about $14,000? This is my final offer, as holding out for a higher price with another buyer would likely eat up any potential gain at this point."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand that's your final offer and you're firm on the price, however, I'm afraid $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I could stretch to $12,500 as my absolute maximum. Otherwise, I appreciate your time and I'll have to consider exploring other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll move much beyond $12,500. Accepting a price that low loses significant potential profit. Holding out risks him walking away entirely. John provides a guaranteed $15,000, making it the safest and likely most profitable option at this point."
