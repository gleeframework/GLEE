"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll initially reject Alice's offer. There's a chance I can get a lower price by negotiating. I haven't gathered enough information about the product's value to Alice to determine if a counteroffer is worth pursuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and opens the negotiation.  It's important to be bold early on, as I have limited rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $500 lower than my initial price point. This is a reasonable compromise, and  I'm getting closer to my goal of saving money.  Accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and potential risks of Alice rejecting another counteroffer,  especially considering I have limited rounds."
