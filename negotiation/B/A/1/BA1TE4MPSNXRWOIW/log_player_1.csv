Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else.  I think it would be very valuable to you! I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while ensuring I get more than John's offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's inclined, but still guarantees a significant profit above my minimum. 
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning I'm offering it to him before others, I create a sense of urgency that might make Bob act quickly."
