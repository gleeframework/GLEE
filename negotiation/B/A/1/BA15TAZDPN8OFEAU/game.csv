"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value.  Let me know if you're interested. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $950,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $850,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $850,000 is closer,  I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm still not comfortable with $750,000, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it shows my commitment to making this deal work.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
