Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000 to $10,000. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $9,500 is significantly below its value.  To be fair, how about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $15,000?

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go as low as $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? It's a compromise that reflects the true value of this product.
