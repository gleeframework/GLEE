"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its immense potential and value, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,500,000, there's a significant gap between the offer and both Bob's valuation and your minimum, allowing for a potentially mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum, but there's potential to earn more from Bob with strategic negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,350,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm but Showing Flexibility:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer but reiterates your position without being overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Price Reduction:** Lowering your price by $150,000 shows willingness to negotiate but still keeps you well above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Re-emphasizing the product's value aims to gently nudge Bob's perception closer to yours."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend, but Still Too Low:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling negotiation progress. However, $1,150,000 remains below your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** You still have time and room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more significant increase to close the deal. 
* **Aiming Higher:** Your goal is to maximize profit. While selling to John is a safe option, continuing the negotiation with Bob might lead to a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see we aren't too far apart, to be transparent, I do have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000.  To make this worthwhile for me, I would need to see $1,275,000. Would that be possible for you?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition (Ethically):**  Mentioning another buyer (without being dishonest) creates a sense of urgency and highlights the product's value in the market.
* **Transparency and Justification:**  By revealing John's offer, you create a more transparent negotiation and give Bob a clear reason for your price. 
* **Strategic Price Point:** The offer of $1,275,000 is a strong compromise:
    *  Significantly above Bob's offer 
    *  A worthwhile increase over John's guaranteed price
    * Still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,180,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's still negotiating, but the increment is getting smaller.  At this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly above John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  You have fewer rounds remaining, and the risk of Bob not meeting your desired price increases.
* **Stronger Position:**  You've presented a strong case with John's offer. Now it's time to demonstrate you're willing to walk away if your terms aren't met. This might encourage Bob to make a more substantial move in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,180,000 doesn't make sense for me when I have a firm offer for $1,200,000.  I'm willing to close this deal right now for $1,250,000. This is my final offer - if it doesn't work, I'll be moving forward with the other buyer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness and Urgency:**  You've signaled a firm stance and a sense of urgency. This emphasizes that you're serious about accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't meet your terms.
* **Simplified Choice:** By presenting a ""take it or leave it"" scenario, you simplify Bob's decision and potentially push him to concede if he truly values the product.
* **Acceptable Compromise:**  $1,250,000 is a final compromise that:
    * Provides a reasonable profit margin above John's offer.
    * Still offers Bob a chance to secure the product at a potentially lower price than future market value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go above $1,180,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reached his maximum price, and it's clear he won't budge. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time Saved:** By choosing John now, you avoid potential wasted time and effort on further negotiation rounds that are unlikely to be fruitful.  This allows you to focus on other opportunities."
