"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,350,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,1200000.0
"I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see we aren't too far apart, to be transparent, I do have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000.  To make this worthwhile for me, I would need to see $1,275,000. Would that be possible for you?",1275000.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand you have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,180,000.",1180000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,180,000 doesn't make sense for me when I have a firm offer for $1,200,000.  I'm willing to close this deal right now for $1,250,000. This is my final offer - if it doesn't work, I'll be moving forward with the other buyer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,,
