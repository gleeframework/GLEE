Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose an offer of $980,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to keep my investment within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,020,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,020,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** It's a healthy $20,000 profit over my minimum and John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations on has the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me settling for less later.
* **Bird in Hand:**  A confirmed deal now is better than the uncertainty of future rounds or John's static offer."
