"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I think it has potential. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value to you. Considering your initial enthusiasm, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
