Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I think it has potential. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
