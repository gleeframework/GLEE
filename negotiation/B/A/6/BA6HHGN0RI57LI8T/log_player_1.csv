Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Backup Option:** I'm aware I have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer was a significant jump down from my initial price, signaling he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price still provides a good profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  By showing flexibility, I'm encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice. I could do $108 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $108 is a good profit margin, exceeding my minimum price by a decent amount.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield a dollar or two more, and risks pushing Bob away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the potential time and effort of further negotiation rounds."
