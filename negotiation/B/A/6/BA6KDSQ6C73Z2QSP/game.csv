"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm happy to consider buying for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can work with that. However, I need to make sure I'm making a fair profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a steal!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $11,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is my final offer.  If you can't accept it, I'll need to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'll meet you at $11,250, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",11250.0,Alice,5,
