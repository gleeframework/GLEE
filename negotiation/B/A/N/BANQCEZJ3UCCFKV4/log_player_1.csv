{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to capture as much of the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum as possible. 
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a significant potential profit for you ($350,000) while still giving Bob a strong incentive to buy ($150,000 below his valuation).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer attractive enough to accept."
