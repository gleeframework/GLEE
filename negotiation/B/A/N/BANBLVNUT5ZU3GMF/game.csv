"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
