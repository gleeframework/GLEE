Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $900,000 is a reasonable starting point that might entice him.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $1,000,000, so you're leaving room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is simple and gets straight to the point. 

By setting a high initial price, you create room for negotiation. If Bob rejects your offer, you can then consider making counteroffers based on his counteroffers, always keeping in mind your own minimum and the potential to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that's so far off.  

By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my value and still leave room for negotiation.  I'll need to balance my desire to earn the most money with the risk of losing a sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's closer to your value:** $850,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's above Bob's offer:** This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly undercuts your value.
* **It's framed as a compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a way to ""make this happen,"" conveying a willingness to reach a deal. 

This counteroffer demonstrates your commitment to selling the product while also protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  Could you do $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John for $1,000,000.  

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to his offer but still reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:**  $800,000 is the midpoint between your last offer ($850,000) and Bob's latest offer ($750,000). This shows you're willing to meet halfway.
* **It's a win-win:**  While you're giving up some of your desired profit, it's still a significantly better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000. Bob gets a good price, and you secure a sale.
* **It's framed positively:**  The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario and reinforces the value of the product. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually agreeable solution while ensuring you still gain a significant profit."
