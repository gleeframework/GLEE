"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a significant amount for Bob, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a good profit. It's also a good starting point for the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I believe this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly more than what John is offering. It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
