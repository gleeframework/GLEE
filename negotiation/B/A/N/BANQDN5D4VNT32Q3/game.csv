"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $85? It's still a great deal for a product worth $80 to you, and it's closer to my asking price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $82? I think that's the highest I can go.",82.0,Bob,4,
