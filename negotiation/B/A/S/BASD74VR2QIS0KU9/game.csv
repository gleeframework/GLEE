"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase [product name]. I appreciate the value of the product, but based on my budget, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but  $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This recognizes the value of the [product name] while hopefully fitting better within your budget.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I've reviewed your latest proposal of $2,000,000, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget. I believe we could find common ground if we aimed for a price closer to $1,800,000. This acknowledges the value of the [product name] while staying within my financial constraints. I hope this revised proposal is more suitable for discussion.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer to where we need to be, I can't quite make that work. My final offer is $1,900,000.  This represents the absolute lowest I can go while still honoring the value of this product. Let me know your decision.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your persistence and for bringing the offer down to $1,900,000. I appreciate your effort to meet my budgetary needs. However, I am still unable to meet this price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. This acknowledges the value of the [product name] while staying within my financial constraints. I hope this revised proposal will be more favorable for us to move forward.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
