"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a significant profit for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit out of my range, but I'm prepared to go to $900,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking $925,000 is a more realistic price for both of us. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and the minimum I need to make on the sale.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. However,  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about my minimum price. I'm thinking $915,000 is the lowest I can go. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to you and the minimum I need to make on the sale.",915000.0,Alice,7,
