"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider 110 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $110 is still within my budget.  While I'd love to get it for even less, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
