Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but still allows me to make a decent profit.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still a good price for me, and I believe it's reasonable enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low.  Even though I could potentially keep negotiating, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my price.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I reach my minimum value, I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
