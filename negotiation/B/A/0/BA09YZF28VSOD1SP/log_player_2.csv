"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It's a unique opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs and interests. Given its exceptional value, we believe it's worth $15,000 to you. However, I understand budgets and preferences vary, so I'm offering you the chance to secure this item at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive offer tailored to you, and I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above your $15,000 limit. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might prompt her to suggest a lower price closer to your budget."
