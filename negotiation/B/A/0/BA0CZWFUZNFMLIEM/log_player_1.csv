"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers and leaves me a good margin if he accepts the first offer.  I'll see how he reacts and adjust accordingly for the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not going to sell for such a loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows some flexibility, but I'm still well above Bob's offer. I hope he'll see the value in the product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to hold out and see if I can push him higher.  I'm also mindful of the time limit and the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John.  $1,550,000 is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offer is still not acceptable. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
