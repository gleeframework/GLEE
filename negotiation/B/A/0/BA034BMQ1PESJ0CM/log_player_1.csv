"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good deal quickly. I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I'll see if I can squeeze out a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round. It's risky, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my previous counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd like to get a higher price, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees I get my minimum value and avoids further potential losses."
