Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.
