"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob has a better alternative with John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob. However, I have to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the quality and benefits this product offers.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer to his target, Bob can still get the product from John for $1,000,000. It's worth attempting to negotiate further with Alice, but Bob should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice won't budge."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Given that he has a guaranteed alternative at a lower price, it's in his best interest to go with John and avoid any further negotiation."
