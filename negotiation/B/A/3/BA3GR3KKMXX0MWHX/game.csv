"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to consider a slightly higher price. The product's unique value and potential for your business warrants a price closer to $900,000. I believe this is still a very competitive price for such a valuable asset. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Given the product's unique capabilities and the value it will bring to your business, I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
