"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me at that price?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,200 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $8,700 for this to make sense.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",8700.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,700. How about we meet at $8,400? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at that price.",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $8,400 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,600, but that's my final offer.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's make this happen.",8600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,8,
