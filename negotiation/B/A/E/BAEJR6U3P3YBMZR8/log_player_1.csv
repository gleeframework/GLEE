Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $170. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a decent profit margin, as the product is worth at least $150 to me.  I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, giving us a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It is below my minimum value of $150. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 140}

I'm lowering my price to $140. This is still above Bob's offer of $120, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves me with a decent profit margin, as the product is worth at least $150 to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob has come up to $130, it is still below my minimum value of $150.  While I'd like to make a profit,  it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to guarantee a sale and a reasonable profit."
