"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $130, so it makes sense to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $110 is still a fair price for me, considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still below Alice's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also trying to stay within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. Since John is offering the product at my maximum price, it makes sense to buy from him and end the negotiation with Alice."
