"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's message is vague and doesn't give any concrete information about the product's value to you. 
* Her offer of $100 is still $20 more than your maximum budget. 
* By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down in price.  You always have the fallback option of buying from John for $120."
