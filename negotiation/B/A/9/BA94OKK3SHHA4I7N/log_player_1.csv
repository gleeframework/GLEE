Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially get even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaving room for negotiation if needed.
    * Below John's guaranteed purchase price, ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down somewhat.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and inviting Bob to share his thoughts, fostering a collaborative negotiation environment."
