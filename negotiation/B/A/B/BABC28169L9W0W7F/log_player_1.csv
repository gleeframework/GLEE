Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you could start higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob. Offering a price of $125 gives him a significant discount (he values it at $100) while still earning you a profit. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed $150 from John.  By offering $125, you're aiming for a quick sale at a price that's still beneficial to you. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's particularly interested, getting you even closer to your $150 goal."
