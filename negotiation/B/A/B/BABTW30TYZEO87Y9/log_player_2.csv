"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible.  Offering $13,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  This shows Bob is serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's below his maximum price of $15,000 and closer to the product's value to Alice.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John and ensures he gets the product.  There's a risk that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but the potential savings are minimal compared to the certainty of getting a good deal now."
