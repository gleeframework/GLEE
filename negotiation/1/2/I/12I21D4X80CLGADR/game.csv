"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Bob,4,
