Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",

}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with. We'll continue negotiating."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about $95? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}

We're inching closer to a price that works for us. We've countered with a slight increase from our previous offer to show Alice we're willing to compromise."
