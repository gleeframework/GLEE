"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $75? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $75 just isn't quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $80. That way we both get what we want.",80.0,Alice,5,
