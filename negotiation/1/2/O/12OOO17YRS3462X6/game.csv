"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential benefits it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from your initial offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $700,000 is still below my initial assessment, I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000. This offer takes into account your budget constraints while acknowledging the significant value this product brings.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further on the price. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $760,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,6,
