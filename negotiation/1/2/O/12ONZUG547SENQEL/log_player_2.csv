"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This price is below my maximum budget, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Alice might be willing to compromise to close the deal, especially since she values the product at $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a lower price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below my maximum budget. I believe this price demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. I'm hoping that this move will encourage Alice to accept or make a counteroffer that's closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm only halfway through the negotiation rounds. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but still keeping it well below Alice's latest offer and my maximum budget. I'm aiming to show Alice that I'm willing to compromise and that I'm serious about making a deal. I believe this offer will be more appealing to Alice than the previous one, and could lead to her accepting or making a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offers are still stubbornly high. While I'm confident I could potentially get a lower price, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue. I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate, and it's unlikely Alice will significantly drop her price. 

I'm now at a point where the risk of not getting a deal with Alice outweighs the potential savings. John's offer of $1,000,000 is within my budget and guarantees me the product. It's the most sensible decision at this stage."
