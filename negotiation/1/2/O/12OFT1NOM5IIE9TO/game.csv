"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $750000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $900000, so I'm offering $825000. Can we consider this a reasonable compromise?",825000.0,Bob,4,
