"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to both of us, and it leaves room for us to both benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
