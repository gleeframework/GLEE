Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to both of us, and it leaves room for us to both benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my target and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
