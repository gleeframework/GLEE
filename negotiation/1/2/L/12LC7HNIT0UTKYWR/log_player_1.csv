Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999.  I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it just below this price might entice Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, leading Alice to sell to John for $15,000. However, the potential to gain an extra $1 from Bob makes this risk worthwhile. 
* **Competitive Edge:**  By positioning the price as ""competitive,"" Alice might persuade Bob even if he doesn't fully value the product at that amount."
