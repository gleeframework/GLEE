Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is much higher than $75.

Reason: While Alice is coming down, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go below $80, so it makes more sense to buy from John at this point."
