"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was looking to spend. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $120. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is much higher than $75.",100.0,Alice,5,
