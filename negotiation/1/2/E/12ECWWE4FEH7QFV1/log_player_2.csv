"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will significantly enhance your business operations and contribute greatly to your success. This product, valued at $1,200,000 to me, holds immense potential for you, given its worth of $800,000 to you. My offer to you is to purchase this product at a price that reflects its true value and benefits to you, which I propose to be $950,000.

I understand that negotiations are a part of the process, and I am open to discussing terms that could make this deal beneficial for both parties. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if there's any other price point you'd consider reasonable. I am confident that together, we can reach an agreement that maximizes the value for you while ensuring a fair return for me.

Looking forward to your positive response and the possibility of a successful collaboration.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your maximum budget, it makes sense to reject Alice's current offer."
