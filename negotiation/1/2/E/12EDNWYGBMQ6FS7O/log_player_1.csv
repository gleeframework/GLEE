"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This sets a high expectation and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Unknown:**  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I need to gauge his interest with a price that is potentially enticing but leaves me room to lower it if needed.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If the negotiation fails, I can still secure a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  There's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation and demonstrates that I am not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Potential Counter-Offer:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our expectations. 

**Next Round:**  I will counter-offer with a price that is slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit greater than my minimum.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  This counter-offer indicates that I'm open to negotiation and willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  It also puts the ball back in Bob's court, potentially encouraging him to increase his offer further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a favorable deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to carefully assess Bob's likely counter-offer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, and it provides a profit of $250,000.
* **Limited Time:**  We are already in Round 4, and time is running out.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there is a risk that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant opportunity cost.

**Next Steps:**

* **Close the Deal:**  I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale of the product."
