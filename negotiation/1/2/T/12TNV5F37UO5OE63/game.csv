"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be totally transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  To make this work for me, I'd need to be at that price point. Would you be willing to meet me there?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns and the value you place on the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
