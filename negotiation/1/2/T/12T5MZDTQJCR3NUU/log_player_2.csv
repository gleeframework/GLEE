# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can potentially save more money than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is now within your budget and close to what you're willing to pay.  Accepting the offer means a smaller savings than buying from John, but it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially increasing the price."
