"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product goes beyond that, especially considering its potential for growth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still feel that $1,025,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to ensure it's within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $985,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $985,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",975000.0,Bob,6,
