"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,250,000.  That's still a great price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $1,250,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  I'm confident this price is still fair for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, which is still a compromise, but closer to my original price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $1,320,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get to $1,280,000.  That would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. My next offer is $1,290,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the concessions I've made so far.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
