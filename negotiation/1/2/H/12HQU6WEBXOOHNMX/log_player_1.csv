"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me. I'm hoping that Bob is serious about buying the product and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm determined to get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,300,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than John's offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than selling to John, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I believe we can still reach a deal that benefits both of us. With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic and aim for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob into accepting. With only three rounds left, I need to be realistic about what I can achieve, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as John's offer. I'm not going to risk losing the deal by rejecting Bob's offer and trying to get a better price in the next round. I've already lowered my price significantly, and there's no guarantee that Bob will accept a higher counteroffer. It's better to take the sure thing and accept Bob's offer."
