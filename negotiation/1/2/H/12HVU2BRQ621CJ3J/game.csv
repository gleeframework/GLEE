,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $90? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price we can both be happy with.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for us both.  Let's split the difference. How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",85.0,Alice,5,
