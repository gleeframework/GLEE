Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so a price lower than that would be appealing to him.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $10,000 gives you a profit of $2,000 and leaves Bob with a perceived gain of $2,000. This price point aims to maximize your profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
