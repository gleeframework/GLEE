"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand you have a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $11,000? That's closer to what I had in mind.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the lowest I can go is $15,000. This is a final offer - it's a great deal for this product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
