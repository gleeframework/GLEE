Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  I'm aiming for a higher price and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,800 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept $10,500, I still believe I can get a bit closer to my desired price point.  We've already gone through several rounds, and it's possible Bob is willing to budge a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling a bit stuck at this point.  $10,500 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference at $10,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300

This is getting too close to my minimum price point, and I'm worried Bob might be playing hardball.  It's better to secure the $10,000 from John and move on."
