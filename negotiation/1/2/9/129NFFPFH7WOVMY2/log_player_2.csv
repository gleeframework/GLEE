"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Maximize savings and get the product for less than $100. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $90 is still above Bob's maximum value.
* **Next Steps:** By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice and explore if a deal is possible. There are still rounds left, and it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get the product for as close to $80 as possible.
* **Starting Point:** A $5 discount from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. 
* **Strategic Consideration:** A lower offer might make Alice more hesitant, but it also increases the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get the product for under $100.
* **Alice's Offer:** $92 is still above Bob's maximum value.
* **Next Steps:**  Even though Alice is going up in price, Bob should continue negotiating.  It's possible she might be willing to go lower, or Bob might be able to reach a compromise in future rounds.

It's important to note that if the negotiations continue to stall,  Bob should consider buying from John as a backup option to ensure he gets the product."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Get the product for under $90.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $92 is still above Bob's budget, but she has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Counteroffer:** By offering $88, Bob is signaling his willingness to negotiate but maintaining a firm stance on his budget.  
* **Strategic Consideration:**  This offer is closer to Alice's potential lowest price, but also leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $95 is significantly higher than Bob's initial goal. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Alice's offer is going up instead of down, suggesting she is not willing to compromise further.
* **Time Constraint:** The negotiation is already halfway through, and there's no guarantee a better price will be achieved.
* **Backup Option:** John offers a guaranteed deal at $100, which is still within Bob's budget.  

By choosing ""BuyFromJhon"", Bob secures the product for a price that's acceptable, even though it's not his ideal price. He avoids further negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome, and he doesn't risk the possibility of running out of rounds before reaching an agreement."
