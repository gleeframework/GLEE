"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $120?  That would be fair to both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
