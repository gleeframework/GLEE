Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's potential value to Bob without revealing too much about my own valuation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth further negotiation.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll either make a counter-counteroffer or  move on to John.
* If his counteroffer is close to my minimum, I'll likely accept it to avoid further negotiations."
