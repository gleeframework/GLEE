Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point. It's below my minimum but still significantly above Bob's perceived value.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
