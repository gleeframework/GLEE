"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it can greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,150,000, a price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's close to my maximum budget, and I want to try and negotiate a better price. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible.  I've offered a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my ideal price, but it's still too high.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a better compromise. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price, so I'm also willing to move a little bit closer to hers. Offering $1,100,000 is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that this offer is within Alice's acceptable range, and it leaves me with a good deal."
