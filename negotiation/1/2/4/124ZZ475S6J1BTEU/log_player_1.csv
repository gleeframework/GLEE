Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
