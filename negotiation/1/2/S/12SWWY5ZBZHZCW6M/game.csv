,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal on a product you clearly value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $920,000, which is closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Bob,4,
