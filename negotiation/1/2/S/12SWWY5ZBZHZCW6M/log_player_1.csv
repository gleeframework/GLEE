{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit, while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal on a product you clearly value."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $920,000, which is closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial offer and still significantly more profitable than selling to John."
