"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still above his budget. It makes more sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit out of your range, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge. If not, he'll be better off buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still only able to go as high as $1,000,000.  This is my very final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is $1,150,000 which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, Bob should buy the product from John."
