"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, you know you can get it for $10,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better deal."
