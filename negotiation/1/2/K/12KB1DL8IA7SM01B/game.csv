"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,150,000. This reflects my strong belief in the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a better deal.  Let's try $1,100,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome and ensures a smooth transaction. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
