Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low. How about $90? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $87.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $90.  I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $89? It's just a little bit more than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. How about $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that I'm getting too close to the end of the negotiation rounds and risk not selling the product at all.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and is the best option at this point."
