"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is far above Bob's limit, and he can get the product for a much lower price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming for a middle ground between his maximum and Alice's initial price. $1,000,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her first offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob should counter with $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise that's still below his maximum price and could potentially be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her previous offers, it is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and it is still higher than what he can buy the product for from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate by counteroffering with a slightly higher price than his previous offer, but still lower than Alice's offer. This shows his willingness to compromise while remaining within his budget. $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise and might entice Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum. It's clear that Alice is not willing to meet Bob's price, and there is a good chance that they won't be able to reach an agreement.  It's better to buy from John and ensure he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
