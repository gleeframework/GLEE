"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not quite comfortable with $10,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
