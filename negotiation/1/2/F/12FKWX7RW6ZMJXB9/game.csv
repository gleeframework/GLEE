"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to sell it for a significant profit. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start at $650,000 and see where we go from there?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can do $900,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that the product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming back to me. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $900,000. How about we try $862,500? That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",862500.0,Alice,5,
