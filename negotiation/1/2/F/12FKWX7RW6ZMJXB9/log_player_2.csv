"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to sell it for a significant profit. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can do $900,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that the product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $900,000. How about we try $862,500? That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $862,500, and while getting the product for a bit less would be ideal, John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 is a better option than risking Alice holding firm on a higher price."
