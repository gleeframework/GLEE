"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that allows me to earn a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further.",13000.0,Alice,1,
