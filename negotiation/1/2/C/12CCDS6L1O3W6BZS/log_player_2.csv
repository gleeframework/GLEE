Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested in buying the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I want to try to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is getting close to my counteroffer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my next offer and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer allows me to get the product for a good price and avoid further negotiation."
