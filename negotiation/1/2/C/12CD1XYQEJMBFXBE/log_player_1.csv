Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high (e.g., $30,000) is likely to make Bob immediately disengage without even attempting to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might accept this initial offer. If you want to leave more room for negotiation, you could start slightly lower (e.g., $17,000-$18,000)."
