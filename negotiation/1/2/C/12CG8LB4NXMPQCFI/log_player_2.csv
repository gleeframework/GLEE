"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly cheaper than John's $1,500,000 offer.  It makes the most financial sense to accept her offer."
