Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  It's  a fair bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still well below the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
