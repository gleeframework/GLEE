{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation. I'm also expressing confidence in the deal's attractiveness to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I won't settle for significantly less than my minimum. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  It's  a fair bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still well below the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's worth a lot to both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 812500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal for both of us, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $800,000, my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it matches what I can get from John.  Accepting this offer means I don't have to risk a further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
