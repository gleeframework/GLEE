"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I've done some research and I'm not sure if it's worth that much more than what I'm willing to pay.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I'm not sure if this one is worth that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
