"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree the product is valuable, that initial offer is quite high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents significant value, but $1,800,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay.  To keep this moving, I can offer $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I need to see a more serious offer to continue this discussion.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, but this is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
