Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $150 to Bob. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $130, I can potentially negotiate down to $120 or $125 while still getting a good profit.
* **John as a Backup:**  The presence of John, who is willing to buy for $100, gives me a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John and still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Higher:** While $110 is still a decent profit, I believe I can do better.  Bob clearly values the product at $150, so there's still room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive.  By rejecting, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for his initial counteroffer and that I expect a higher price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Remember, I can always fall back to John for $100, so I don't need to accept a price I feel is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a good deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down from my initial $130 to $120. This shows a willingness to negotiate and avoids a stalemate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him ($150), implying that $120 is still a great price for him.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** While I'm not accepting his initial offer, I'm leaving the door open for further discussion. This avoids a quick ""no"" from Bob and keeps the conversation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $100 (remember, John is willing to pay $100).
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a stalemate where Bob refuses to budge, and I'd be forced to sell to John for less.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'm keeping a positive relationship with him.  This could lead to future business opportunities where I might be able to sell him products at a higher price."
