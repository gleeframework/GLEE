"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250.
