Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point that allows for potential negotiation while still being above my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price right away. I'll see if I can get a better price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $85 is close enough to my minimum price and a better deal than selling to John. I'll accept his offer."
