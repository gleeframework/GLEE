"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price point that is mutually beneficial. $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting this offer would allow Bob to acquire the product for a price that's within his budget and saves him $1,200 compared to buying from John. While there might be room for further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially leading to a deal with John at $10,000 outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
