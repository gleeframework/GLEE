"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about $950000? This would be a significant investment for you, but I believe the potential return will be substantial. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
