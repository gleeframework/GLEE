Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without losing too much, ensuring the negotiation process continues.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer as my safety net, so I can always walk away if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $12000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $10,000 is still below my target. 
* **Room for improvement:** Even though Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I will counter with a price closer to $12,000, aiming for a middle ground. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is still a little too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" aspect and the mutual benefit of the deal to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** $11,000 represents a middle ground between our previous offers, increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal.
* **Prepared for rejection:** I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary but am ready to sell to John if the price doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $9,500 is still below my minimum target of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** While Bob is clearly interested, his offer is too low. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer. 
* **Counteroffer potential:** There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range, especially since Bob has shown interest in the product.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $10,500. This price represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm making a final compromise, signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal. This should encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Fair compromise:** Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" emphasizes mutual benefit and reduces the likelihood of outright rejection.
* **Strategic price point:** $10,500 is a strategic price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, potentially leading to a successful outcome.
* **Prepared to walk away:** I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob rejects this counteroffer, as I'm aware of my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. I think this price is fair and would allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** $10,250 is above my minimum of $8,000, so it's profitable.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  This round has gone back and forth for a while, and continuing could risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better price in the next round, and Bob could even walk away.

While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the current situation. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
