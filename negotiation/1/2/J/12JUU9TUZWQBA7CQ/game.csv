"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000 for it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,600,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about $1,350,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to make a deal. To be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,525,000.  This is my final offer. What do you say?",1525000.0,Bob,6,
