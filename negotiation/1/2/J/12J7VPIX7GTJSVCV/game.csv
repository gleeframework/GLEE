"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about $950,000? That's a fair compromise that still leaves you significant room for profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. That's the best I can do.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to come down to $937,500. This is a fair offer that takes both of our needs into account. What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, let's try $925,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us and I think we can close the deal at this price. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",915000.0,Bob,8,
