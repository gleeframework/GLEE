Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I believe it's a fair price considering I could buy it from another seller for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, as you can get it from another seller for $8,000. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, and it's a good compromise. I'd rather secure a sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
