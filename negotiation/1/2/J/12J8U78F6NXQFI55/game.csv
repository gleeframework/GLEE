"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I believe it's a fair price considering I could buy it from another seller for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, as you can get it from another seller for $8,000. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8250.0,Bob,4,
