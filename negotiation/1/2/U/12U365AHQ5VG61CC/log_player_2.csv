Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now at $850,000, which is only $50,000 more than what Bob could buy from John. There are only 3 rounds left. It is likely that Alice won't go lower, and it is risky to keep negotiating.  Bob can save time and secure the product by accepting Alice's offer."
