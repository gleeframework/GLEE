I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely he will reject it.  This will allow me to see what his starting point is and begin the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
