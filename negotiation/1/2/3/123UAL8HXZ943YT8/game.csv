"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $150? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $150 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $165. This is a great compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for such a high-quality item.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $160.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $160, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $170. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for the quality of the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
