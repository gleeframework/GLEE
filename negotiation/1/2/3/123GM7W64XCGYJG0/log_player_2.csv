}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is closer to a reasonable price, I'm still significantly above John's offer. I need to see if Alice is willing to go lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the new offer. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $675,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm willing to go up to $685,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $685,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $685,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate within this range, and I'm still a significant amount below John's offer. It's worth pushing a little further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway on that last offer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $680,000 to close this deal.  This is a fair price that works for both of us."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $680,000. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a bit more to justify the sale. I'm willing to go up to $690,000, but I'm not going to budge any further. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has consistently moved towards a reasonable price, and while $690,000 isn't ideal, it's significantly better than John's $800,000. Accepting at this point secures the deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
