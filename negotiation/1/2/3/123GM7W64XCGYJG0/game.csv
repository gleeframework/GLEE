,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,700000.0
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, thanks for the new offer. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $675,000?",675000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,685000.0
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm willing to go up to $685,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",685000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway on that last offer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $680,000 to close this deal.  This is a fair price that works for both of us.",680000.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $680,000. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a bit more to justify the sale. I'm willing to go up to $690,000, but I'm not going to budge any further. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",690000.0,Alice,7,,
