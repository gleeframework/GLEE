,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll go down to $12500? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12000 to you. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11800 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $12200.  It's just a little closer to my asking price and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",12200.0,Alice,5,
