Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it,  which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
