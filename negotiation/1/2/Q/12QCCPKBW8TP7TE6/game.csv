"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $1200000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1350000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1325000?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1375000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but $1375000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1312500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1312500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1350000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. It's the last offer I'm willing to make, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from another seller. I'm not willing to go any higher than this.",1325000.0,Bob,10,
