Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more negotiating room if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident in the value of the product, and I want to maximize my profits.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired amount. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still getting me closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $920,000 is a good price, and it's much better than the $800,000 I would get from John. It's time to close the deal!"
