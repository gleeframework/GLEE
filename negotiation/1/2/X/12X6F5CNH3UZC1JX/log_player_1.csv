"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $140 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $150.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great product, and I think it's worth the investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
