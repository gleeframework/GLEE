I'm willing to come down to $880,000, which is still a significant value for you considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $860,000 is getting closer, but I'm still at a point where I need to consider the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $870,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my perspective, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",870000.0,Alice,5,
