Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price for him, considering the value of $150 to him, while still giving me a profit above my minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $130. While it's above my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $135. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $132. While I would ideally like more, it's getting close to my initial offer and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $32, which is better than selling to John for $100."
