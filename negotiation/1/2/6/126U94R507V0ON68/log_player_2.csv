"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic price for a product worth $1,500,000 to you.  I'm confident you'll find this offer very attractive, but I understand if it's not quite right for you.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:**  Alice claims to have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the exact value of the product to her. It's unlikely she would accept a deal at her break-even point while negotiating with you.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, you signal that the price is too high. Alice is motivated to sell and might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale entirely. 
* **John is your backup:** You have the security of buying from John at $1,500,000, so you don't risk losing the product altogether.

By rejecting, you might be able to get a better price from Alice, and if not, you can still buy from John."
