"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $20000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I'd like to find a solution that works for both of us. Based on our previous discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $12000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your financial considerations while still reflecting the value of our product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your position and I'd like to offer a compromise. Considering our previous discussions and your budget, I propose a final offer of $10000 for the product. I believe this reflects a fair balance between the value of the product and your financial capacity.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $8000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,6,
