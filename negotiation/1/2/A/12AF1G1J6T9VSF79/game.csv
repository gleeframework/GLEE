"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the best I can do at this time. What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. $875,000 is a good offer, but I'm only able to go up to $860,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $860,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $880,000. This is the best I can do at this time. What are your thoughts?",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $880,000 is closer, but it's still a bit above my budget. I'm ready to finalize this deal right now if we can agree on $870,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward without any further delays. What do you think?",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're eager to finalize the deal, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $870,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $885,000 to feel comfortable. This is my final offer. What are your thoughts?",885000.0,Alice,7,
