"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob can potentially do better. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the best I can do at this time. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he still has room to negotiate. He can potentially get a lower price by continuing the conversation and using the knowledge that John is willing to sell the product for $800,000 as leverage. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and aim for a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. $875,000 is a good offer, but I'm only able to go up to $860,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $860,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $880,000. This is the best I can do at this time. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $880,000 is tempting, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He has 5 rounds left and can use the knowledge of John's offer to push for a lower price.  Additionally, Alice has already moved closer to Bob's target price, indicating that she is willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage and allows him to try and close the deal closer to his goal of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $880,000 is closer, but it's still a bit above my budget. I'm ready to finalize this deal right now if we can agree on $870,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward without any further delays. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 870000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're eager to finalize the deal, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $870,000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $885,000 to feel comfortable. This is my final offer. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a critical point in the negotiation. While $885,000 is closer to his target price than Alice's previous offers, he has only three rounds left.  With each round, the pressure to close the deal increases, and there's a risk of Alice becoming more stubborn. 

It's unlikely that Alice will accept a counteroffer that significantly lowers the price. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $885,000.

Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative of buying the product from John for $800,000, it's the most logical choice at this point.  He can secure the product at his desired price and avoid the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially failing to reach an agreement."
