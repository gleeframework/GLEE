,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $22000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $19500 for it.",19500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $19500, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $21000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I've already met you at $20000 and then compromised further to $20000, and now you're asking me to go back to $18500? I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $20000 and $18500, which is $19250. This is my last offer.",19250.0,Alice,9,
