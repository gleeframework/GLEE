"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth more to me, and I think it's a good value for you too. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price, but I won't accept an offer that is so far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate the effort. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. However, if negotiations continue to stall, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $7,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we settle at $7,200?  That's a significant move on my part, and it shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,200 is getting close to my minimum value, and we are running out of rounds. While I would prefer to get closer to $8,000, there's a risk that Bob might become unwilling to negotiate further or that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of getting nothing.  I'll take the $7,200 now and avoid the potential of losing out completely."
