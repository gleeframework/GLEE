"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob. Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  How about $9,000? That's a fair price considering the value and allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
