"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident the product is worth more, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that price is still a bit higher than I'd like.  Would you be willing to consider $980,000? This is a fair offer considering the current market value.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
