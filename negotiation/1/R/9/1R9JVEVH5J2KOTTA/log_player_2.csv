Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.

**Reasoning:**

We are now at $1,020,000.  Alice is clearly signaling she's nearing her bottom line. While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, the potential savings are becoming minimal. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations falling apart and ending up with John's $1,500,000 price."
