"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me and the potential for negotiation, I'd like to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
