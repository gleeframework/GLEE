"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me and the potential for negotiation, I'd like to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
