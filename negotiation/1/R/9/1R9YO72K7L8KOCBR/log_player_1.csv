``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives you some room for negotiation while still showing that you value the product.  It also provides a clear opening for Bob to make a counteroffer if he is interested.  

Remember, this is just the first step.  You'll need to assess Bob's reaction and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price of $10,000.  While you want to sell the product, accepting his offer would mean losing money.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider it?
