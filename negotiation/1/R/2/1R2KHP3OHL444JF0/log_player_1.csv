{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity and I believe it's a great value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate downwards.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $12,000?  It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $12000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll come up, and I risk losing time. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum, and minimizes risk."
