"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation and potentially get a better price.  Buying from John immediately is not the best choice, as it would mean paying the full $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This reflects the product's value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price point, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  Buying from John at $800,000 is still an option, but it's not the most financially advantageous move at this point."
