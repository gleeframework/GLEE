"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the lowest I can go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,250, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $10,375. It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal now.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,250 was my last offer, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think about buying from John for $12,000",10250.0,Bob,6,
