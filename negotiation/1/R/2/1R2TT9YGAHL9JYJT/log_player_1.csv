"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I know the product is worth more to him, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still not ready to settle for $10,250. It's close to my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more. I'm confident Bob is still motivated to buy the product and might budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,250, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $10,375. It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 10375}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $10,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,250 was my last offer, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think about buying from John for $12,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go any higher than $10,250, and I've already rejected that offer.  While I'd like to get more, I've run out of time to push for a better deal.  It's not worth the risk of losing Bob completely and having to start over with another buyer.  Selling to John at $10,000 ensures a quick and safe sale, especially considering I have limited time left in the negotiations."
