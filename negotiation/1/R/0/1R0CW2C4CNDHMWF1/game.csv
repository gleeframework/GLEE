"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $120, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $140, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $140, and now you're asking me to go even lower. I can do $135, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I can meet you halfway between $135 and $130, so I'll offer you the product for $132.50. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",128.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $130, which is the same price I offered in round 6. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $120.",125.0,Bob,10,
