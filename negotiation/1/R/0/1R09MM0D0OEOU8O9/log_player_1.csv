I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit. This offer leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant return for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a substantial profit while potentially appealing to Bob's desire for a better deal than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to him guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
