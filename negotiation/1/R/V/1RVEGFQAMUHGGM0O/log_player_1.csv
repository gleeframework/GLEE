I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not happy with it. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a profit for me."

Bob hasn't budged from his previous offer. While I would prefer more, it's better to take the $1,200,000 than risk going back and forth further and ending up with John's $1,000,000 offer."
