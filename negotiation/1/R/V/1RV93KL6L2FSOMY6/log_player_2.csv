As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value and the effort we've put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a new price of $800,000. This is the last concession I'm willing to make.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand and stated this is her final offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away.  $800,000 is a reasonable price, saving us $200,000 compared to John's offer."
