"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to consider your offer seriously. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1,150,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal on this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
