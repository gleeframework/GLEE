"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $14,000 isn't terrible, there's room to negotiate. Alice is starting high, and I have leverage knowing I can buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($11,000) signals that I'm serious about getting a better price but leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a polite and open tone, avoiding any language that might offend Alice and derail negotiations. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps gauge how much Alice is willing to move on price. Her response will give me a better understanding of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $14,000 is a fair price, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  I believe this product will bring you a lot of value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but I think there's still room to push.  She came down by $1,000, which is a good sign. However, I'm aiming to stay closer to that $11,000 mark. I'll counteroffer and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $12,000 positions the deal as a compromise. It shows I'm willing to move from my initial offer while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Mentioning ""fair for both of us"" reinforces the collaborative nature of the negotiation and avoids appearing overly aggressive in my pursuit of a lower price.
* **Gauge Her Position:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is truly willing to go lower than $13,000, or if that's close to her bottom line."
