Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $150 offer is a 25% markup from your minimum price, which is a reasonable starting point in many negotiations. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you aim high, starting with $150 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down,  still allowing you to make a profit above your minimum."
