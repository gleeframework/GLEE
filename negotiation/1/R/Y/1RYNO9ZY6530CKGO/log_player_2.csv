**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. Rejecting this offer might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her $1,200,000 valuation.  It's worth seeing if you can save an additional $150,000."
