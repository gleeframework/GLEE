"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
