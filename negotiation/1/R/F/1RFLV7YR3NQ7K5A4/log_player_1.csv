Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I maximize my potential profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer of $800,000 as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting his offer ensures I don't risk losing the sale and ending up with nothing."
