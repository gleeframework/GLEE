"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I know it's worth $80 to you, but I'm hoping you'd be willing to pay a little more. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, and it would save me the hassle of selling it to someone else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  There's no point in spending more than you need to."
