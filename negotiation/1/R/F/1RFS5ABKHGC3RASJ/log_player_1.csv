Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be a great asset.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $20,000, I'm anchoring Bob's perception of the price. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to stay closer to my desired range than if I started at, say, $16,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I know I have John as a safety net, so I can afford to be a bit bolder with my initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I am prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. My strategy is to aim high initially and gradually lower the price, but never going below my minimum of $15,000."
