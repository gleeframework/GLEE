"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its worth to you is $1,500,000, I believe a fair price would be $1,200,000. This way, both of us benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing your maximum budget. While $1,200,000 is less than your absolute limit, there's room to negotiate a better deal."
