"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $9,500. I think it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's a good chance of negotiating a significantly lower price, especially since the product's value to Alice is lower than my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $7,000 is considerably lower than Alice's initial offer, it's a strong starting point for negotiation. It leaves room to work upwards while still being significantly below my $10,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message conveys interest and a desire to find a deal, but it firmly establishes my budget limitations.
* **Strategic:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Her response will provide valuable information for my next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $7,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to negotiate closer to her product's value. However,  $8,750 is still a substantial amount above her $8,000 valuation.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but there's likely still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  I'm proposing a price that matches Alice's known valuation of the product. This signals that I'm aware of its worth and aims for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By offering a price that represents a good deal for her, I'm encouraging Alice to accept quickly. This is especially relevant since I have the option to buy from John at $10,000.
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly reminding her of its value to her, implying it might not be worth holding out for a much higher price."
