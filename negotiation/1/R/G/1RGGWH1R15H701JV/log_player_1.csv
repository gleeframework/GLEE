Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a win-win situation.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value while leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to ensure a successful negotiation. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, but it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially securing a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but higher than Bob's offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.  A good counteroffer might be $1,125,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,125,000 is my best price. It's still a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,075,000). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  The price is still significantly higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you get a good return on the product.
* **Encouraging a deal:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob and encourages him to consider your offer.

This counteroffer is a balanced approach, aiming to secure a favorable deal while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  Could you do $1,100,000?  That's a very strong offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to your previous counteroffer of $1,125,000. Accepting his offer will secure a sale at a price that is still above your minimum and leaves room for a decent profit. 

**Why not counteroffer again?**

* **Risk of stalemate:**  Continuing to counteroffer could lead to a stalemate, where neither of you are willing to budge. This could result in you having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time is money:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it is that something could happen (like John changing his mind) that could jeopardize your sale.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this point. It secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of a more drawn-out negotiation."
