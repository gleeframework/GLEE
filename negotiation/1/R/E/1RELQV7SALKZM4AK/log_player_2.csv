# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's a steal. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. That's a significant discount from its true value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?
