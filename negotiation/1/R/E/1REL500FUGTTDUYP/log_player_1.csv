I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my valuation of the product.  Let's see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is now at the minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal."
