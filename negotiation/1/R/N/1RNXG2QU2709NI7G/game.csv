"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,500, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table.",11500.0,Alice,3,
