"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is still below the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a revised price of $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,5,
