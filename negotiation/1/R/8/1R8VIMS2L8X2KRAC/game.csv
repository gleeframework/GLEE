"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which I believe is a reasonable price considering its worth to me is $800000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me is $800000. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll need to consider buying from John for $800000. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
