Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to, but still secures a significant profit for me.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
