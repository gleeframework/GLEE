Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120 price point:**  This is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, which gives me some flexibility.
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to be friendly and encouraging to increase Bob's chances of accepting.

**Strategy:** 

By starting with a lower price, I'm hoping to get Bob to make a counteroffer.  If he rejects my initial offer, I'll be ready to counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150).  However, I'll always have the option to walk away and sell to John if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counter with a higher price:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my minimum, potentially leading to a more profitable deal.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to accept my offer. 

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with $102.50, I'm hoping to reach a compromise with Bob. This price is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer, but I'll also keep the option to sell to John in mind."
