You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $90 is a good price, it's worth seeing if I can get it for even less. I'll start by rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm!  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  I'd be willing to buy it for $80.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $85. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $85, which is within my budget and a good deal. I'm willing to accept her offer rather than risk losing the product and having to buy from John for a higher price."
