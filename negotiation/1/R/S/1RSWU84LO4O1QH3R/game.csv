"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I think $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that last offer doesn't quite work for me.  To be honest,  $1,000,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say, do we have a deal?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
