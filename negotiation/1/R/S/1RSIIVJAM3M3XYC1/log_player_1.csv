Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This price is closer to my ideal outcome, but still attractive to Bob, as it's significantly lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm still confident I can get a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept, especially given that he initially offered $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm not going to settle for $920,000, especially with only six rounds left before I have to decide whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $935,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 935000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still a bit higher.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway, as we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $915,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not going to settle for $915,000, especially since we only have four rounds left before I have to decide whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution, and I appreciate that.  However, $915,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we settle on $925,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still a bit higher.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway, as we are now down to only 3 rounds before I have to make a decision."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $800,000. 

While I was hoping to get closer to my ideal price with Bob, we're down to the final two rounds, and I don't believe there's enough time to reach an agreement with him that's more favorable than John's offer.  Selling to John guarantees me a minimum profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
