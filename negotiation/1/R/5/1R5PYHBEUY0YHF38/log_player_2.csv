"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room to negotiate since you value the product at $1,000,000 and she's willing to sell for $800,000."

Alice has come down in price, but it's still too high.  You are closer to your desired price point, but there's still room to negotiate and get an even better deal.  You can counter-offer again and see if you can get closer to $850,000."
