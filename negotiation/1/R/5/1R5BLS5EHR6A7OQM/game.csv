"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $13,500? I think this is a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $13,500 is closer, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense for me. What about $14,250? I'm confident you won't find this kind of value elsewhere.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,750? I think this is the highest I can go without going over my budget.",13750.0,Bob,6,
