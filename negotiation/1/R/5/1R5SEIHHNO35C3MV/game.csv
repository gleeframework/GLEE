"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,300,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 doesn't cover the value I place on this product. Let's split the difference - $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
