# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since he can buy the product from John for $10,000, accepting Alice's offer of $10,500 would cost him more.  Rejecting Alice's offer is the best option in this scenario."
