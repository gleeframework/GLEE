"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $850,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While $920,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount to make this work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  I'm confident that this is a fair price that will allow us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer in this range.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $915,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $905,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",905000.0,Bob,6,
