"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1400000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1250000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1350000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1300000? This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $1320000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
