Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product without being too aggressive. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A $14,000 sale is closer to my minimum goal of $15,000 than Bob's $12,000 valuation.
* **Open the door for negotiation:**  The message acknowledges the possibility of a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth process.
* **Maintain a backup option:**  The threat of selling to John for $15,000 provides leverage if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for your product. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum goal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's still below my ideal value. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore further before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Leveraging the threat of John:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I subtly reinforce my willingness to sell to John for a higher price, giving Bob a stronger incentive to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good value for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm proposing a price of $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still securing a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Positive message:**  My message is still friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in completely. By rejecting Bob's offer and offering a counter-proposal, I maintain a sense of control and demonstrate my commitment to a fair deal.
* **Keeping the option open:**  The message also indirectly reminds Bob that I have another buyer (John) waiting in the wings, reinforcing my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $13,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high, as he's shown a reluctance to compromise.
* **Securing a better deal:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While a $13,000 sale would have been a decent outcome, my goal was to earn as much as possible.  Given Bob's inflexibility and the availability of a higher-paying buyer, selling to John is the most sensible choice."
