"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for me to potentially earn closer to my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $15,500.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also indicates I still believe the product is worth more.  This keeps the negotiation moving while putting me in a good position for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best offer I've gotten from Bob, and it's very close to my ideal price of $15,000. Since I'm running out of rounds and John is willing to pay my full price, it's a good idea to close this deal with Bob to secure a sale."
