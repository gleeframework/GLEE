Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob might scare him off.  
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value, we subtly nudge Bob towards a decision.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while not pricing him so high that he walks away, leading you to sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
