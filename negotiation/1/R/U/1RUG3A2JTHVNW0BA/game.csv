"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well below what others would pay for this product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still looking to keep my spending under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get the product you want while I still get a reasonable return.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $85?",85.0,Bob,6,
