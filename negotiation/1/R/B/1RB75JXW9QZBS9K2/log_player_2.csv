Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,250. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $9,150. It's a bit higher than my target, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for several rounds, and while the price is getting closer to his target, it's still above his maximum. At this point, with only three rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal falling through. Bob should take the guaranteed deal from John and buy the product for $8,000."
