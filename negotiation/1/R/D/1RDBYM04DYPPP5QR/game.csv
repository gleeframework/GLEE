,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we settle on $1,100,000?  This price still allows you to make a great return on your investment while ensuring I can cover my costs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
