Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder in your offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain (his value - your price).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential value"" and ""significant benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of what he gains, making the price more palatable.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's personality, you might adjust the price slightly.
