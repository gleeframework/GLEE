"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be very valuable to you as well. I'm starting with an offer of $25000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's potential to negotiate a much lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and see if you can get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer sets a clear boundary and demonstrates your willingness to negotiate. By offering your maximum budget, you show your serious interest while also leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $20000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $20,000 is still outside your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  By rejecting, you can continue to put pressure on Alice and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20,000 is still too much for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a deal but also acknowledges Alice's need to make a profit. 
* **Significant drop:**  By offering $12,000, you're making a significant drop from Alice's last offer. This demonstrates your commitment to finding a middle ground. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for continued dialogue and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $14000 as a final offer. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can get to your price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget, but closer to your maximum. There's potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to your target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to go above $10,000.  It's a fair compromise considering your last offer and my budget. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Stating this is your final offer adds pressure and implies you're ready to walk away if necessary.
* **Fair compromise:** You're offering a price halfway between your previous offer and Alice's last offer. This shows a genuine attempt to reach a middle ground.
* **Clear decision time:**  You're asking Alice to make a decision, making it clear you're not going to keep going back and forth indefinitely."
