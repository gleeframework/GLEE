"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential to benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  We can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and the offer is now at $1,100,000, which is closer to my target price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer saves me $400,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely or ending up with a price closer to John's.  Therefore, accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point."
