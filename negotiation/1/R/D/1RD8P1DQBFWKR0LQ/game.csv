"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,000. I'm still a bit hesitant, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,750. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $10,875. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
