Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product, emphasizing its unique features or benefits]. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate.  
* **Focus on value:**  The message highlights the product's value to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation, indicating that I'm willing to discuss the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more. 

* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going. I want to see if I can secure a higher price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at the minimum price. This might encourage Bob to come up with a better counteroffer.
* **No urgency:** Selling to John immediately would be safe, but it limits my potential profit. 

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to settle closer to my original price of $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would allow both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and value:** My counteroffer demonstrates willingness to compromise while still valuing the product. Offering $9,000 is a good middle ground.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason behind the counteroffer (meeting in the middle) makes it seem more logical and fair.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, hoping to reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, can we meet at $8500? I really like the product and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $8,000, and it's closer to my preferred price than my previous counteroffer.  

* **Negotiation progress:**  Bob's offer shows he's serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Time factor:**  Further negotiation could take more time, and I'm not sure if it would lead to a significantly higher price.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $8,500 is a fair price for both parties. 

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a reasonable profit without risking further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
