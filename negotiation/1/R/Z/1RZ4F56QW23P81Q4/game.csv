"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,150,000. This price would be fair for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a beneficial transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
