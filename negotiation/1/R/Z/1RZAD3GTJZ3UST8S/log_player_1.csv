{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This price is a compromise between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). It's a starting point that allows for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob. It also avoids setting a hard limit, keeping the negotiation open.

This offer gives me a good chance of making a sale while also leaving room for further negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's worth pushing for a better price, especially considering John is willing to pay my minimum. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired value. It shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and positive, highlighting the discount offered while still expressing my desire for a fair price. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to accept the offer, while also keeping the option open to sell to John if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,200 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still considerably less than what John is willing to pay.  Considering the negotiation has already taken a few rounds and Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, I'm better off cutting my losses and selling to John for my desired price.  This ensures I maximize my profit and avoid any further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
