"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and the potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While there's still potential to negotiate further, accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
