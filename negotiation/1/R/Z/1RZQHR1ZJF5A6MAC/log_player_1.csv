Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Extreme Offers:** Starting too high (close to $120) might scare Bob off. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while still giving you a strong profit margin."
