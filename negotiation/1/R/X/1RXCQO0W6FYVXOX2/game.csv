"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $10,000? That's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering our previous offers, I'll make a new counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
