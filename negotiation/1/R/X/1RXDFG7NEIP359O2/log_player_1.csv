Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""value"" and ""potential"" without being overly specific, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  The tone is open for discussion. If Bob counters, we can potentially still settle above our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one potential strategy. There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, given the information we have, it presents a strong starting point to maximize potential earnings."
