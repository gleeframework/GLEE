"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1,375,000 is still a bit high. Let's split the difference and go with $1,337,500.  This feels like a fair price point for both of us.",1337500.0,Bob,4,
