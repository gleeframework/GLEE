Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to close the deal,  $950,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers are still too low, and I'm getting concerned that I won't be able to get a price close to my minimum.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk ending up with less from Bob."
