"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique and valuable product to you. Given its worth to us, we believe it would be a significant asset to you as well, considering its value to you is $10,000. We are offering this exceptional opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents a great value for both parties and an excellent chance to secure a high-quality item at a competitive price. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. We look forward to potentially working with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further. If she doesn't, you're still securing the best price from John."
