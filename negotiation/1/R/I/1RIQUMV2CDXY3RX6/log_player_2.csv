"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is lower than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's budget. He should counteroffer again and see if he can negotiate a price closer to his limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to part with it for $15,500.  This offer stands, but I am also open to hearing your thoughts.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's budget. Buying from John is a guaranteed deal within Bob's price range, saving him money and time."
