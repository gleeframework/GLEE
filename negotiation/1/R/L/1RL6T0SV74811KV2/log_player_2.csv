"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is less than what John is selling it for, you can likely get a better price from Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a good price considering your willingness to pay up to $150. Accepting this offer saves you $40 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might get you a slightly lower price, but it's unlikely to be worth the additional time and effort."
