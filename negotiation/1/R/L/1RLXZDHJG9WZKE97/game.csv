"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the price point is a little high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
