"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $11,000 is below my initial price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  This offer is closer to your last proposal, and it allows me to cover my costs while still leaving some room for profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $13,000?  That's the best I can do.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $13,250.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal. Let's make this happen!",13250.0,Alice,7,
