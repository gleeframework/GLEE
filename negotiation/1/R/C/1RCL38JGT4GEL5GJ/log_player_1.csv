prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 to be made if you can sell it to Bob for a price between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000.

**The Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:** $1,150,000 secures a significant portion of the potential profit for you while still offering Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to hesitate. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could experiment with different prices within the range to see how Bob responds. However, starting with a strong offer that leans towards your desired profit is generally a good strategy."
