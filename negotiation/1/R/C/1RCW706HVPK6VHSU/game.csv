"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations by offering it to you at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I believe the product is good, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Could you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and settle at $937,500? This would represent a significant saving for you while still reflecting the product's value.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to move a little bit, how about $920,000?  That's my final offer.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I understand this is your final offer, and I'm willing to make one more compromise to seal the deal. How about $925,000?  This is the best I can do.",925000.0,Alice,7,
