"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at this price. Let's start with a fair offer. Would you consider purchasing the product for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is close to her value, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if we can get a better price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($75) gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below Alice's starting point.
* **Opens the Floor:** This counteroffer encourages Alice to reveal more about her willingness to negotiate. If she's firm on a price close to $95, we'll know to adjust our strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $85 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating flexibility. We haven't reached a point where further negotiation seems futile. 
* **Target Price in Sight:** Our goal is to get as close to $75 as possible.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $85 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could we settle on $80? That would be great."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving closer to Alice's offer in smaller increments ($5) to signal we're serious but still seeking a deal.
* **Justification:** Giving a reason (""stretch for my budget"") provides a relatable reason for our counteroffer and keeps the tone positive.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, so it's time to guide the price towards a point where we're ready to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $82 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:**  Alice has come down significantly from her original offer, and $82 is a reasonable price considering our target of $75.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continued back-and-forth might not yield a drastically better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we might get the price down a little more, the difference is likely to be small. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less flexible in later rounds."
