"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be open to that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this price, as I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. ",8000.0,Alice,5,
