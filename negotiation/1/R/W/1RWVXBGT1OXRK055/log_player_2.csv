"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is within your budget of $150 and is a better deal than buying from John for $150. Even though the product is worth $150 to you, accepting Alice's offer saves you $25."
