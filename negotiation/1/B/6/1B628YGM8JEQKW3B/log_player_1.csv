Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It also gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is simply too low.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $120. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum, but it's also a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to sell to John for $100."
