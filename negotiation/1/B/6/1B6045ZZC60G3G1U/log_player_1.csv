"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price through continued negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have a chance to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually lowering the price while still aiming for a decent profit. By offering $9,800, I'm showing flexibility while remaining close to my desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer."
