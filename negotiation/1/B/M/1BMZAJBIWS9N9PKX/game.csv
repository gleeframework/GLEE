"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $13,500? That's still a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,500. How about $13,000? That's the best I can do at this point.",13000.0,Bob,4,
