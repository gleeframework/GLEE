Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in.  It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1,500,000.  I think it has the potential to be even more valuable in your hands.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm setting a high initial price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, which can help him see the worth beyond just a price tag. 
* **Open-Ended:**  I'm not being aggressive or setting a hard deadline,  giving Bob space to consider the offer without feeling pressured. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer, considering his financial standing, and my own need to sell vs. waiting for another buyer. 
* If Bob's offer is too low, I can make a counteroffer, aiming to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open. 
* At any point, if I feel the negotiations are going nowhere, I can always accept John's offer for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value.**  I need to make at least $1,000,000 to consider selling. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob recognizes the product's potential value, which means there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **I'm not desperate.** John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.  I will consider factors like:

* **How urgently I need to sell:**  If I'm under pressure, I might be more willing to compromise.
* **Bob's perceived financial capacity:**  If I believe he can afford more, I'll push for a higher price.
* **My confidence in the product's value:**  If I truly believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000, I'll be more insistent."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,200,000?  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm stating my willingness to negotiate further, signaling that I'm open to a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value, hoping to influence his decision.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly:

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, fantastic! 
* **Rejection and Counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects again, I'll analyze his counteroffer, considering his potential financial capacity and my own need to sell vs. John's offer.
* **Sell to John:**  If the negotiation drags on or Bob's offers remain too low, I'll likely accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $900000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value you've emphasized.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The back-and-forth is getting lengthy, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. 
* **Potential for future gains:**  Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, there's always a chance that Bob will realize the value of the product and offer a higher price in the future. This could be a good long-term investment.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances.  I'll keep an open line of communication with Bob, hoping to leverage his future satisfaction with the product to potentially negotiate a higher price for future transactions."
