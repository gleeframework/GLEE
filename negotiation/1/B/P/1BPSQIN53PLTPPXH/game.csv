"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in.  It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1500000.  I think it has the potential to be even more valuable in your hands.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1200000?  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $900000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value you've emphasized.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,
