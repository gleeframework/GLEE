"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I think the product is worth more than $120. How about we meet at $135? It's a fair price considering the value it brings.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $135 is the best price. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,125.0,Bob,4,

I'm not willing to go any higher than $127.50. I'm starting to think it's time to walk away and buy from John for $150. Can you meet me at $127.50 or I'll have to consider other options?,127.5,Bob,10,
