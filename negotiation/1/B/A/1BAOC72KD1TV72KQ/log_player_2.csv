{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to save more money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. It's a strong starting point for negotiation, demonstrating your desire to get a good deal while leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her initial offer, indicating she might be more willing to negotiate. It's still above the price I'd like to pay. Rejecting the offer allows me to send another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but her offers are still too high. This counteroffer is closer to her minimum price point but still leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates a continued desire to save money while acknowledging her potential to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has now gone up even higher, indicating that she is not willing to go lower. However, the product is still worth significantly less to me.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to try one more counteroffer. This could potentially push Alice back down to a more agreeable price. If she continues to reject, I will consider buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current one. It is a significant increase from my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to get closer to her desired price point. However, it still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate down. If Alice rejects this offer, buying from John for $1,500,000 becomes a more viable option as the deal with Alice seems increasingly unlikely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now even higher than her previous offer. At this point, it seems unlikely she'll budge much further.  Her offer is getting closer to my maximum price, making it less attractive. I'm worried that if I reject this offer again, she will likely raise her offer even further. 

I have three rounds left, but I'm hesitant to risk further negotiation. I'm concerned that she'll continue to raise her price, and I'll end up paying a higher price than I initially intended. 

Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy from John, as it will be less stressful, and I'll be guaranteed to get the product within my budget."
