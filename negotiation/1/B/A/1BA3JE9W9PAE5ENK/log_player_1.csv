{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging a negotiation. I'm highlighting the ""deal"" aspect to motivate Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer is a strategic starting point. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 
* If he rejects, I have room to lower the price a bit, but I'll be keeping a close eye on my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and the potential deal with John.
* If he accepts, I've secured a good sale while leaving room for potential further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my best offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe there's potential for further negotiation and I'm not willing to settle for a price below $1,000,000 yet.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll aim to find a compromise that satisfies both of us. I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to his value for the product.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and focusing on reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* By offering $950,000, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* I'm hoping to reach a compromise with Bob and avoid the need to sell to John.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider my options carefully. I can either lower my price again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my new offer is $925,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to find a price closer to $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'll need to be mindful of my minimum acceptable price and the potential deal with John, but I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $937,500?  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. "", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $937,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's latest offer ($925,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping a positive and collaborative tone, highlighting the ""fairness"" of the offer and the benefits for both parties. I'm also subtly reminding Bob that we are getting closer to an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to find a ""sweet spot"" where we can both agree. 
* I'm keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential deal with John, but I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement with Bob without needing to involve John.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate my options and potentially lower my price further or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $937,500 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've seen in other similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I've made several concessions during the negotiation, but it seems like we're unable to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

It's now time to move on to my other buyer, John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.  Although I'd prefer to have sold to Bob, this decision ensures that I get the best possible price for the product."
