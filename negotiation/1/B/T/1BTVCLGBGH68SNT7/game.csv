"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a little high for my budget.  Could we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This offer takes into account the product's potential while acknowledging your initial offer.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make another move to reach a deal, but $725,000 is too low.  My final offer is $875,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
