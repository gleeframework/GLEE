"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and do $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so $145 would be a good compromise for me.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I appreciate that. Let's make this happen. How about $155? That's my final offer.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I need to be at $140 or lower to make it work. Can you meet me at $142.50?",142.5,Bob,6,
