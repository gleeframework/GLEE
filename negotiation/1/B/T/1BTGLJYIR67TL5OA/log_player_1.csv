"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential willingness to pay the full $1,000,000 value.  It's a bit of a gamble, but if Bob accepts, I'll get a good return. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher return. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied. I believe we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price in the following rounds. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,025,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hopeful that Bob will finally accept it. It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing Bob to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation and we're still not close to my desired price. While I'd like to get more, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and a safe option. It's better to secure a known profit than to risk a lower price or continue negotiating with Bob."
