Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $13,000 or $13,500 is still a better outcome than selling to John for $12,000. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of having a backup buyer."
