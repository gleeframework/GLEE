Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $95 starts the negotiation at a strong point, close to my ideal price.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for me to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob might get from the product, encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and potentially get him to offer more, or at least get closer to my asking price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $80 is a safe option, there's a chance I can do better with Bob, especially since the product is worth $100 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $90? It's a fair price, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** My counteroffer of $90 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, subtly putting pressure for him to come up on price.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  The message stays friendly and emphasizes fairness, keeping the negotiation open and respectful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with a better offer. How about $87 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $87 is only $3 away from my minimum acceptable price of $84. 
* **Limited Upside:**  It's unlikely I'll get significantly more from Bob.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and a higher counteroffer might risk him backing out completely.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation takes time, and I have the option to sell to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer is the most efficient way to get a decent profit quickly."
