``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet willing to settle. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm hoping to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too low for me. While I'm not happy about losing out on a potential higher price, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price. John is offering a safe and secure deal, and I'm going to take it."
