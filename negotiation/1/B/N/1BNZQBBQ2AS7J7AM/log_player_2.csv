"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think!

```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last round of negotiations. Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my target. I've been pushing for a lower price, and it seems like she's not willing to go any lower. I'm confident that I can save more by accepting this offer than by going to John and paying $1,200,000. I'm also considering that if I reject this offer, Alice might not come back with a new offer, leaving me with no deal."
