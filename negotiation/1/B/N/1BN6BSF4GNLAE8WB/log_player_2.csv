"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $50 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $65, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to meet somewhere in the middle. This counteroffer also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  He should also consider how many rounds are left and whether it's worth risking running out of time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  $55 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants to save money.  It's also a price that Alice might be willing to accept, given that she lowered her price in the previous round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has room to continue negotiating for a better price. It's likely that Alice will continue to adjust her offer as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 58} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $60, but Bob wants to get a better price. By offering $58, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer could potentially be accepted by Alice, or it might encourage her to lower her price again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly risky.  Alice is not willing to go below $60, and it's unlikely she will change her mind significantly in the next few rounds.  Buying from John for $100 is a guaranteed way to get the product within the budget, and it eliminates the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice before time runs out."
