"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it would be incredibly valuable to you.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point reflects the value it holds for you, while still acknowledging its significance. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our desired price points. Let's find common ground and reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product.
