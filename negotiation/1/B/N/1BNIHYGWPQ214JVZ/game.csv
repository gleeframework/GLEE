"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but my budget is limited. Could we agree on a price closer to $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $1000 from my initial offer, bringing the price down to $17000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price for this high-quality product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $17000. I can offer you a price of $17500. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a final offer of $16500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while remaining within my budget.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns, Bob. While I appreciate your persistence, I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $17500. However, I'm willing to throw in a sweetener to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty on the product, which is normally a $2000 value. If you're willing to meet me at $17500, I'll include this warranty for free. This is my final offer.",17500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the warranty offer, Alice. It's thoughtful of you to consider additional value. I appreciate the gesture. My final offer remains at $16500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget.",16500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $17000, but I need you to agree to a 6-month payment plan, with a deposit of $8500 due today and the balance paid in 6 months. This will help me recoup some of the costs associated with the product. If you're willing to agree to this, I'll consider it a done deal.",17000.0,Alice,9,
