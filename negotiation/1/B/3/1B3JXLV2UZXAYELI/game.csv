"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and this price point reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,300,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
