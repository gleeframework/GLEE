"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a competitive price of $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or simply buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't sell the product for less than $15,000. It's a very fair price considering the value it offers. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Since he can get the same product from John for $12,000, it's in his best interest to continue negotiating with Alice or simply buy from John."
