"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit too low for me right now. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $16,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make a profit. What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to pay more than $15,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a fair compromise.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and your desire for a fair price. To be honest, $15,000 is simply not a feasible number for me at this time. However, I'm willing to go a bit further and offer the product to you for $15,500. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with you, but it's the lowest I can go.  What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
