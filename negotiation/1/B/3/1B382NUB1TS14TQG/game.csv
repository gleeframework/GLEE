"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $8800 is still just a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $9150.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",9150.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8900?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back-and-forth.  We're both close to a deal, but $8900 just won't work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9025.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",9025.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8950, but no higher. Please consider this as my final offer.",8950.0,Bob,8,
