"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but $8,500 is too low. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or with John, who is willing to pay my full asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up to a more reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,800 is still just a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $9,150.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9150}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $8,900. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to go higher, but if he refuses, I'm going to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back-and-forth.  We're both close to a deal, but $8,900 just won't work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,025.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8950, but no higher. Please consider this as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950.

I've reached my limit with Bob.  While $8,950 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not acceptable to me. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's the best option I have at this point."
