"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount. $12,000 represents a good starting point, offering a substantial price reduction while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Staying within Budget:** The offer stays well below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Direct & Friendly Tone:** The message is direct and friendly, showing Bob is interested but aiming for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13000? That's still a great price considering the product's value to you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Bob has room to maneuver and could potentially secure a better deal by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer, but only by a small amount ($500). This demonstrates he's serious about a deal but still wants a good price.
* **Final Offer:** Declaring this as his ""final offer"" creates pressure on Alice. It suggests that further negotiation will be unproductive and could lead to Bob seeking another seller.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is short and to the point, focusing on the price and indicating a firm stance."
