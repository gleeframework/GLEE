"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is fair, given the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John, and Alice is still offering a price that is too high for Bob's desired value.  There's still room to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and gets us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to reduce the price by $50,000. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and there are only 5 rounds left.  If Bob keeps negotiating, he runs the risk of Alice rejecting all of his offers and being unable to buy the product at all. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his ideal price."
