"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Test the Waters:**  Bob's reaction to this offer will give me valuable information about his interest and potential budget.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a great outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly for subsequent rounds. 
* I'll keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net, ready to accept if negotiations with Bob stall."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $900,000. While it's a decent price, I believe I can still get a better deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  My product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I believe it's worth more to Bob. 
* **Testing the Limits:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm testing his willingness to pay closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'm trying to establish a negotiating range and push Bob towards a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to Round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between his offer of $900,000 and my original offer of $1,200,000.
* I'll continue to monitor my options, including John's offer of $800,000, in case negotiations with Bob become unproductive."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,000,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Signal of Flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:**  This price still leaves room for me to potentially accept a slightly lower offer in later rounds if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer of $800,000.
* I'm carefully monitoring the number of rounds remaining to ensure I don't run out of time."

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap Further:** This offer is closer to Bob's latest offer of $950,000, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground.
