"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already given you a great deal, and I think $112 is a fair price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $120, and I think he would be a good buyer. I'm giving you one last chance to meet me at $112. If not, I'll have to move on.",112.0,Alice,9,
