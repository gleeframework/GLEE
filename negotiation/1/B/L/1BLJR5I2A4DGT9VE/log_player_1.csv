Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, her guaranteed price from John. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below John's price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message implies this is a good deal, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice the opportunity to still get close to her desired price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't want to risk losing the sale entirely by pushing for a price too close to $12,000. Bob might find it insulting and walk away."
