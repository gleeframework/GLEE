"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,500. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer of $18,000.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my value for the product and your initial price, I'd like to offer $15,500. This would allow us to both gain a decent value from the transaction. What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. Considering your latest offer of $15,500, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product for $17,200. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer of $18,000.",17200.0,Alice,5,
