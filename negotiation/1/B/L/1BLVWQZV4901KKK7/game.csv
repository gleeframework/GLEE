"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. This is the best I can do at this point.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $7900. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price.
