Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to your business.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you as it's above your minimum value."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000, which would still leave you with a decent profit considering your minimum value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a solution that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9200. This is as low as I can go, considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above your budget.  It's likely the negotiation will continue to be difficult.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to get a better price from Alice and you are at risk of going over your budget. It's best to buy from John at this point and get a product at your desired price."
