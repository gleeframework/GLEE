{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $10,000. It allows for some negotiation while still leaving room for profit. I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price, but I'm also not ready to walk away completely.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some profit for me. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit, as I believe the product holds more value for him than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum value, and I believe there's a good chance he won't budge much further.  Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit, and it avoids the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer or me having to sell to John for the lower price."
