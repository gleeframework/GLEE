# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money."
