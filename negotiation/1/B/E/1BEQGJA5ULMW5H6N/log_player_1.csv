I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This demonstrates my commitment to the deal while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not close to what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which is likely to be drawn out and unproductive."
