Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. Let's settle at $12,500. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to work with you and get this product in your hands.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer.  There's room to push Alice further down and try to get closer to the $8,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $12,500 is still more than I had hoped to spend. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,500 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message combines a firm stance on the budget with a willingness to compromise slightly.  
* **Final Offer:**  By presenting this as your final offer, you add a sense of urgency and signal that you're serious about sticking to your budget.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that you have John as a backup plan."
