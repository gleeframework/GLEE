"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down significantly?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents fair value, I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Could you consider $18,000? This feels like a significant step, and I'm eager to see this product working for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. To be frank, I can purchase a comparable product elsewhere for around my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $10,000. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate. I understand there might be other options available, but I genuinely believe in the unique value this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to consider $14,000. This is a substantial price adjustment, reflecting my desire to make this deal work.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $11,000 for the right deal.  However, I do need to be realistic about what I can afford.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. Let's settle at $12,500. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to work with you and get this product in your hands.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $12,500 is still more than I had hoped to spend. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,500 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,8,
