"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 by you. I am offering it to you today at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a product that offers exceptional value and benefits tailored to your needs. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this special offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $10,000
* **John's price:** $10,000

Since you can get the product from John for the same price as Alice's offer, it's better to reject Alice's offer. This is because there is no benefit to accepting her offer and you are not losing anything by rejecting it.  You can then go to John and purchase the product for $10,000."
