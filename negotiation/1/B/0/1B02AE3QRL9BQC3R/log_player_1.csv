"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit. This offer leaves room for negotiation, but also establishes a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's not completely unreasonable.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a new offer in the next round. This keeps the negotiation going and gives me the chance to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. $750,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's likely to be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $600,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial target. I'm not ready to settle yet, and I'm going to try to get Bob to move higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can push him a little higher.  There's still time, and I don't want to settle for less than I can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  This offer is still profitable for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise, given the back-and-forth negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John.  While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I've reached a point where I'm not comfortable with the risk of further negotiation. John's offer guarantees me my desired price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
