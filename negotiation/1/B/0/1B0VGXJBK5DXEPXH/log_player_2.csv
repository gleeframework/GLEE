```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like we're at a stalemate.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John, who is offering a price that fits my budget. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
