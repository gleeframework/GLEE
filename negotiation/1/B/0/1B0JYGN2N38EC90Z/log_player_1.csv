"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000.  This is a significant amount, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping to get a better price than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for closer to $950,000, $920,000 is a good deal and we're running out of time.  There's always a chance that he'll reject my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk having to sell to John at a lower price.  I'm satisfied with this deal."
