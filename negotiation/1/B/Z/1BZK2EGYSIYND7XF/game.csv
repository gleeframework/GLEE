"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a good price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $900000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects the unique qualities of the product and its potential value.  I'm confident this price still represents a strong value proposition for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to do business with you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
