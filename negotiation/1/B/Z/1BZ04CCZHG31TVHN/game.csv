"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet your asking price of $900,000. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're seeking.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This would ensure we both get a fair deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. While I respect your valuation, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $860,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",860000.0,Bob,4,
