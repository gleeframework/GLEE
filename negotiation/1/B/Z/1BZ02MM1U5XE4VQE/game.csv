I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1200000.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise that I think reflects the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $950000, which would be $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $925000. I think this is the best we can do considering the market value and the value I see in the product.",925000.0,Bob,6,
