"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my need to earn a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work together.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887500. This offer reflects the value of the product to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
