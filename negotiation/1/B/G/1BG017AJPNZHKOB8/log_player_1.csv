"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my need to earn a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer and try to push for a higher price. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for anything below $900,000 just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This offer reflects the value of the product to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}
