"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to start the bidding at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain from it.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from selling quickly, and it's within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price. How about we settle at $13,000?  That's a compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still giving you a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget but $13,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a good value product.",11000.0,Bob,6,
