Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, Alice, but I'm really close to my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:

It's time to accept. Bob is unlikely to go higher, and while there's a chance to make a few more dollars, it's getting risky. Taking the $88 guarantees a good profit without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
