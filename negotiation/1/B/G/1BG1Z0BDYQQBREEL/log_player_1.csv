"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives Bob a potential $2,000 in savings, while still allowing me to make a profit. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit more. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $13,000.  This is still a good profit for me and hopefully attractive enough for Bob to consider.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation if necessary, but I don't want to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $11,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to offer $12,500.  This is a compromise, but it's still a good profit for me and I think Bob might be willing to accept it.  We're getting close to a deal, so I want to be flexible but not give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting too low for me.  I'm not comfortable going lower than $12,000, and I'm worried that we'll be stuck in a loop of counteroffers.  John is a sure thing at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
