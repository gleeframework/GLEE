Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $1,725,000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000.

While Bob is moving in the right direction, we're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push a bit further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,725,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but $1,775,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $1,700,000? I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

Bob is now getting close enough to our acceptable range. While we could push for more, there's always a risk he'll drop out. Accepting his offer at $1,700,000 secures a significant profit."
