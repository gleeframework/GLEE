Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can consider lowering the price slightly, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $90. This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but I also believe the product is worth more."
