"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset to your company. Given its potential, I'm asking for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.**  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $900,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is not the best option at this point.** While John's price is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob might be able to get from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.**  The price has dropped to $875,000, which is lower than Bob's maximum of $1,000,000.
* **There's a good chance this is the best deal Bob will get.**  While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down more. 
* **Buying from John is still more expensive.**  There's no reason to pay $1,000,000 when a better deal is available."
