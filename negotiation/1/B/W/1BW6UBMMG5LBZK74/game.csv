"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can meet you halfway and offer $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I was thinking that since you're willing to pay $8,000, I could meet you at that price, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive. I'll give you a 1-year warranty on the product, which is a $2,000 value. So, I'll sell the product to you for $8,000, plus I'll include the warranty, which brings the total value to $10,000 for you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
