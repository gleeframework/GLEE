"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It also gives Bob a sense that the product is valuable and worth considering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer in the next round.  $400,000 is significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm countering with $700,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still a good amount for me.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $525,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm going to counter with $650,000.  This is a compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price given the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I'm going to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 620000}
```

I'm going to counter with $620,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to start making concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $585,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $585,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're running out of rounds, and I'm not ready to settle for that price just yet. I'm hoping to get a slightly higher offer in the next round. However, if I can't get a better offer, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $600,000. This is my final offer. I'm willing to go slightly lower than my previous offer, but I won't go any lower.  We're down to the last round, so I need to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is it, the final round. Bob's offer of $580,000 is still below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to risk getting nothing at all by rejecting his offer.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed profit and a much safer option at this point."
