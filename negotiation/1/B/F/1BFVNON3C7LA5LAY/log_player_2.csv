"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$850,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as we can potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price quickly.  $600,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer and should be a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still higher than my ideal price. We're already past halfway through the negotiations. It's worth continuing to try to get a better deal from Alice, but if she doesn't come down further, we'll need to consider John's offer in the coming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $650,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a significant discount.  We're approaching the midpoint of the negotiations, so it's time to start moving closer to a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$725,000 is a reasonable price, but I believe I can still get a better deal with Alice. I'm only halfway through the negotiations, and we're already closer to my target price than her initial offer. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $700,000.  This is a small increment, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to get serious about finding a deal. I'm aiming for a price that is fair for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $715,000, which is closer to my target price than her previous offers. With only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is increasing.  While I would prefer to negotiate further, accepting her offer now ensures I get the product at a good price, avoiding the potential of having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
