Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum price of $80.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering Bob values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price of $95, $90 is still a good deal and I'm confident I can make a profit.  I'd rather sell to Bob and avoid the risk of further negotiations or having to sell to John for a lower price."
