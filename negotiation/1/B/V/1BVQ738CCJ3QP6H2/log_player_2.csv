"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us â€“ it's well below what it's worth to me, and gives you a substantial profit margin. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget of $800,000. He can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
