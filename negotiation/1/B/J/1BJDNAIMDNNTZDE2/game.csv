"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering I could purchase a similar product from John for $1,000,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what you could get from John. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit outside my comfortable range. I'm prepared to offer $1,125,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and provides a fair margin for you. I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this point.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
