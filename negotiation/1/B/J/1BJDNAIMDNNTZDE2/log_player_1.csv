Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering I could purchase a similar product from John for $1,000,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
