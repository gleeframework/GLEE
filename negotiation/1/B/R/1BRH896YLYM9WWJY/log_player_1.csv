I'm dropping my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a compromise with Bob. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I would have preferred to get more, this guarantees me a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
