Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $18,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is his maximum valuation. It's unlikely he'll go higher.
