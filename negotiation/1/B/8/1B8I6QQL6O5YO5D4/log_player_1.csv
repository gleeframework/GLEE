I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. It's worth more to me than that, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $8,500 for this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

``` 
Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $9,500, this is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale."
