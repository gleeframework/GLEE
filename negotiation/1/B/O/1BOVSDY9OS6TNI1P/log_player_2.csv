"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm offering for $13,500.  Considering its worth to you, I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.**  Buying from Alice saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* **While Alice's offer is a bit more than the product is worth to her, it still allows her to make a profit.**  This makes the offer reasonable and likely to be accepted."
