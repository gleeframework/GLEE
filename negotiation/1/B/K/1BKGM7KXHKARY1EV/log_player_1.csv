I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to both of us. I'm aiming for a profit, but I also want to be open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell it for less than my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profit for me. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum threshold and provides me with a decent profit. While I could keep negotiating, there's always the risk of him backing out or me losing time. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
