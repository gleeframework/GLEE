Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $100? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than $80, I think I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still too low for me. How about $110?  I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
