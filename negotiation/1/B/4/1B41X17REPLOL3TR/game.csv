,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $160 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $165? That's still a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $165. Can you consider $162.50?,162.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $162.50 is still a bit low for me.  How about we compromise at $164? It's just a small step closer to what I need, and it's still a great deal for you.",164.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $163, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",163.0,Bob,6,
