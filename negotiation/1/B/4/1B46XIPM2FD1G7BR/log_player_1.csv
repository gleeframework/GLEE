{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to start the negotiation and see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I want to try and get closer to my desired price point. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand that $8,500 is your current offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a little hesitant to go that low.  Let's compromise at $9,250. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no more. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still too low for me.  While I'd prefer to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. John is guaranteed to buy the product for $10,000, so that's the best option for me at this point."
