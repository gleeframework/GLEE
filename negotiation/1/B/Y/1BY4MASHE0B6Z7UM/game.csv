"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first.  I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This product is really worth it, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $112?",112.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you seem really keen on this product and I want to be fair. How about we split the difference again and settle on $118?  It's a great deal!",118.0,Alice,5,
