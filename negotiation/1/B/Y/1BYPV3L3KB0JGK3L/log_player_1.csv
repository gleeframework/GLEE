**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and doesn't seem willing to budge.  We've tried to meet in the middle, and even given a ""final offer"", but he's sticking to his original price.  At this point, it's unlikely we'll get more than $100 from him. Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $100, it's time to cut our losses and sell to him."
