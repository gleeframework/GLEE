"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2200000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $2200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1800000 was too high for you, so I'll try to meet you in the middle from your last offer. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1500000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low.

"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, Alice, but $1900000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll offer $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
