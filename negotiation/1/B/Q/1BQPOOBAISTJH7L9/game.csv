"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only offer $12000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm still interested in the product, $16000 is still above my budget. Let's meet at $14000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows us to make a mutually beneficial deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,5,
