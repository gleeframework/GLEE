"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the [Product Name], but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That would still give me a good amount for the product, and it's a better price than what John is offering.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on that.",100.0,Bob,4,
