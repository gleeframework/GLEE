"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but  $2,000,000 is not feasible. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering.  I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and what it can bring to your business.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price. However, we're still pretty far apart on our valuations of this product. To be frank, anything above $1,200,000 simply doesn't make sense for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000 to show I'm serious about finding a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. Your most recent offer doesn't reflect the progress we need to make. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
