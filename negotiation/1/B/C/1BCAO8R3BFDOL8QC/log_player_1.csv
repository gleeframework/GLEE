Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but  $2,000,000 is not feasible. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price. However, we're still pretty far apart on our valuations of this product. To be frank, anything above $1,200,000 simply doesn't make sense for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000 to show I'm serious about finding a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. Your most recent offer doesn't reflect the progress we need to make. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this doesn't work, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,100,000 offer.  It's clear he values the product considerably less than you do. Accepting a lower offer from Bob would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to selling to John.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
