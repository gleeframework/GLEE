Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below my minimum.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum with Bob, the negotiation is becoming slow. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid further rounds of potential rejection."
