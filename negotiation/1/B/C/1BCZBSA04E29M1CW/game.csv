"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This would still give you a significant profit margin and allow me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a good opportunity for you, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
