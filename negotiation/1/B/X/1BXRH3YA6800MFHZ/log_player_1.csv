"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiation at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This might make Bob more receptive to a lower (but still profitable) price later. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The high starting price gives me ample room to negotiate down throughout the 10 rounds. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will give me insight into Bob's eagerness and potential negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a good profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Bob Showed His Hand:**  His counteroffer reveals he values the product and is willing to pay a significant amount.
* **Time is On My Side:** It's only round 2.  I have time to work towards a better price.
* **John is the Safety Net:** I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer closer to Bob's price but still significantly above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still quite a ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by coming down $150,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and might encourage him to make a similar move.
* **Staying Above the Target:**  $1,650,000 is still a substantial profit margin and closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly pushing back against Bob's lower valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal and would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,600,000 is a $400,000 profit margin, a significant return. 
* **Positive Negotiation Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to make a deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of a stalemate or Bob lowering his offer in later rounds. 

While I could potentially push for a bit more, the current offer represents a good balance of profit and minimized risk."
