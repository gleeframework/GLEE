Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob below your minimum. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit from Bob with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
