"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He has a range to work with, as he is willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's minimum is likely closer to $10,000.  Negotiating could potentially get a price lower than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $12,000.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for potential compromise. It's also below Bob's maximum price point of $15,000, leaving him some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement on her previous offer of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at $15,000 is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without unnecessary risk."
