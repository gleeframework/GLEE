,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I think $105 is a more reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $97.50.  Let's make this deal happen!",97.5,Bob,6,
