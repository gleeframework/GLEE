"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you loud and clear.  $1,230,000 is a strong offer, but I'm just $2,500 away from where I need to be. Let's make this work –  I'm offering the product for $1,232,500.  It's a small difference, and we can close this deal.",1232500.0,Alice,7,
