"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its potential value. However, $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $1400000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1600000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. To finalize the deal, I'm offering $1500000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,,
