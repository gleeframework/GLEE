"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this incredible product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $800,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come up in price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product.  Would you be willing to consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is closer to his target, he can still try to push for a lower price. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already made a counteroffer that was rejected, and Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  At $850,000, he's getting a good deal.  If he rejects, there's a good chance he'll have to buy from John for $1,500,000.  It's better to accept the offer and save $650,000."
