"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product.  Would you be willing to consider this offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
