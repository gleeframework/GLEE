"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $120, which is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying, this is our final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I really like the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $118. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider it?",118.0,Bob,6,
