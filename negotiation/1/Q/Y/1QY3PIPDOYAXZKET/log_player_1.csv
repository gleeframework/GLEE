{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will find the offer appealing enough to accept. However, if he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and make sure I get the best possible price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $8,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher price, it's a good deal for me, especially since I can always sell it to John for the same amount.  Let's close this deal!"
