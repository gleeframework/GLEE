Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, guaranteeing her at least $1,200,000. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

By starting at $1,400,000, Alice creates a strong starting point that benefits both parties if accepted, while still leaving room to negotiate down to a minimum of $1,200,000 if needed."
