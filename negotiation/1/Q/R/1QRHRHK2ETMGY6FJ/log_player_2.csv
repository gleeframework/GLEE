# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing your expertise in this area would allow you to maximize its potential.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  What do you think about $900,000?  This is a substantial discount from its true value to me, and I'm confident it would be a smart investment for your business.
