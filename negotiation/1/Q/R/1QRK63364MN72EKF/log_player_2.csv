Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than that.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's close this deal at $800,000, and we can both move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $800000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still above your budget. You've already made your maximum offer and been rejected twice. It's becoming clear that Alice isn't willing to meet your price. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for your maximum budget of $800,000. This ensures you get the product without risking further negotiation and potential price increases."
