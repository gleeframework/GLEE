"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It has significant potential and I'm confident it could be a valuable asset for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the potential of the product, I'm willing to offer $600000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this opportunity.  Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $600000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000,  a price that reflects the value I see in this product and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside my comfortable range.  Given my budget constraints, I'm offering $750000 as my final offer.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's finalize this agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
