{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. Bob wants to save as much as possible and knows he has the option to buy from John for a lower price.  He will continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but still staying below Alice's last offer. He's hoping to find a middle ground and avoid having to buy from John. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about making a deal, but he's also committed to getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now exactly Bob's budget limit.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better price, and he risks running out of rounds.  He also risks having Alice reject his counteroffer and leaving him with no deal. It's a good deal for Bob, so he should accept it."
