"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not comfortable going below $12,500.  This reflects the product's value and the fact that I have other potential buyers. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $12,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",12250.0,Bob,4,
