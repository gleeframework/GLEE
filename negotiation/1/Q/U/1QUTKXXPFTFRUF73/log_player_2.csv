"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $145 is a better price than John's $150, you can still do better.  You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate further. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially push for a lower price from Alice or at least explore other options."
