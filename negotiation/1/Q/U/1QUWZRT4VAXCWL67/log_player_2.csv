"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, a price of $1,200,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. You can aim for an even lower price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.

While $1,150,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target of $1,000,000."

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but you can still push for a better deal.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, a price of $1,225,000 is still within your budget, but you can try to negotiate further and see if you can get a lower price."
