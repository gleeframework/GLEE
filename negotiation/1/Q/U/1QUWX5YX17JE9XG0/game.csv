"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but I have my budget limits. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to where it needs to be, I'm still a bit far off. How about we settle at $800,000? This seems like a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is tempting, I need to consider my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
