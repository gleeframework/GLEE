"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Value for Bob:** This price is still significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product ($10,000), making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Safety net:** I can always go to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects the offer. This gives me a fallback option and bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher profit:** While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I can potentially get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **Counter-offering:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay closer to my minimum value. I can use this information to negotiate further. 
* **Strategic position:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a decent profit.
* **Strategic concession:**  Reducing my price demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of my minimum value.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement, knowing I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Time constraint:** We're already halfway through the rounds, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal.
* **Avoiding risk:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob will walk away or we'll reach a stalemate. Accepting this offer ensures a relatively good profit and minimizes risk."
