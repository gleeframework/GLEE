Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring we don't miss out on a sale entirely."
