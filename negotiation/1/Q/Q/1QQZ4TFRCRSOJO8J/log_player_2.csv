**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. She's likely very close to her absolute bottom line, and pushing further risks her walking away from the deal. 

* **We're close to the end:**  With only one round left after this, you have little room to negotiate further.
* **Significant savings:** You've already brought the price down significantly from the initial $950,000. Accepting at $805,000 is a saving of $145,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from another round of negotiation is likely small compared to the risk of Alice walking away or hardening her stance, forcing you to buy from John at the much higher price."
