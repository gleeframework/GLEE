Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the price I was thinking of initially. Can you meet me at this price?

Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,650,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to $1,600,000, it's getting late in the negotiation, and $1,580,000 is a good price. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price."
