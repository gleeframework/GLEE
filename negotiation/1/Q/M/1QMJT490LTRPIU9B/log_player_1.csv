Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the fact that other buyers are interested, creating a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
