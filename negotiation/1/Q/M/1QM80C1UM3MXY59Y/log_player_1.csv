Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more than he initially thought the product was worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffers are getting too low for my comfort. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum requirement."
