"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to land somewhere in the middle between his $15,000 limit and Alice's $8,000 value. This shows his commitment to getting a good deal while also demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above the value of the product to her ($8,000).  Even though it's closer to Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to continue the negotiation to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer from $9,000 to $10,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.  It's likely Alice will accept this offer, as it's significantly higher than her value and likely closer to her desired selling point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, she's still above what he's willing to pay.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his counteroffer to $11,000. This is getting closer to Alice's likely desired selling point, making it more likely she'll accept.  However, it's still below his maximum price, so he's not giving up too much yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John at $15,000 and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a price he's not comfortable with."
