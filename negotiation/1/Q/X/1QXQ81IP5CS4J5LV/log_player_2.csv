"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for no more than $80. Alice's offer of $170 is significantly higher than Bob's limit.  It's best to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to start by making a bold counteroffer, proposing the absolute maximum he's willing to pay. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal. While there's a chance Alice will reject this offer immediately, it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's closer to Bob's goal, it's still outside of his acceptable range.  Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing some flexibility. However, he's still well below Alice's last offer. This strategy aims to signal to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't pay an unreasonable price. The goal is to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, but it's still $30 more than he wants to pay.  Bob has already made a counteroffer close to his target price, and it makes sense to continue negotiating, especially since he has more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still keeping it below Alice's offer and within his own budget. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next round."
