"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer. I'm aiming for a price closer to the value I place on the product, but I need to see how willing Bob is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept it and get some money, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate. I still need to make a profit, but I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway.  130 is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges his offer but keeps me above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I am willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to close the deal at a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but still above my minimum value.  I'm trying to find a price point where Bob is willing to buy and I can still make a decent profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, the negotiations seem to be dragging on and Bob's offers aren't getting close enough to my desired price.  Rather than risk losing even more time, I'm going to accept the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product for $150.  It's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who appears unwilling to meet me halfway."
