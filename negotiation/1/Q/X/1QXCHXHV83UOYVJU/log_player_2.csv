"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.**
* **You have room to negotiate.**  A counteroffer will give you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. This is a great compromise that I think you'll find very attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget of $100.**
* **You're saving $2.50 compared to your initial counteroffer.**
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it risks the deal falling through or Alice becoming less willing to negotiate.**"
