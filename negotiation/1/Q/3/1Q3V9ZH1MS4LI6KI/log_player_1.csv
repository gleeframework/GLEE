Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, but lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, you make $2,000 more than his valuation.
* **Minimize risk:** If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price.

It's a balanced approach that tries to get the best possible price while ensuring a sale."
