Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $10000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than $10,000.  Even if I don't, I have the option of selling to John, so I'm not risking anything."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm confident this product is worth it to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. How about $11000?  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk getting nothing."
