"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity.  I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount. This aggressive approach puts pressure on Alice and demonstrates Bob's willingness to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm confident this product is worth it to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a better deal.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000?  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  The offer of $11,000 is a good compromise point, balancing the value of the product with Bob's desire for a good deal."
