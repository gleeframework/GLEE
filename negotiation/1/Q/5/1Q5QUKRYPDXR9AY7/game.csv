"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
