{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get more.  I will counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $115. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and am willing to pay up to $110 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is only $5 less than my desired price of $115, and much higher than John's offer of $100.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the sale."
