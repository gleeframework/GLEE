"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is already quite close to your maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer a bit below your target price. This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly indicates that the initial offer is too high.
* **Realistic Target:** $105 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer but still provides a decent profit margin for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $110 is a fair compromise. You're saving $10 compared to John's offer and Alice is still making a profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly better price, but there's also the risk Alice might increase her offer or you might reach an impasse. It's not worth the risk of losing out on a $10 saving."
