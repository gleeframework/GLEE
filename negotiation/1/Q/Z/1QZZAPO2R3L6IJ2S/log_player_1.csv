Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'm prepared to offer you $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.
