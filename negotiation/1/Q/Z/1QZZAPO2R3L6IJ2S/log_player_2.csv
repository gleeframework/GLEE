Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game changer and I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit your operations.  I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the immense value it brings. Let's discuss further.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly exceptional and I'm confident it will deliver immense value for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's worth, while also allowing for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find common ground and make this happen.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product has value, but I need to stay within my budget.
