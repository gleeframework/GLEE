Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she rejects this offer, I'll adjust my next counteroffer based on her response."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below Alice's latest price.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I only have five rounds left.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product at a good price."
