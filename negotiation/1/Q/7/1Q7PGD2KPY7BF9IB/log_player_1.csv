{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's well above your minimum:** You're still ensuring a substantial profit for yourself.
* **It opens the door for negotiation:** This message invites Bob to engage in a conversation about price, which is key to getting the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth negotiating further. You can likely get closer to your desired price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. It's possible that Bob is willing to go slightly higher, especially since the product holds significant value for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $850,000 is a great starting point, it's slightly below what I need to make this deal work. Would you be willing to consider $900,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a positive tone:** By acknowledging Bob's offer and showing appreciation, you create a more collaborative negotiation environment.
* **Present a compromise:**  $900,000 represents a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Highlight the value proposition:** Remind Bob of the significant value he would be gaining with this product.
* **Invite further negotiation:** The final sentence suggests a willingness to continue the conversation and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is just $25,000 below your minimum.  At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. Accepting his offer secures a sale that's very close to your desired price point."
