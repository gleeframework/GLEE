Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Its value to both of us is undeniable. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth at $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Scarcity tactic:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quicker.
* **Guaranteed fallback:**  You have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, so there's no risk of losing money.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on maximizing profit. A different approach might involve a more collaborative negotiation style."
