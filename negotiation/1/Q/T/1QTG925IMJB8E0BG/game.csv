,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $600000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $750000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $700000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $700000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $775000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $775000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $725000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $725000 is a good offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it for a moment. Let me see... I'm thinking of a price of $800000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
