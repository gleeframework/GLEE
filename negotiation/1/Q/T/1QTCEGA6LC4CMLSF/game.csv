"I understand you think the product is pricey, but I believe it's worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1050000. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer a price of $1025000.

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.
