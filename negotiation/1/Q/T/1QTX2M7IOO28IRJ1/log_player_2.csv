You have three options:

You can do better than $100.  It's worth rejecting and counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100 for this. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

While $95 is closer to your goal, you can still get a better price.  Reject and counteroffer again."
