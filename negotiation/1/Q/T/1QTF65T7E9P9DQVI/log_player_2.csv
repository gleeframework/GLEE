Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer you a deal at $85, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. What do you think?

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
