"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $14,500 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product just as much at this price.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,500? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
