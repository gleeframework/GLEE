Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong initial offer:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product. 

By offering a slightly higher price than your minimum, you leave room for negotiation and increase the chances of a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $9,500. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a bit more.  You know Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away if you don't get a better price. This can put pressure on Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but not cave completely.
* **Justify your price:** The message explains the reasoning behind the price, appealing to Bob's perceived value.
* **Maintain leverage:** You're not giving in completely, keeping the pressure on Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $9,100 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has indicated this is his final offer. While you could counteroffer again, it's likely that further negotiations will only drag things out, and you might end up with the same price or even less.  

Given that Bob's offer is close to your desired price and you have the option to sell to John for $8,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It ensures a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
