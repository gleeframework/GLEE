"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in making an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer aims to establish a starting point significantly below Alice's initial offer but still potentially profitable for her. By being direct and providing a specific price, we hope to move the negotiation forward efficiently."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can do a bit better than $110, but I need to make a profit. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to come down, so we can try countering a bit higher than our previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

This counter-offer aims to be a fair compromise, recognizing Alice's need to make a profit while getting us closer to our target price. It's possible Alice will accept this offer as it represents her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to meeting you at $120, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more. How about we meet at $127.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to squeeze out a bit more profit.  We're getting close to our limit, but it's worth one more try to see if we can get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're close to a deal, Alice. Would you be willing to settle at $123? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 123
}
```

This offer represents a small concession on our part while still achieving a price below Alice's initial offer and within a reasonable range of our target. By framing it as a win-win, we hope to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $123, Bob, but I'd like to make a bit more. How about we meet right at the middle at $124? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $124
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly very intent on getting a price above $123, and we're running out of rounds. This offer is a reasonable compromise â€“ we save $26 compared to John's offer, and it's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
