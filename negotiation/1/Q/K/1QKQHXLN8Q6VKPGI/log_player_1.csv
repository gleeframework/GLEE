"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 

I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial offer. If Bob rejects, we can see how much he values the product and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I have 9 rounds left and can likely get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can improve on this offer by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with $14,500. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. It's a middle ground that could be appealing to him. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds, so I'm not going for a huge jump but still pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have several rounds left and am not willing to settle just yet.  There's a possibility that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm not in a rush and can afford to be a little patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with $14,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still within a range that's likely acceptable to him, as it's closer to his previous offer than my previous counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my ideal.  We're down to 5 rounds, so I need to start closing in on a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is tempting, it's still below my preferred range.  I have 4 rounds left and can likely secure a higher price. By rejecting and counter-offering, I show Bob that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's last offer.  I'm also mindful that we're down to just 3 rounds remaining. I need to find a price point that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  With only two rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or no deal at all outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly higher price. I'm confident that accepting this offer is the best decision, as it ensures I get a good price for the product within the allotted rounds."
