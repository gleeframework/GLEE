Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, I was hoping to find the product within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, would you be open to selling the product for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $87 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by pushing too hard."
