"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very patient, and I appreciate that.  I can do $80, and I think that's a very fair offer considering it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,6,
