"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 falls quite short of the value this product brings.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize the value, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $980,000. Can we meet at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints. Let's make this final offer: $1,000,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $980,000, which is the maximum I can afford. If you're willing to accept this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",980000.0,Bob,8,
