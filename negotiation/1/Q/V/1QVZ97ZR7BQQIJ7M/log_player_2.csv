"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our latest innovation, a product that I believe will significantly enhance your operations and increase your efficiency. Given its unique features and potential impact on your business, I estimate its value to be $10,000 to me. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I propose a fair transaction where you pay $9,000 for this game-changing product. This price reflects the balance between its intrinsic value and your perceived benefit, aiming to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's discuss how we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price, achieving his goal of saving money."
