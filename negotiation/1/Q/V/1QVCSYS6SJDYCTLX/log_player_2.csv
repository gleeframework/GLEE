{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* You want to save as much money as possible."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is likely to want to make a profit, so offering $60 is a reasonable starting point.
* This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might entice her to accept. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, you can still continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

* You've established that Alice is willing to negotiate, and $70 is a good middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.

* You still have 6 more rounds to negotiate if necessary."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you still have the opportunity to get it lower.
* You're only 5 rounds away from having to buy from John, so there's still time to negotiate a better deal.
* You can try to meet in the middle and offer $80, but it's still possible to get it for less than $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're now getting close to the end of the negotiation. 
* Offering $80 shows you're willing to compromise, but still trying to get the best possible price.
* This is a fair middle ground between your last offer of $70 and Alice's offer of $90.
* If Alice rejects this, you can still go to John, but you've proven your willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, but it's still higher than your target price of $100.
* You only have 3 rounds left, and the likelihood of getting a better deal from Alice is decreasing. 
* It's more advantageous to buy from John at this point, as you are guaranteed to get the product for your target price.
* While you might get the product for slightly less from Alice in the remaining rounds, the risk of not getting a deal at all is too high."
