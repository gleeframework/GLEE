"Bob, I appreciate your offer. It demonstrates your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,500,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Could you consider $1,650,000? I believe that price reflects a fair balance between the value this product brings and your current proposal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your perspective, but given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make one final offer of $1,400,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
