Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially pricing it at $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher gives me room to negotiate and understand his true willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if we negotiate down, he's more likely to perceive a price closer to $1,200,000 as a better deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly welcomes Bob to share his thoughts, making it clear that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a strong backup plan with John, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above my Minimum, but Room for More:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000). However, it's still substantially below my initial ask, and I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product. This might encourage him to make a more competitive offer in the next round.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives me the confidence to negotiate firmly with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. It demonstrates your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,500,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Could you consider $1,650,000? I believe that price reflects a fair balance between the value this product brings and your current proposal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by a significant amount ($150,000), showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, the new price is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and my minimum, keeping me in a strong bargaining position.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""a fair balance"" and acknowledging Bob's proposal, I'm framing the counteroffer as a reasonable compromise rather than a hardline stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your perspective, but given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make one final offer of $1,400,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  While $1,400,000 is below my initial target, it's still a significant profit of $200,000 over my minimum acceptable price.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer.  Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I receive the funds sooner, allowing me to potentially reinvest or utilize them elsewhere. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
