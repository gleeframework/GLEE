{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $16,500 is still over my budget.  I'll continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price. With several rounds remaining, I don't want to rush into buying from John yet."
