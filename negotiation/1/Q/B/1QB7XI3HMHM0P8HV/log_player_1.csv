While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are not moving close enough to your minimum price quickly enough. The difference between his current offer ($1,220,000) and your minimum ($1,500,000) is substantial. It's likely continuing the negotiation will yield minimal further increases from Bob. You have a guaranteed sale with John at your desired price."
