Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go above his perceived value of $120.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
