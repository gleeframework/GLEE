"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm eager to sell to you, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500?  That would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",9500.0,Alice,3,
