"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal for her, but it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $60 as a counteroffer. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $75, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product is worth $150 to Alice and only $100 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my target, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $70 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $60 and Alice's latest offer of $85.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, as I'm only 5 rounds into the 10-round limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $75 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $70 and Alice's latest offer of $90.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a fair price.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident I can secure the product for under $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $95 is getting very close to my maximum budget, but I'm running out of time. It's only Round 7, and I've already rejected several offers from Alice.  It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price within the remaining rounds.  To avoid risking losing the product altogether, I'm going to buy it from John for $100.  This ensures I get the product within my budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
