"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $15,000, which is too expensive. I will look for a better deal.
