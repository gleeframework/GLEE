"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe $950,000 would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $950,000 is a bit below your target. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, while also being competitive with your desired price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that $975,000 is a fair price that we can both agree on.  It's closer to your last offer and still allows you to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
