"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it will be immensely valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point, giving you more room to negotiate down while still aiming for a final price significantly above your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob:** This first offer allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will give us valuable information about his willingness to pay a premium for the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer ($1,000,000). This gives us leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't attractive enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below our initial ask. We have room to negotiate and should try to meet somewhere in the middle. We're early in the process and haven't exhausted our negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It's clear you recognize the value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,400,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Value:** We're holding firm above the $1,400,000 mark, signaling that we believe the product is worth a premium.
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds left, allowing us to continue strategically negotiating towards a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** Bob is moving in the right direction, but his increments are relatively small ($50,000). This suggests he has more room to move.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob and signals that we're serious about securing a higher price. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While we risk pushing Bob too far, we're still comfortably above John's offer, giving us a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've made it clear you're serious about this product. Let's find a resolution quickly. I'm willing to come down to $1,480,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1480000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($20,000) to signal we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Introducing Scarcity:**  By framing this as our ""final offer,"" we're introducing a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might prompt Bob to act more decisively.
* **Calculated Risk:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum, but we're aware that pushing Bob too further could lead him to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,470,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,470,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,470,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** While not ideal, $1,470,000 is a substantial profit and very close to our previous offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller gains, with the risk of Bob walking away altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now puts the money in our pocket sooner, which has its own inherent value.  

It's been a tough negotiation, but sometimes a good deal is better than holding out for a perfect one that might never materialize."
