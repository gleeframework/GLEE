{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to counteroffer at $12000 for your product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $13,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
