"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this high-end product, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000, which is a significant discount. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you.  You know your maximum price is $15,000, and her starting point is suspiciously close.
* While $12,000 is less than your maximum, there's a good chance you could get a better price by negotiating with Alice further or considering John's offer as leverage."
