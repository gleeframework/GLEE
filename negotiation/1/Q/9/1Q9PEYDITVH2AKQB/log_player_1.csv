Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower ($8,000), we want to start with an offer that's significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, we subtly pressure Bob to make a decision. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""worth a significant amount"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher, even without explicitly stating a number.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Ideal scenario, we get a price significantly higher than both our minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Bob negotiates:**  We have room to come down on the price and still make a profit. We can gauge his interest and adjust accordingly.
* **Bob rejects:** We move on to John, securing our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  We could have started with a lower price to appear more agreeable, but that might leave money on the table."
