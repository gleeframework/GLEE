"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $80, but I want to see if I can get close to my desired profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is a compromise, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation.  Given that John is willing to pay $80, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John and save myself the hassle of further negotiations."
