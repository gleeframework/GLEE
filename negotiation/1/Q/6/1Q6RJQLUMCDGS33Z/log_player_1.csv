{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more in the range of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I believe I can get a better deal by countering."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,200,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still get a better deal by countering. I want to see if I can push him a little further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1,150,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,160,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the time spent and the risk of further deadlock aren't worth it. John is guaranteed to buy the product for my desired price. Selling to John is the most efficient and profitable choice at this point."
