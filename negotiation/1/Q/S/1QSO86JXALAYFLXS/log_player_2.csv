# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price.

Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price than it is to her minimum. There's room for negotiation here. I'll try a counteroffer significantly lower than hers to see how much she's willing to budge."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice has met me at her minimum price. There's no further room for negotiation, and this is a good deal compared to John's offer."
