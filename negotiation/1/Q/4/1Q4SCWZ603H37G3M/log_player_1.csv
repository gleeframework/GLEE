Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information at hand:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. She wants to get as close to that as possible without scaring Bob away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This response assumes we don't know anything about Bob's negotiating style. If Alice knew Bob was prone to hard bargaining, she might start with a higher initial offer.
* **Risk Tolerance:** Alice is taking a slight risk. If Bob rejects the offer, she'll have to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer.  However, the potential for a $150,000 profit over John's offer makes this risk worthwhile for Alice."
