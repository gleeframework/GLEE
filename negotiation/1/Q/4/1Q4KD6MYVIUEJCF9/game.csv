"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider something closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  I'd be willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the quality and potential it holds for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  Could you consider something closer to $11,000? That's the absolute highest I could go.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, how about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
