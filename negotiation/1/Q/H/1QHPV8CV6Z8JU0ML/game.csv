"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant opportunity for your company, and I believe this price reflects its worth while leaving room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000? That feels like a fairer price point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also providing a good return for you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
