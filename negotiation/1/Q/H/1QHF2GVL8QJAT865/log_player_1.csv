Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows flexibility:** Your message indicates you're open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, I believe there is still potential to earn more. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're hoping for $80, that's just below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to see $90 for it to work for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum, and there's a chance I might not be able to get a better price in the next round. It's better to secure a sale at $85 than risk getting nothing from Bob and having to sell to John for $80."
