"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to acquire a product worth $1000000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential Savings:** There's room for negotiation.  Alice is willing to sell for $950,000, which is above her desired $800,000.  This means Bob can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a Backup:**  Having John as a backup option at $1,000,000 gives Bob leverage.  He can use this to push Alice lower in the negotiation.

By rejecting, Bob can start a counteroffer process, aiming to get a price closer to his desired value or at least lower than Alice's initial offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer again.  Here's why:

* **Further Negotiation:** Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to push her lower.
* **John is Still a Backup:** John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice without the pressure of immediately needing to accept.

By rejecting, Bob can make another counteroffer, potentially getting a price closer to his target of $850,000."
