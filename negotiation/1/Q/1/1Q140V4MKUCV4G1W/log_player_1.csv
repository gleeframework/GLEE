I'm starting with a high price, $1,800,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still making a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest level and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I'm confident I won't get a significantly better offer from him. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit, and it's better than risking a prolonged negotiation that might end up with a lower price or a sale to John."
