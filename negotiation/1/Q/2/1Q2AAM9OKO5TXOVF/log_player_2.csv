"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This price allows for some flexibility while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,025,000 is still below my acceptable range.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,060,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,060,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While there is a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price in the following rounds, there's also a risk that Alice might increase her price again. Given that Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it makes more sense for him to buy from John and secure the product at his budget limit."
