"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This price allows for some flexibility while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,025,000 is still below my acceptable range.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,060,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
