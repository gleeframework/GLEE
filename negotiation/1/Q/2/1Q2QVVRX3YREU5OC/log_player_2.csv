"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has a lot of potential and I'm open to negotiating a fair price. After considering your valuation of $800,000, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This price takes into account your valuation and my own needs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! That said, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $725,000?  It's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This price is closer to my original offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's very unlikely Alice will go lower. She has met your exact maximum price, and continuing the negotiation might lead to her increasing the price or you missing out on the deal entirely."
