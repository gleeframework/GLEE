"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has a lot of potential and I'm open to negotiating a fair price. After considering your valuation of $800,000, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand the product's value, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000. This price reflects my budget and the potential I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This price takes into account your valuation and my own needs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer! That said, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $725,000?  It's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This price is closer to my original offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
