"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering it's a significant sum and I'm ready to close the deal quickly.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $650,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $725,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still being slightly below your original offer. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
