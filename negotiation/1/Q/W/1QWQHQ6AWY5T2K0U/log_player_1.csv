Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves a good margin for Bob (he gets $100,000 of value over his minimum price) and leaves me with a significant profit while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  It's a good starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'll offer you $1,200,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,300,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a substantial gain.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's final offer is still below my initial target, it's getting closer to my minimum price and it's a significant profit.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
