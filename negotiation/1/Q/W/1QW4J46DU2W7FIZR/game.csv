"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
