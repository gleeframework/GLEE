Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $15,000. This gives us leverage to start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high demand and value without explicitly revealing John's offer.  This creates a sense of scarcity and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price provides room for potential counter-offers from Bob, allowing us to gauge his interest level and potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation style, Alice (you) might need to adjust your approach in subsequent interactions."
