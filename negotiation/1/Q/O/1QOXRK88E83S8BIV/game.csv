"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, however,  $2,300,000 is closer to the product's actual value.  To move us forward, would you consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can go up to $700,000.  If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working to find common ground.  While I'm motivated to sell, I do need to ensure the price reflects the true value of the product.  How about we land in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap.  My absolute highest is $750,000.  Let me know if that's workable, otherwise I'll need to consider purchasing elsewhere.",750000.0,Bob,6,
