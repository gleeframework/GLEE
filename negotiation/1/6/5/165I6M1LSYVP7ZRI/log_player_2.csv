"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great deal for you on this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a great deal on something you really want. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is a decent price, you know you can potentially get it for less. John's price of $150 is your absolute maximum, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
