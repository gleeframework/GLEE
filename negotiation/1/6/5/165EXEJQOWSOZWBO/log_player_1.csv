Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer and I think I can still get a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in round 4. It's risky to keep negotiating, as I could end up with a lower offer or have to sell to John for a lower price."
