"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. This is a competitive price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1600000. This price is still a good deal considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1520000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
