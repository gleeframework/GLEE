"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its field, and I know you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $1200000 for it, which reflects its true potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to drop my price to $1050000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1000000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows us both to close this deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
