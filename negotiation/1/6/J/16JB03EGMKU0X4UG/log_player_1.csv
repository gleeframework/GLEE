Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price if I keep negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $100? That's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
