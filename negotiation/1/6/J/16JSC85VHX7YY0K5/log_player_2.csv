Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a lower price, Bob. However, $60 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $120.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go down to $80. She rejected it once and is now trying to inch the price back up. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk Alice not budging further."
