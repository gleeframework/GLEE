Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $11,000 is a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have room to lower the price slightly without dropping below your minimum."
