Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) creates a sense of urgency and makes it seem like Bob is getting a good deal.
* **Open Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. While you have a backup plan, you're still aiming for the highest possible profit."
