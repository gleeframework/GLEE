"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is your maximum, but I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really serious about $12,000. It's the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12000 is your absolute maximum, but I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer it to you for $13500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price.  While it's tempting to go with Alice's final offer, Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer. There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still stuck at $12,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his maximum.  Bob has only 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's not clear that Alice will agree to Bob's price. There's a good chance that Alice will reject Bob's offer and the deal will fall apart.  Given the limited time remaining, it's safer for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
