Round 2

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's value while still providing you with a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's very interested. We're still above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal than $1,500,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we could reach a point of discussion, Alice. I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. My counteroffer would be $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially push for a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than John's $1,500,000. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
