"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer.  By rejecting, I can gauge if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiation and creates room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good compromise. It's better than the $120 John is selling it for, so accepting is the best choice at this point."
