Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,220,000 is closer to my goal, we're running out of time.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away, and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price than John's offer.  Selling to John guarantees me at least $1,000,000, which is still a significant profit."
