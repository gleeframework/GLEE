"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  To be fair, I've already got a standing offer for that price. Could you do $9,000? I'm willing to let it go for that if we can close the deal today.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm really serious about buying the product if we can settle at my initial offer of $8,000. I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,4,
