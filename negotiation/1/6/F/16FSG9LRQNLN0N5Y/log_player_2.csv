Alice's offer:

I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident that this price will be a fair deal for both of us.

Alice is still too high.  She is trying to meet you halfway, but halfway is still too expensive. You should reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my serious interest in acquiring it. This price point allows for a mutually beneficial agreement and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,000,000. I'm willing to accept this price, but I want to give you a chance to think about it. I'm not willing to go any lower, so this is my final offer at $1,000,000.
