Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still want to try and get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not at a price point that works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,300,000 is not an option. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,320,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer, I'm still more comfortable with selling to John at this point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't get closer to my desired price, I'll likely sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the sense that we may not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm only willing to come down to $1,330,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 1330000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually agreeable price, but $1,330,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer is still too low for me. I'm not confident we can reach a deal that's profitable enough for me, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000."
