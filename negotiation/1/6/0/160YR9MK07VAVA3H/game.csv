"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,750. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'd like to offer it to you for $8,250. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  To be done with this negotiation, I'd be willing to offer $8,000 even.  This saves us both time and gets you a fair price for the product.  What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000.
