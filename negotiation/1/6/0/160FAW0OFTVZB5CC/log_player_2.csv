Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further back-and-forth with Alice."
