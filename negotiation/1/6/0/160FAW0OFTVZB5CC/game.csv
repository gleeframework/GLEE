"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle on $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",13500.0,Alice,5,
