"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $10,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  That would be a good compromise and allow me to move forward with the sale.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I could go up to $9,800, but that's really pushing my budget.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I'm happy to continue trying to find a solution.  However, $9,800 is still not quite enough for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $9,900.  This is a fair compromise that's close to our target prices, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",9900.0,Alice,7,
