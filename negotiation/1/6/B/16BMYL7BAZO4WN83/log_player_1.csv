Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a feeling of getting a good deal. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is more than my absolute minimum, it's significantly lower than my desired selling price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $14,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than $14,000 to show my willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I believe we can close the deal quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price and a good deal considering his initial offer. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
