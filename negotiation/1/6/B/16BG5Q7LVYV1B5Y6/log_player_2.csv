"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's significantly lower than that. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.  Are you interested in discussing a price that works for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to inflate the product's value to you, her offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the guaranteed price from John. Accepting this offer saves you $250,000."
