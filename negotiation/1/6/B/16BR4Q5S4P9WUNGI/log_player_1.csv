Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce to Bob that it's worth a significant amount. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just giving a flat yes or no.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit. It's possible Bob could be put off by the high initial price and walk away. 
* You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get your minimum price if Bob declines."
