"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product from John for $8,000, so you should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still too high, and you're not sure if you'll be able to negotiate her down further.  It's safer to go with John's offer of $8,000."
