"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport.
* **Value proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much. This keeps Bob engaged.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I create space to negotiate downwards if needed. I also want to gauge Bob's initial interest level before revealing more about the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is above my absolute minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **More negotiation potential:** I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation.
* **Avoiding settling too early:** Accepting Bob's offer would lock me into a price that's less than ideal, and there's still room to improve.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating position and signal that I'm willing to continue the conversation. I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable to him, implying he's getting a good deal at $11,000.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly, even though I'm rejecting his offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects again, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we go with $10,750?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Bob's offer is higher than what I'd get from John, but it's still a bit below my desired price point.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to squeeze out a few more dollars with another counteroffer.
* **Not desperate:**  While I could accept and secure a decent profit, I'm not desperate and want to see if I can get closer to my target price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him I'm not ready to settle. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  Let's split the difference one last time. How about $10,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer is a very small concession from my previous counteroffer, showing I'm close to my limit.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  I'm emphasizing the value and satisfaction Bob will get from the product, encouraging him to close the deal.
* **Clear intention:** I'm clearly indicating that I'm ready to settle for this price, but it's the best I can do.

**Strategy:**

By making a final compromise and emphasizing the positive aspects of the deal, I'm aiming to persuade Bob to accept. If he still rejects, I'll have to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
