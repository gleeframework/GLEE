"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate a lower price before buying from John.  You can afford to reject Alice's first offer and see if she'll come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You can still try to get a better deal from Alice. While $11,000 is closer to your maximum, you can still aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we go with $10,750?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  Let's split the difference one last time. How about $10,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is coming down to a price that is only slightly above your ideal. You've successfully negotiated a better price than her initial offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting her offer is the best choice here."
