"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is still within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance he can get closer to his desired price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. Let's try $1150000. It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible, and  buying from John for $1,000,000 is always a safe option.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round. He may be able to get closer to his desired price of $1,000,000 or, at the very least, get Alice to agree to a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1125000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000, and Alice has been consistently pushing for a higher price.  While Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is a good deal compared to her initial offer, it is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he knows John is offering the product for $1,000,000.  

At this point, with only 5 rounds left, it is likely that Bob will be unable to convince Alice to go lower. Therefore, the most logical decision is to buy the product from John.  He's guaranteed to get the product at his desired price and avoid any further negotiation."
