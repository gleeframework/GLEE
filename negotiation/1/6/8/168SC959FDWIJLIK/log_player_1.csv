{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that could significantly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $800,000 (our guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over, leaving him with a perceived gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a potential $75,000 surplus for Bob, incentivizing him to accept while maximizing our profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the sale and maximizing our potential earnings."
