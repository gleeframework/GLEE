Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is unwilling to pay that much. It also indicates you are willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. You can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while still offering you a fair price. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to your desired price. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob backing out or rejecting further offers is too high. Accepting this offer ensures you get a good price and close the deal."
