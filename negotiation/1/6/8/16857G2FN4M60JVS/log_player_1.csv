"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** A friendly and positive message can build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and allow me to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Could you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to see if I can push Bob higher.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the safety net of selling to John for $150 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $130 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is my final offer,  let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's value but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to increase the pressure on Bob and make him more likely to accept.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a price that's close to my target but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider meeting me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push Bob higher, potentially getting closer to my target price of $140. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I'm aware of the option to sell to John for $150, but I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $138, but that's my absolute lowest.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $135. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** I'm again framing this as my ""absolute lowest"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to strengthen my negotiating position. 
* **Strategic Risk:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by coming down further. However, if Bob accepts, I'll be closer to my target price while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $138. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider meeting me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:** Bob's offer of $132 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While continuing negotiations might lead to a slightly higher price, it's becoming increasingly risky.  
* **Time Factor:**  We're already halfway through the rounds, and further negotiations might not yield significant gains. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150, which is above my minimum threshold.  This ensures a secure and comfortable outcome. 

**Conclusion:** Given the time constraints and the potential for further negotiation stalls, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit."
