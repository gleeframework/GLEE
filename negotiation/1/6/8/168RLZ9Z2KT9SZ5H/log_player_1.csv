"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong initial position and allows for potential negotiation room.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware of the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  It's a middle ground that hopefully shows Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while also demonstrating my own value assessment of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to go higher, and continuing to negotiate would risk losing time and potentially not reaching an agreement. 

Selling to John is a guaranteed outcome, and it aligns with my minimum price target."
