Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for your product, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I still think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000 and unwilling to budge.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at that same price, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. It's time to move on to a buyer who recognizes the product's full value or accept the guaranteed offer."
