"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. It also reflects that the product is worth a lot to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure the sale, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's a bit closer to my desired price, but I think I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $8,900. I'm inching closer to Bob's offer but still trying to keep a bit of a margin.  This shows I'm willing to be flexible but also that I believe the product is worth a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my desired price, and we're running out of rounds.  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal.  While I could keep trying to negotiate, the risk of rejection and losing the sale to John outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
