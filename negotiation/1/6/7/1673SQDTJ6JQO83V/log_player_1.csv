"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I can still push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500,  which is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussion. Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly higher than what I would get from John, and it's also closer to my desired price. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
