"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the market value, I'd be willing to pay $1200000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $1200000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time.  However, to show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price is still fair considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. While $1350000 is a better offer, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to offer $1250000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can offer at this time.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is a fair compromise that I believe benefits both of us. Let's aim to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
