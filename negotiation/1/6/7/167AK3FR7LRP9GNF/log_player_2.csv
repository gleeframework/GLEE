Alice's offer:

However, to show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price is still fair considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,200,000."

I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is a fair compromise that I believe benefits both of us. Let's aim to close this deal.

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than the $1,200,000 I can get from John.  I'm not confident I can get Alice lower, so I'll go with John to save the money."
