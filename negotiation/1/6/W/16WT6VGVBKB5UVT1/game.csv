"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm proposing $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. This offer gives us both a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
