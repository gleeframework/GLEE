Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm proposing $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. This offer gives us both a good deal.
