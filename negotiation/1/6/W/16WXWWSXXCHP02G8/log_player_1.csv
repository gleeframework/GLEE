"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob, as I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $13,000? It's still a good price for you, and it gives us a chance to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to $15,000, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay $15,000, so accepting this offer ensures a profit.  Given these factors, accepting the $12,500 offer is the best choice at this point."
