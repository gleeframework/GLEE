# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $140 for it. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product and your appreciation for it. Thank you for considering this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

While $140 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can always buy from John for $150."
