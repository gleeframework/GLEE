"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can only stretch to $950000. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, so I'll sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
