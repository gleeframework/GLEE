I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin while leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in this product at a price higher than my minimum acceptable value."

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
