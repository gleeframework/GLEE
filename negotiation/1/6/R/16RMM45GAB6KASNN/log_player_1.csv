Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid in my initial offer, showing I'm willing to work with Bob. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I get a good price.
* **Explore possibilities:** If he doesn't accept, I can see his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.
* **Have a backup:** I can always switch to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls or doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary.

This allows me to:

* **Keep negotiating:** I can try to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Maintain control:**  I avoid settling for a price I'm unhappy with. 
* **Explore options:** I can still switch to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $130 to $120.
* **Midpoint:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm still expressing my willingness to work with Bob and make the deal happen. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Close the gap:** It increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, moving us closer to a deal.
* **Maintain a strong position:** It doesn't undervalue the product, ensuring I get a decent price. 
* **Avoid stalling:**  It helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
