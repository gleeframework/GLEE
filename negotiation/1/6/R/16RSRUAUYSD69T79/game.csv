"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. Can you consider this?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think the product is worth less than $1,900,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,750,000. Can you consider this?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for a good deal. To be frank, $1,750,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,825,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  Take some time to consider it - I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider this?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
