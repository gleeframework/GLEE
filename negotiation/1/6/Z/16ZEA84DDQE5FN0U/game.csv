"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm starting to think about buying from John, but I'd like to give you one more chance. Can you consider $11000? I think that's the lowest I can go and still feel comfortable with the purchase.",11000.0,Bob,6,,
