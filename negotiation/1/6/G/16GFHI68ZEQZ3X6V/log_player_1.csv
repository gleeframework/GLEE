Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your effort, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. I am willing to offer $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his current offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob for a potentially lower price."
