Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Negotiation Space:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still staying above your $8,000 minimum. 
* **Confident but Fair:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while positioning the price as fair rather than a hard bargain.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is prone to hard bargaining, you might start slightly higher.
* **Market Context:**  Is this a competitive market? If so, a slightly lower price might be strategic."
