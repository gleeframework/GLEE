"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95,  but that's my final offer.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can meet you halfway between $95 and $110, which would be $102.50. Is that something you'd be interested in?",102.5,Alice,5,,
