"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. Would you like to make an initial offer?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today if the price is right.  How about we split the difference and call it $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm not willing to go much lower, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,7,
