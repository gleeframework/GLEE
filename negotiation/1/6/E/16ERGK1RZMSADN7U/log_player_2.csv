"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $110. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a significant counteroffer:**  This shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and are not just going to accept her initial price.
* **$95 is a fair starting point:** It's below your maximum price of $120 and allows room for some back-and-forth. 
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive and helps avoid potential friction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle is a good compromise.** Alice has moved closer to your price, and $100 is a reasonable deal for both of us.
* **Saving money:** You're getting the product for $20 less than you were initially prepared to pay.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to bargain might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting frustrated and backing out or you ending up buying from John."
