"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it presents a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer is $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant reduction while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The counteroffer is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also aiming to save money.
* **Open-ended Message:** The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Alice to counter if she's not happy with the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position but I can't accept anything below $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's cheaper than buying from John for $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has come down from her initial price of $11,500.  Bob has already made a counteroffer and pushed for a lower price. It's likely further negotiation won't bring the price down much further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob might be able to push for a slightly lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject the counteroffer, and then he'll have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures the product for a decent price."
