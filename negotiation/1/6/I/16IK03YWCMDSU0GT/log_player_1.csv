Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, and this is a competitive offer."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). It leaves room for negotiation while still being appealing. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable, even with a slightly lower profit margin, compared to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This offer assumes I don't have information about Bob's negotiation style or how urgently he needs the product. More information could lead to a different offer."
