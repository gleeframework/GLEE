"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his range and can adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for that low, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can push him closer to my $15,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $15,500. It's a small increment, but I'm hoping it's enough to signal that I'm serious about getting as close to my desired price as possible without giving up on the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to weigh my options carefully. While Bob is getting closer with his offers, I'm starting to run out of time. I've already rejected several offers below my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can push him any higher. 

Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum price. While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it's a safe and secure deal.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether."
