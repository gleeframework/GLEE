"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll offer $8,500. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8500.0,Bob,4,
