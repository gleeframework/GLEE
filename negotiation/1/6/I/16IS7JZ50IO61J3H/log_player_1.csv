{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, at $100, as I want to maximize my profit. I'm also using friendly language to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.  I'm ready to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92.  While I was hoping for a little more, $92 is a good price and higher than John's offer.  It's time to close the deal!"
