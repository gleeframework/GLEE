(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $90 when you can get it from John for $80.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

Let's start with a price that's a bit lower than what John is offering.  This should give Alice some room to negotiate while still saving us some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is closer to my max,  I'm still not willing to pay that much when I can get it from John for $80. Let's see if we can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

Let's see if Alice will meet me at my maximum price. If she doesn't, I'll just buy from John."
