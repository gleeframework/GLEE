{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 10250}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic, but I'm not ready to give up on a higher price yet."

This is the final round and I need to make a decision. Bob keeps offering $9,500, which is getting closer to my desired price. However, it's still less than my minimum, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement in the next two rounds.  

I've decided to sell to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than getting stuck in a negotiation that might end with me getting less than my minimum. I'm also running out of time, and I want to avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
