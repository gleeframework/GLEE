The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $15,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $8,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than her offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."

I'm offering Alice $9,500.  This is closer to her asking price and shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still below my maximum."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed price, and I'm not confident I can get Alice to go lower."
