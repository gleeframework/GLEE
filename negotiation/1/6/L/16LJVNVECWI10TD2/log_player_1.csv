Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but there's no guarantee another buyer will offer that much after Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or feel like he's getting a deal if he accepts the initial offer. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), giving him an incentive to negotiate down.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Alice has a backup plan with John, making her less desperate to make the sale to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring Alice gets a fair price for her product."
