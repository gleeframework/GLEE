"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,150?  I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,975. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10975.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair.  $10,975 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,062.50?  That's a reasonable compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",11062.5,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,975 and $11,062.50, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,950. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,950 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $11,000?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our remaining time.",11000.0,Alice,7,
