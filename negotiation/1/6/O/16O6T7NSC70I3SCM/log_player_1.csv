"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still within a range that might be considered reasonable for a product worth $1,000,000 to me. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimated value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Not Desperate:** I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately, as I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Round:** I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, perhaps $1,100,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my own financial goals."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by dropping my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000,  which is a significant drop but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Clear Justification:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and my own financial needs.
* **Positive Language:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing that the deal is still advantageous for Bob.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that allows me to get as close to my desired price as possible without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer you $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still below it.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more during the negotiation process.  There's potential for Bob to come up a bit higher.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to give up the potential to earn a bit more if there's a chance of Bob accepting a higher price.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my minimum, perhaps $990,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get close to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  It's very close to your offer, and it allows me to stay closer to my target price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $990,000, which shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the fact that this offer is very close to Bob's last offer, making it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, as he's getting the product for a price below its estimated value.

**Strategy:** By making a small concession and emphasizing the compromise, I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $990,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, which is still a bit lower than your offer. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Line:** While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it seems unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly further.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.

**Decision:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most secure option.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial desired price, it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing the opportunity to sell to John and get nothing at all."
