Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is reflective of its true worth and the value it will bring you. I'm open to discussing this further and answering any questions you might have."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high. A starting price of $2,250,000 gives you significant room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" without being overly specific. This framing can make a high price more palatable.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to discuss the price, showing flexibility and potentially encouraging Bob to counter-offer rather than outright rejecting the initial proposal.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  A lot depends on your knowledge of Bob (his negotiation style, how badly he needs the product) and your own risk tolerance.  You could start lower to ensure a quicker sale, but the potential profit might be less."
