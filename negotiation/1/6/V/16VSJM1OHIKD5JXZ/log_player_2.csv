Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  It's truly unique and has the potential to significantly boost your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
