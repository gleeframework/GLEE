"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  It's truly unique and has the potential to significantly boost your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,250,000? This price still gives me some wiggle room to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
