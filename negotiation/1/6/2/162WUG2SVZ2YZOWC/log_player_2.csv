It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Even if the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John."

I'm offering $125, which is still a good deal for Alice since it's above her minimum. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation."

I'm offering $130.  It's a compromise and closer to Alice's price, but still under my maximum. This should be a good negotiation point."

Alice's offer is getting too close to my maximum, and I don't want to risk going any higher.  It's better to go with John's offer and guarantee the product at my desired price."
