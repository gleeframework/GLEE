{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. Alice's offer of $9,500 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before going with John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}

This counteroffer increases your offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still below Alice's offer. It shows that you're willing to compromise, while still trying to get a better price than her last offer. It also sets the stage for potential middle ground in the next few rounds."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is getting close to your target price, but it's still not ideal.  You have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal, especially since Alice is likely motivated to close the deal.  You still have room to counteroffer and might be able to secure a price closer to your $8,000 goal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but you're still not satisfied.  This counteroffer demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate but are firm on getting a price closer to your desired $8,000.  You're aiming to push Alice towards a deal that's more favorable for you while still leaving room for potential compromise in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is just $750 more than your desired price. It's a good deal, considering you have limited rounds left and could potentially lose out on the opportunity if you continue to negotiate.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product, rather than risk getting a worse deal or running out of time."
