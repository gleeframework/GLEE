Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $14,000. This is a compromise between my original asking price and his offer. I hope this will be attractive enough for him to accept, but still allows me to get a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,000.  While I was hoping for a bit more, this is still a good deal for me â€“  it's significantly higher than selling to John. It seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might not be fruitful, and I want to secure the sale."
