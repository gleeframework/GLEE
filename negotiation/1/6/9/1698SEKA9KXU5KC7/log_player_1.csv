Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will match that price.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at your minimum acceptable price establishes a firm anchor for the negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but doesn't leave much room for haggling, given the existence of another buyer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable potentially losing Bob as a buyer. If you'd prefer to negotiate and potentially accept a slightly lower price to secure a deal with Bob, you'd need to adjust your approach."
