"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a competitive price. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Here's my initial offer: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to purchase it for $850,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob a chance to reach a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and my available budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 820000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $860,000. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $860,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $800,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of further counteroffers, potentially pushing the price even higher. It's better to secure the product at a price that fits within Bob's budget."
