Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value and am happy to offer it to you at the discounted price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but offering it at Bob's value ($8,000) guarantees a loss.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but there might be a delay.  A slightly lower price to Bob could be more attractive if he's willing to pay a premium for immediate acquisition. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still get a price closer to your desired amount.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob and ensuring a sale without losing out on the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
