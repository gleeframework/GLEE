"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth discussing the price, and I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I think a fairer price would be around $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit off from my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,025,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great price for a product of this caliber, and I think you'll find it a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
