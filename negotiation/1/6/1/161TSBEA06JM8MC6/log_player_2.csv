Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $8,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation.  Accepting the offer gets you the product at your target price."
