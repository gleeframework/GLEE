"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $7,000? That's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $8,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
