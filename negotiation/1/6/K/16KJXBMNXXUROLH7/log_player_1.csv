Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1300000} 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my valuation, but I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  It's also a price that still offers Bob a good deal compared to his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'll counteroffer, but I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if I don't get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's also a step down from my initial offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal than $1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer. This shows I'm open to negotiation, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum price. I'm going to sell to John and secure a much better deal."
