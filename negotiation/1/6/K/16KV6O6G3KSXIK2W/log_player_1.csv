Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he should be willing to pay a little more than my minimum price.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to take such a big loss. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a good profit. If Bob is serious about buying the product, he should be willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a little low, but it's getting closer to my desired price.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk him walking away entirely or having to deal with more rounds of negotiation.  $125 is still a good profit and it saves me time and effort."
