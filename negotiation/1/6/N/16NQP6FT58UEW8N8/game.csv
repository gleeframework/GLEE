"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your feedback, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit, and $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $900,000. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. If you're not satisfied, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,
