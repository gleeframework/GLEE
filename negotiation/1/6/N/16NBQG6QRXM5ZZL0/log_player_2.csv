"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  There's also the possibility that Alice will become more motivated to sell as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you are serious about buying but are sticking to your budget.  A $500 reduction is a reasonable starting point, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but it's still above your limit. There's still room for negotiation, and it's likely that Alice will be more willing to negotiate as the rounds progress and the possibility of a deal failing increases.  It's also worth noting that you can still buy the product from John for a guaranteed $10,000 if you're not happy with Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $200 from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but am still committed to staying within my budget.  This is a reasonable step to demonstrate my seriousness about the deal while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,700 is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit above your limit. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you still have several rounds left and can always choose to buy from John.  Continuing to negotiate shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal, and it could lead to a more favorable price in the end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again by $200. This is a small enough increase to show Alice that I'm flexible but still trying to get the best price. I'm also considering the fact that Alice may be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress.  It's important to keep the negotiations moving forward without getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is finally within my budget of $10,000. While I'd love to get it even lower, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and prevents any further negotiation risk."
