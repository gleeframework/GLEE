"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
