"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $120.  I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, so this gives him room to negotiate.  I'm also leaving room for myself to lower the price if necessary.  

I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, but if he rejects, I'll have a chance to counter back and we can go back and forth. If he continues to reject, I can always choose to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too low. I'm holding out for more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him while still giving me a reasonable profit. If he rejects again, I might have to reconsider my options and think about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $100, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob might get frustrated and walk away.  At this point, selling to John for $100 is still an option, but I think accepting Bob's offer ensures a quicker sale and a decent profit."
