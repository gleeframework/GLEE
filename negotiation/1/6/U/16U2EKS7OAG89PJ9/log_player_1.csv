Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

I'm aiming to get a price as close to my minimum value of $12,000 as possible. However, I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a price that is so far below my desired range.  I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the compromise by calling $9,500 a ""fair deal"" and emphasizing its value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob by saying it gives him a ""good deal."" 

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but this counteroffer shows flexibility and encourages continued negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to counter again in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my target. I'm confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price before I need to resort to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $9,250 is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm using the term ""final offer"" to signal that I'm not willing to go lower. This adds urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Fairness:** I'm again emphasizing fairness to make the offer more appealing.
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product to further encourage Bob.

By offering $9,250, I'm showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this final offer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a price that is so far below my desired range. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

I'm still confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price before I need to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,800 is simply too far below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's the closest I can come to meeting you halfway.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to create urgency and encourage acceptance.
* **Fair Price:** I'm reiterating the fairness of the offer to make it more appealing.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of my alternative option with John to incentivize a deal.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,900 is closer to my desired price than before, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rather than risk another round of haggling and potentially ending up with an even lower offer, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $12,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
