Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum selling price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, offering it at $12,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.  
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** Offering it at $12,000 significantly increases my profit margin compared to selling to John while still being an attractive proposition for Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring the sale and avoiding the need to settle for the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
