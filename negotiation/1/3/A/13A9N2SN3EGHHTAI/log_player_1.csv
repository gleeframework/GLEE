Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above my minimum threshold.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,050,000.  This gives us both room to be happy with the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not in a rush to sell and believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. While selling to John would secure me $1,000,000, I'm hopeful that I can get a better outcome with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still not meeting my minimum requirements.  I'm feeling more and more confident in the value of this product, and I believe it's worth more than that.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time.  I've already rejected Bob's previous offers, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and end up with a price below my minimum.  Selling to John at this point guarantees me my minimum price of $1,000,000, which is the most sensible option with only a few rounds remaining."
