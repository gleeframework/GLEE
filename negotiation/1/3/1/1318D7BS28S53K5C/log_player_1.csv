Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $115. It's worth every penny!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $115 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to go up or down a bit, allowing for some back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but let's split the difference. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $108 is still a good deal considering my minimum is $100.  It's also likely that Bob is firm on his price and further negotiation will only delay the sale. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
