"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $14,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's better to reject the offer and try for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, offering $13,500.
* **Better than John:**  $13,500 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  There are only 7 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it risks losing the deal entirely or running out of time.

Accepting the offer at $13,500 is a good compromise and secures the product within Bob's budget."
