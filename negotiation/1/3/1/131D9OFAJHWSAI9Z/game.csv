"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
