Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is the best way to maximize my profit while still leaving space for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but still below my desired price.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to meet my needs.  To ensure I secure the best possible price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
