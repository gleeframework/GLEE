"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is close to my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160, still higher than my minimum but showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155} 
```

I'm reducing my price again to $155. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm also mindful of the limited rounds left and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm running out of time and rounds. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a worse outcome."
