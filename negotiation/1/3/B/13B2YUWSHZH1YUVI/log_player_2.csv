"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that I believe represents a fair value for both of us.  I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and while I value it at no less than $800,000, I'm willing to negotiate a price that works for us both.  Please consider my offer of $900,000.  This allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount, and me to earn a profit exceeding my minimum threshold.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
