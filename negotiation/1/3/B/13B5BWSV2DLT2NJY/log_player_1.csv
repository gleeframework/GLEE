""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $120. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum.  
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price."
