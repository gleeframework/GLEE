Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth a guaranteed $1,000,000 to Alice (from John), she can afford to start with a higher asking price.  
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product, especially if it's unique or in high demand. A starting price of $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything. She has a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no immediate need to sell the product quickly. If she needs the $1,000,000 immediately, it's safer to offer it to Bob at that price to guarantee the sale."
