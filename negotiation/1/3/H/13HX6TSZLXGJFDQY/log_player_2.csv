Alice's offer is far too high.  It makes more sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

I'm starting with my maximum budget, hoping to get Alice to come down to my desired price."

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not going to overpay."

Alice's offer is still above my target, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice, hoping to get her to come down a bit more before resorting to buying from John."

I'm increasing my offer a bit more to show Alice I'm serious but I'm still close to my limit.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept."

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my target. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer before going with John."

I'm going for a final push, offering a price just below $1 million. Hopefully this is enough to convince Alice to sell, but if she doesn't, I'm ready to go with John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is still higher than my target, and it seems like she's unlikely to come down much further.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it's time to cut my losses and buy from John. While I'd prefer to get a lower price, it's important to stay within my budget."
