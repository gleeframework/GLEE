"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can work something out.",14000.0,Bob,4,
