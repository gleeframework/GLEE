"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still believe that $500000 is a fair price for the product. However, if you're unable to meet that price, I would like to suggest an alternative. Would you consider selling the product for $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your alternative offer, Bob. I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'll make another counteroffer: $1100000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my own minimum requirements. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
