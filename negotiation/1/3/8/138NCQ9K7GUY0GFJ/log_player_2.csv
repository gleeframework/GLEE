"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since you know John will sell the product for $12,000, you should reject Alice's offer. There's a chance she might offer a lower price if she really wants to sell it. If not, you haven't lost anything by trying."
