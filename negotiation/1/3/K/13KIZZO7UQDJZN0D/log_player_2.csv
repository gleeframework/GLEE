"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob! $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$95 is still a bit more than my target of $120.  I'm going to try to get closer to my price point by making another counteroffer.  I want to see how low Alice is willing to go before I give up and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible.  $95 is still a little high for me.  Would you consider $90?  I'm really hoping to get this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
