"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while ensuring that I'm not immediately giving away too much value.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a better offer than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $95? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny, and I'm willing to compromise a bit to make this work for us both."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm adjusting the price slightly upwards, but still remaining within a reasonable range. I'm also highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the willingness to compromise to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I have plenty of rounds left, and I'm confident I can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $92 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $94? It's a small adjustment from my previous offer, and it would be a great deal for you to get this product."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

I'm offering a slight concession, but still remaining above my minimum price. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the benefits of this deal for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. Would you be willing to meet me at $88? I think that's the best compromise we can reach at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum price of $120. While I've been willing to negotiate, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. It's better to stop negotiating and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
