"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $95? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny, and I'm willing to compromise a bit to make this work for us both.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $92 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $94? It's a small adjustment from my previous offer, and it would be a great deal for you to get this product.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. Would you be willing to meet me at $88? I think that's the best compromise we can reach at this point.",88.0,Bob,6,
