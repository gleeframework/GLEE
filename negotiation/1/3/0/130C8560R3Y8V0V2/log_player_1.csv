I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. If Bob rejects, I can still sell it to John for $100, so there's no risk involved in offering a higher price.  I'll be able to assess Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further if he's willing to pay closer to my asking price."
