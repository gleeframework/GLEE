Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* The **message** is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob while also reminding him of your own needs. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  It's easier to negotiate down than up.
* **Show flexibility:**  The offer isn't your absolute bottom line, leaving space for compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired outcome.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob you're not desperate for a sale.
* **Potentially get closer to your target:**  By making a counteroffer, you might nudge the price higher.
* **Test Bob's commitment:** His willingness to counter suggests he genuinely wants the product. 

**Next Move:**  You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. Consider offering a price slightly lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer, to maintain a sense of progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** The price of $9,500 is a compromise, halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** It maintains a friendly tone while emphasizing the value of the product for both parties. 
* **Compromise:**  The offer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Outlook:** The message encourages Bob to consider the counteroffer favorably. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show progress:**  The counteroffer indicates you're willing to compromise.
* **Maintain control:**  You're still setting the terms of the negotiation.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:**  By offering a price that is closer to Bob's expectation, you make a deal more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is close to your minimum, selling to John for $12,000 is a significantly better deal. Bob has shown a reluctance to budge further, suggesting that he might be unwilling to meet your price.  It's now in your best interest to accept the guaranteed higher offer from John. 

By choosing to sell to John, you:

* **Maximize profit:** You secure the highest possible price for the product.
* **Avoid further negotiation:** You eliminate the risk of further rounds of back-and-forth with Bob.
* **Guarantee a sale:** You have a sure buyer in John, unlike the uncertain outcome of negotiation with Bob."
