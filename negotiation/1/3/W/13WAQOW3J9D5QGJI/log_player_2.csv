"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  This leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm open to discussing other possibilities.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than the product's worth to you ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is appreciated, but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my asking price, I'm still hoping to find a number that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $950,000, which is still above your desired price, but it's within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  Buying from Alice at this price saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
