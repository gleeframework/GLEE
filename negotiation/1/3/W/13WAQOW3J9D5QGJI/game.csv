"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  This leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm open to discussing other possibilities.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is appreciated, but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my asking price, I'm still hoping to find a number that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
