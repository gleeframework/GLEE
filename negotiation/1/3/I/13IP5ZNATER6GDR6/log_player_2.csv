"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's start with a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is starting at $9,500. 
* **Negotiation is likely.** There's room for both of you to find a price that works.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. To better align with your budget, I am willing to consider $9,200 as the price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction.** She lowered the price from $9,500 to $9,200. 
* **Still room for negotiation.** You're aiming for $9,000, and there's still a gap. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target price. 
* **You have more rounds.**  You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,100?  It's a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9100}
