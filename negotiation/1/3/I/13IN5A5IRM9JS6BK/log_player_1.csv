{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $1,630,000 is only $10,000 below my last offer. It's a small difference, and I'm nearing my desired price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Accepting for now:**  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

**Strategy:** 

* I'm evaluating the potential of continuing the negotiation versus the risk of losing the deal. 
* While I could try for a slightly higher price, I'm choosing to secure a solid profit and avoid any potential losses. 
* This decision acknowledges that negotiation is about finding a mutually beneficial outcome, and sometimes accepting a slightly less than ideal offer is the best strategy."
