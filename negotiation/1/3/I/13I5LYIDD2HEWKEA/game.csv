"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $145? It's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
