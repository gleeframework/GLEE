"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a fair offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, we are still quite far apart in our valuations. I could go up to $900,000, but that's my limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,750,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to reach a deal with you while still recognizing the product's inherent value.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's absolutely my limit. I understand this is a valuable product, but I need to stick to my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I have to be honest -  $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I've already made significant concessions to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. If you're able to meet me at $1,600,000, I'm willing to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I need to consider my other option.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
