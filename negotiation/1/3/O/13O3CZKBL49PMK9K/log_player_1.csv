Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John for $150. The difference is significant enough to make the extra negotiation time and effort not worthwhile."
