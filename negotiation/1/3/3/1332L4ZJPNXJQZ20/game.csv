"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to purchase it from me for $25000?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000. This is my maximum offer.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $16000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, but I need you to meet me halfway.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that we're close, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting a bit discouraged.  $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I really need you to meet me at least halfway on this.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet at $14500?",14500.0,Alice,9,
