"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to purchase it from me for $25000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. This is my maximum offer.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $18000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high, though it's a step in the right direction. It's worth making a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet at $16000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a better offer, I'm still not ready to accept. I'll try to get closer to my goal of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but I need you to meet me halfway.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that we're close, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting a bit discouraged.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I really need you to meet me at least halfway on this.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet at $14500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $14,500 is close to my ideal price, we're in the final round and there's no guarantee Alice will accept my next counteroffer. Given my maximum budget is $8,000, it's safer to buy from John for a guaranteed price."
