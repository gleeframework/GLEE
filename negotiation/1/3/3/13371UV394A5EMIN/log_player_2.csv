"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  He has a clear alternative with John at $1,000,000, so he should push Alice lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position. While $1,250,000 is closer to his target, he can still potentially get a better deal by pushing Alice further.  He has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, which gives him leverage in negotiations with Alice.  Rejecting this offer allows him to counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
