Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $8,500. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a good compromise for me.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to get it lower. He should counteroffer again and see if he can secure a better deal."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He should counteroffer again and see if he can secure a better deal.  It's important to remember that he has the option to buy from John for $12,000, so he doesn't need to accept a price he's not comfortable with."
