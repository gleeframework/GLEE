I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $120. This is the price at which the product is worth it to me, and I'm not willing to pay more.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for her, but I'm also prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $120.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and I'm not willing to risk going over my budget."
