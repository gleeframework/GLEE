"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $12000? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $9000. This would allow us both to have a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9000. How about we meet in the middle between $9000 and $12000? I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a fair price for a product of this quality and I think you'll be happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you're willing to come down, but $10500 is still above what I can comfortably afford right now.  How about we try $9500? This would be a good middle ground and we can both walk away happy with the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,,
