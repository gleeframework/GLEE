"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $140. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $160. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
