Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a potential profit of $300,000 over my guaranteed minimum with John.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could aim for a higher price, I'm balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of a larger profit.
* **John's Offer:** Knowing John will pay $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows me to be more aggressive with my offer to Bob. 
* **Unknown Value:** I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product. A higher offer might tempt him, but also increases the chance of rejection.

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing profit and avoiding a scenario where I'm forced to accept John's lower price."
