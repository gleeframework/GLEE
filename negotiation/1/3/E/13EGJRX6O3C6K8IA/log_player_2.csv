"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a valuable product at a price lower than its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the product's value to you, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, saving you $200,000."
