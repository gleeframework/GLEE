Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the possibility of wider interest (""before I list it publicly""). This could make Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $20,000, the tone suggests openness to discussion. If Bob counters, you have room to negotiate down towards your minimum while still aiming for a higher profit."
