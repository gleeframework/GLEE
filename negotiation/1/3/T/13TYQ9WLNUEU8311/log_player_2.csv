Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to bring the price down further."
