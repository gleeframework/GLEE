"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You can do better than $10,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
