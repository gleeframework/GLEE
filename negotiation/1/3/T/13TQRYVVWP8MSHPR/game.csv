"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. This product would be worth $10,000 to me.  Would you consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While I appreciate you coming down, $14,000 is still more than I'd like to pay. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
