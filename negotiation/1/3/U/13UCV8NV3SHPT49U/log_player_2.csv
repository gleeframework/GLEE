"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,150,000.  Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there is room for negotiation.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident this product will yield significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  $1,100,000 is still higher than his target, and there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to a price closer to his desired $1,050,000."
