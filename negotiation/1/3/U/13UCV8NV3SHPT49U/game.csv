"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident this product will yield significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
