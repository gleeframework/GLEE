"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows you to make a good profit. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you a good profit while staying within my budget.  Let's reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is a lot closer, but I'm still stuck at my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my final offer.  I think this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm willing to make one last push. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500, but I'm only offering this because I really want to close the deal. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final counteroffer.",10500.0,Alice,9,
