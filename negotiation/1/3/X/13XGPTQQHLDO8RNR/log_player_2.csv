Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $795000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $795,000 is now very close to your counteroffer of $775,000. Accepting this offer will result in a good deal, saving you a significant amount compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might be possible, but the potential savings are unlikely to be substantial enough to warrant the risk of losing the deal."
