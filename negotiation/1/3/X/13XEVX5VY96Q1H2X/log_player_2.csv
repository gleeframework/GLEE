You should reject Alice's offer. It's above your maximum budget, and you have a better alternative with John.  By rejecting, you can start a negotiation with Alice and potentially get a better price."

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget. Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
