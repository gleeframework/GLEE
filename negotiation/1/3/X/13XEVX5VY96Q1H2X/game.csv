"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and it leaves room for both of us to make a deal. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make this work, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $825,000 is a fair price that benefits us both. It's closer to my budget and leaves some room for us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",825000.0,Bob,4,
