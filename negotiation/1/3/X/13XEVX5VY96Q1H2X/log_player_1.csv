Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** By starting high, I create space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining my floor:**  I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000, so I have a fallback option if Bob doesn't meet my price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and it leaves room for both of us to make a deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my floor:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, given that he's already shown interest in the product.
* **Protecting my interests:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome. However, I want to maximize my profit, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** My counteroffer of $875,000 splits the difference between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my floor:** $875,000 is still above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price allows ""both of us to walk away happy,"" reinforcing the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and persuasive tone, encouraging Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make this work, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $825,000 is a fair price that benefits us both. It's closer to my budget and leaves some room for us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Further negotiation unlikely to yield significant gains:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a high chance that Bob won't budge much further.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price.

**Conclusion:** Given the current situation, selling to John is the most sensible decision to maximize my profit and minimize the risk of a lower price."
