Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting very close.  There's a risk that he'll walk away entirely or that I'll run out of rounds before we reach a deal. It's time to secure the sale and accept his offer."
