"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $19,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $19,000 is far above his budget of $12,000, and there's no reason to accept such a high price when he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product, but $19,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $19,000 is based on the real value of this product. How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing this is important to you. I'm willing to make one more significant move to get this done. How about $13,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he still has John as an option for $12,000. It's worth pushing for that price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  My final offer is $12,000. If you can't meet that, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 12000}
