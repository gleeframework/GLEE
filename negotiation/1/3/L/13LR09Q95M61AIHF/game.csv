"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $8,200 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $8,400 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,5,
