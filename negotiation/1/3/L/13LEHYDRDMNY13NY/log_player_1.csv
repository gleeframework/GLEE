Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly above my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to encourage him to counteroffer if he's not willing to pay $120, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for higher profit:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, hopefully leading to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Highlighting value to Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to make him more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $95 is significantly closer to my desired price point than selling to John for $80.
* **No guarantee of a better offer:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a further counteroffer, and I risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time, and I need to weigh the potential extra profit against the opportunity cost.

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer at $95 is the most financially advantageous decision."
