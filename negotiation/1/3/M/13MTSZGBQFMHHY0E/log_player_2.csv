"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my desired price point. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a lower price.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $800,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it,  given its unique nature. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to overpay. I've chosen a price that's a bit lower than what I'd be willing to pay from John, but leaves room for some potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies above $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's rarity and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a good compromise, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I still have 7 rounds left. There's a chance I can get a lower price, especially since I'm not in a rush to buy from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but I don't think I can go higher.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price while still showing willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, but it demonstrates that I'm still trying to get the best deal. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value lies above $700000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's rarity and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is closer to my desired price range.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I've already gone through a few rounds and need to be mindful of time. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
