"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a special price of $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his own value of the product ($12,000). This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing his seriousness about getting a good deal. It also leaves room for potential negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500. I'll offer the product to you for $8,250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,250, which is a fair price for Bob. It's well within his budget of $12,000 and significantly lower than John's price. There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on is too high. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and secures the product within his budget."
