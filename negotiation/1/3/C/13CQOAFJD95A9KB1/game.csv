"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true value.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my understanding of the market value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. To demonstrate my seriousness about acquiring the product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
