"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000.  This shows a willingness to negotiate, but still ensures I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of rounds, and it's not worth risking losing the deal with John for a potential $200 profit."
