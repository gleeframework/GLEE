"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you set a strong anchor. This might make your later concessions seem more significant and potentially influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and potential counteroffers, signaling a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Optionality:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn significantly more from Bob. This strategy keeps that possibility open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the opportunity to purchase your product. I understand its value, but I am only able to offer $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches his perceived value, which is significantly below your minimum.  Accepting now would mean a substantial loss. You have room to negotiate and John provides a safety net, so it's best to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a considerable return on investment. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Dropping by $300,000 from your initial offer might signal to Bob that you're serious about negotiating. However, the price remains substantially above his initial offer and your minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Reiterating the product's value helps justify the high price and potentially shifts Bob's perception.
* **Maintaining Distance from John's Offer:**  While John offers a safe $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. This counter-offer keeps that door open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe the product should be within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now higher than John's guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate upwards, indicating serious interest.  
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  While you could counter again, there's a chance Bob might reduce his offer or walk away entirely, leaving you with John's lower price.

It's a good business decision to accept a strong offer on the table, especially when it exceeds your alternative option."
