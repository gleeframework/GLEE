"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $82 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal under $80, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $75. How about we meet at $79? It's a small compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",79.0,Alice,5,
