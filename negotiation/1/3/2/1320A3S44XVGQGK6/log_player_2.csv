"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and importance to you, I propose a special offer. For this exceptional item, I am extending a price of $9500. This is a significant discount from the original value, making it an attractive opportunity for you to acquire something that holds immense worth for you. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you require further details about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not by much.**  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, it still represents a cost above your ideal price point.
* **You have leverage.** Since John is willing to sell for $10,000, you can use this as a bargaining chip to potentially get Alice to come down further. 

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you are willing to walk away. This increases your chances of a counter-offer closer to your ideal price."
