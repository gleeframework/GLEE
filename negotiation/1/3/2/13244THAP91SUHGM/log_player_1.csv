Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 allows me to potentially negotiate down to a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **John as a Backup:**  The knowledge of John's offer provides me with a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, or make a counteroffer closer to my minimum. If the negotiation stalls or Bob makes an unacceptable offer, I will move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm confident that I can get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me leverage to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still keeping the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes the negotiation seem more fair.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This ensures that I'm not giving away too much in the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, hoping to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider making a final counteroffer at $14,000. However, if he makes an unacceptable offer again, I will likely move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers keep getting lower. There's a high chance we won't be able to reach an agreement.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, making it a better option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will sell the product to John, as it ensures I receive my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
