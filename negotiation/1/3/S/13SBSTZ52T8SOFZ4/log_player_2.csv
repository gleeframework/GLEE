"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
