"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?  I believe this would still be a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,050,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would still be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $1,062,500.  This would still be a substantial profit for you and allow me to purchase the product within my spending limit.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
