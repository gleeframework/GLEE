"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $90? That would be a price I'm comfortable with.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $100, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
