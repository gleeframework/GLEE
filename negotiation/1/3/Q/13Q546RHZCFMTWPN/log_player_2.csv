# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $9,500 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

**Reasoning:** Alice seems pretty stuck on a price above my limit. It's unlikely she'll go below $9,000, and I have a guaranteed option at $8,000 with John. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
