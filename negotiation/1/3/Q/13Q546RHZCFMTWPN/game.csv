"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $9,500 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
