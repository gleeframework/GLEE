"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount.  I'm really interested in this product, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to go up to $710,000 for the product.  This would be a good middle ground, and it would allow us to finalize the sale quickly. What do you think?",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000, which is just a small step away from your target price. I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while still being reasonable. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,
