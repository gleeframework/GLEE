"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  I'm also setting a high initial price to see if I can capitalize on any potential eagerness from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can still get a better price than $900,000 from Bob or potentially from John if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and is considerably higher than Bob's offer. This move shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for such a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's only $50,000 more than what I could get from John, but I'm choosing to accept it. There are a few reasons for this:

* **Time is a factor:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob takes time and there's no guarantee we'll reach a higher price. 
* **Uncertainty:** I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob or if John might withdraw his offer later.
* **Potentially higher future value:** There's a chance that Bob might be a more valuable customer in the future, and building a good relationship with him now could lead to more profitable deals later on.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $1,050,000 seems like the most logical decision given the circumstances."
