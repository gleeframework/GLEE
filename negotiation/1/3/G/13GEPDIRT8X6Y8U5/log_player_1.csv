Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its value, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects that. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Bob's interest and gives Alice a sense of how much he might be willing to pay above the minimum value. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob.  

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while considering the potential for a successful negotiation with Bob."
