Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice hints at the product's worth without explicitly stating a number, giving Bob a chance to consider its worth to him.
* **Creating Urgency:** By stating she'll list it publicly if Bob declines, Alice introduces a mild sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While Alice starts at $15,000, she doesn't anchor too aggressively. This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and for Alice to potentially still meet her $12,000 minimum."
