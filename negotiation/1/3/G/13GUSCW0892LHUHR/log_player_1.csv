Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that is:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  This ensures you make more than you would with John.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  This makes the deal attractive to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  Keeps it professional, highlights the product's value, and creates a sense of exclusivity.
* **The Price:** $1,350,000. This gives you a significant profit margin ($350,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a good deal ($150,000 below his perceived value).

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer.  Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Confidence:** Present your offer with confidence. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value."
