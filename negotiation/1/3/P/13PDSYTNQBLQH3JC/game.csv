"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $9,000? That's a good compromise, and it still gives you a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",8200.0,Bob,4,
