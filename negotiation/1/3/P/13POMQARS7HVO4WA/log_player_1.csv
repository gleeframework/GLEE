Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting potential benefits for Bob.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($150) but will be prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 
* I'm also aware of the John option, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  
* Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
*  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate further, but I will not accept a price that is significantly below my minimum. 
* I have the John option as a fallback, which guarantees me at least $150."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $140, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us.
*  I'm remaining optimistic and emphasizing the value of the product. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider his next counteroffer, but I'll be ready to move on to John if needed."
