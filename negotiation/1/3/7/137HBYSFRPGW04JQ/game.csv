"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a fair price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's closer to our respective price points. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
