"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will give me room to negotiate and gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for higher. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering a price of $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $920,000 is a good compromise, especially considering the limited rounds remaining.  It's closer to my ideal price than John's offer, and I'm confident I can't achieve a significantly better outcome in the remaining rounds."
