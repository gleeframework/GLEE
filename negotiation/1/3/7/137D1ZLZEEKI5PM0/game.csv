"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $16,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it gets us closer to what I need.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $14,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,4,
