Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. You can also see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $750000 is a good offer, it's a bit below what I need to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?
