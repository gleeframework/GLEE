"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which is still a significant amount. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $750000 is a good offer, it's a bit below what I need to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $850000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800000.  This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
