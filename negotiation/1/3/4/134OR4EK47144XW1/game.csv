"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if you're interested in accepting this offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
