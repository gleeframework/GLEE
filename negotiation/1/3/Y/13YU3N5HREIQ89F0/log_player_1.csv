"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial benchmark and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, and I'm aiming to get as close to that value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value through further negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value, but I'm willing to compromise to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure with the number of rounds passing, $700,000 is simply too low. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum value of $800,000 by continuing the negotiation. Selling to John is still an option, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can sway Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping it will convince Bob to accept. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting risky. Bob keeps lowering the price, and while I'm still hoping for a better deal, I'm not confident I can get closer to my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. At least I'll secure my minimum price and avoid the risk of losing even more money in further negotiations."
