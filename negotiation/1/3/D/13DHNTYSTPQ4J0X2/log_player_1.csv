"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum desired price.  It's important to be aggressive early on to secure the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could accept and get something, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is still above my minimum price of $1,500,000 but shows a willingness to compromise. I want to gauge Bob's seriousness about buying the product and see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum price. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him."
