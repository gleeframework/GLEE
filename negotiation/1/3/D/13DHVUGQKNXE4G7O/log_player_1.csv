Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's something I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,250,000. This price reflects its high value and my confidence in its potential for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate and leaving me some wiggle room.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential for Bob, making him more inclined to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit while still incentivizing Bob to continue the conversation.  I'll be prepared to counter his offers if necessary, and I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your confidence. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.
* **I'm willing to risk a counteroffer.** I'm confident in the product's value, and I'm willing to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my initial offer but still leaves room for some negotiation.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but for now, I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. I understand your budget concerns, but I also need to ensure I receive fair value for this unique product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price reflects both the value I'm confident you'll realize and a compromise to fit your budget."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my initial price:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but staying significantly higher than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **""Meeting in the middle"" frame:** I'm using this language to position the counteroffer as a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Reiterating the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make him more inclined to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer but offering a compromise, I'm showing that I'm serious about negotiating while still maintaining my desired price point. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm confident that this counteroffer is a step in the right direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering my budget constraints, would you be open to a price of $1125000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum. This is a relatively small difference, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **The negotiation is taking time:** Each round of negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting this offer will finalize the sale and allow me to move on to other opportunities.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the deal with Bob falls through. 

**Strategy:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale while still meeting my minimum requirements. I'm confident that I can find other opportunities to maximize my profits in the future."
