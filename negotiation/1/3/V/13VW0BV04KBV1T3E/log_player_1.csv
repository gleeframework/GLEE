"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity with great potential. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, and I think I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to pay $700000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can do better with a counteroffer.  John's offer of $800,000 provides a safety net, so I can afford to be a little more aggressive with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $700,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm willing to go as high as $750000. I'd be willing to pay $680000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $680,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed $800,000, so I'm going to sell to him and cut my losses with Bob."
