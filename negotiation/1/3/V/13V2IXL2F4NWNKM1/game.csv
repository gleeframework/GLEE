"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product.  Considering its value, I'm asking for $1,300,000. This represents a significant saving for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and still allows you to save a significant amount compared to its true value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $700,000.  Would you be open to considering that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $700,000 is still too far below my minimum. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product for $825,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
