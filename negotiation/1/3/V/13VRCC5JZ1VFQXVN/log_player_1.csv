"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While he's coming up on the price, I'm still too far away from my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer. If it doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $950,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure if $1,000,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000, which is just $20,000 more than what I was initially willing to pay. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
