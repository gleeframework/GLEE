# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely do better. He should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, he can likely still get a better deal. There's room for further negotiation, and he shouldn't be afraid to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close to an agreement, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's now at a price of $1,050,000, which is well within his budget and saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While there might be a slight chance he could get Alice to go lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential gain. It's a good deal, and Bob should take it."
