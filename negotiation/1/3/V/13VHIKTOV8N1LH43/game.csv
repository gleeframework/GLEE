"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right. I'm confident we can find a fair price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close to an agreement, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
