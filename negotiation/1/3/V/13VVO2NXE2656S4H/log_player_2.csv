"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still above his ideal price point.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his ideal price point of $8,000.  He's also acknowledging Alice's offer and showing that he's willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $10,250 is still above his ideal price point.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's likely Alice will be willing to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Let's try $9,750. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now getting closer to his ideal price point, but he still wants to try to save a little more. He's also using a bit of a psychological tactic by stating this is his ""final offer."" This is a way to signal to Alice that he's serious about this price and isn't willing to go any higher.  However, he's still leaving a little wiggle room in case Alice needs to counter again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand you have a limit, and I want to make this work.  My final offer is $10,000.  This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  He's able to get the product for $10,000, which is significantly lower than his maximum budget of $12,000 and also closer to his ideal price of $8,000.  While he might be able to negotiate a bit lower, it's likely Alice is firm on this offer.  There's a risk of Alice walking away from the deal, or Bob having to pay the $12,000 to John.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible option at this point."
