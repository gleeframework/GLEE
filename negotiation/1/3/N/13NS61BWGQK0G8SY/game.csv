"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still think the product is worth more than $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $88.  It's closer to my budget and still a fair price for the product.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to save a bit more, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go below $95. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. How about we meet at $94? It's a small compromise, but it's still a great deal for both of us.",94.0,Alice,5,
