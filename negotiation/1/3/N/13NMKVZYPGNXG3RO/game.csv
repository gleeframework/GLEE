"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,120.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $80, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",100.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $105. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",105.0,Alice,5,,
