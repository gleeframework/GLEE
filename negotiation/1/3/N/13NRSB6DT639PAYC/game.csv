"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, I can only go up to $8,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal work.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still committed to a fair price for the product's value. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This reflects the benefits you'll gain and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,5,
