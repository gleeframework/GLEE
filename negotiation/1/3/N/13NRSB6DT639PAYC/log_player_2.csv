```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is offering $10,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price, even if it means risking the deal. You have more rounds and can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still committed to a fair price for the product's value. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This reflects the benefits you'll gain and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John.  While Alice is coming down in price, her offer of $9,500 is still more than you are willing to pay. You have a guaranteed alternative with John, and you've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's better to secure the product at your preferred price point."
