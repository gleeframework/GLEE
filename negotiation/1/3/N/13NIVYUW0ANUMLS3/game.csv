"Hi Alice, $250 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $200? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $200 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle for $175? I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $185? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll really like the product.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $185 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $170.  This is my final offer, as I can always just purchase from John for $150.",170.0,Bob,6,
