Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, bringing you closer to your maximum profit.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the ""deal"" and ""value,"" aiming to entice Bob even though the price is slightly above his perceived worth.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum."
