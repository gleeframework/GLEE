Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. I need to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

While Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my ideal $10,000."

Round 4

# Alice's message: I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000 yet. My next offer is $16,000 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,000, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. My next offer is $15,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget of $10,000.  We've had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that works for me. To avoid further delays and stay within my budget, I'll buy the product from John for $10,000.  This guarantees I get the product and it's the best option available at this time."
