"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000 yet. My next offer is $16,000 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This would allow you a fair profit, and it's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,000, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. My next offer is $15,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",15500.0,Alice,7,
