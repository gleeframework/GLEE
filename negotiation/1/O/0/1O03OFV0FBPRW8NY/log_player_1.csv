{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly approach can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Strategic price:**  $175 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Value of the product:**  The product is worth more to me than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him at $150.
* **My minimum:** $150 is my absolute minimum, and I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 floor. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him dropping out entirely or driving the price down even further.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates further negotiation.

I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale at a reasonable price over the potential for a slightly higher profit from a lengthy negotiation."
