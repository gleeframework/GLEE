"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm sure this product is great, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay closer to the original price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. I think it's a fair price that balances both our interests.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal work.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
