"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be happy to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to you. Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
