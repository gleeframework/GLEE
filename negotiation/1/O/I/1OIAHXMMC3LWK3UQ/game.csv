"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you the product for $13,000. This still leaves you a profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
