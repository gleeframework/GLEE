"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm willing to let it go for $200. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it right now.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $150.  That's my final offer.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $165. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",165.0,Alice,5,
