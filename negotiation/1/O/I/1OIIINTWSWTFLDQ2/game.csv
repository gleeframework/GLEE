"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still reflects the significant value of this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $900000 is still not a price I can accept. Given the unique benefits this product offers, I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
