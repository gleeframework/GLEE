Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I know the product is worth. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
