I'm offering Bob the product for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point, allowing room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value for the product.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product, and I believe he will be willing to negotiate a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000.  This is still a good price for both of us, as it's above my minimum value and below his initial offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's slightly above my minimum value and well within my desired range.  I'm happy to accept this offer and finalize the deal with Bob."
