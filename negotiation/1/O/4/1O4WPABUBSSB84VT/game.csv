"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product. Given its features and benefits, I think a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be reasonable too.  $7,000 is too low.  How about $14,000, my final offer. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a significant discount.",14000.0,Alice,5,
