"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,750. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired $9,000 price point by continuing to negotiate.  I'd rather risk a few more rounds than settle for a price that leaves too much profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise one more time - I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 again, but I'm getting close to my limit. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob keeps coming back to the same price, even though I've shown a willingness to compromise. This suggests that he might be stalling or simply not willing to pay more.  I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that is too low."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm happy to make one final concession.  If you're truly at your limit, I'm willing to accept $8,800 for the product. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 8800}
