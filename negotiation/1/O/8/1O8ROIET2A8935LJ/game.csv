"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $9,500.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,750. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise one more time - I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 again, but I'm getting close to my limit. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm happy to make one final concession.  If you're truly at your limit, I'm willing to accept $8,800 for the product. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",8800.0,Alice,7,
