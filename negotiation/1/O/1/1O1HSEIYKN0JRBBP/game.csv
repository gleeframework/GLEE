"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $160? That's still a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's my absolute minimum, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
