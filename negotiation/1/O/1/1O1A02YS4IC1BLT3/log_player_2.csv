{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save money and the maximum you are willing to spend is $10,000, you should reject Alice's offer of $15,000. You can try to negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a common negotiation tactic to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see if she is open to coming down from her initial price. I'm also considering that John is selling the product for $10,000, so my counteroffer is significantly lower than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It is better to continue to negotiate with Alice, as there is still a chance she might come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below John's price of $10,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While I could continue to negotiate, there is no guarantee that Alice will come down further. It's safer to purchase the product from John for $10,000, ensuring I get the product within my budget."
