"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial baseline and allows for some room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It's important to remember that I need to make at least $800,000 to be happy, but I'm also aiming for the highest possible profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for more. I believe I can push for a higher price given the value of the product to me. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $975,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $960,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal that meets my minimum requirements. We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and it's important to consider the risk of further haggling.  There's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer, and I could end up with a lower price or even lose the deal altogether.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a safety net, but it's not the optimal outcome.  $960,000 is a good compromise that ensures a profitable sale."
