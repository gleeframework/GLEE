"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,14000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,,
