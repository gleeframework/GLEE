"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
