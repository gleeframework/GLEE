"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my target price, hoping Bob will be willing to pay it. This is a high offer, but it's worth a shot to see if I can close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than what Bob initially offered, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not yet willing to sell to John, so I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a good middle ground between my ideal price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, Bob will find this counteroffer acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $950,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. Hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob. The negotiations are getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and move on."
