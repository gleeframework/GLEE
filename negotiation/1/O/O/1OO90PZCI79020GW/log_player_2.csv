``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $7,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum of $8,000. There's no reason to accept at this point, as you can still try to negotiate further or buy from John."
