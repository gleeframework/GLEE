"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $110 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Could you do $90? That would be a great deal for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110. How about we try $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
