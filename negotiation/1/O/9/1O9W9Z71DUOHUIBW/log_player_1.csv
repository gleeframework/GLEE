Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price around $1,200,000 leaves a good margin for you while still being significantly less than Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no way of contacting Bob again if he rejects the offer.  If you *can* renegotiate, you might start with a higher offer."
