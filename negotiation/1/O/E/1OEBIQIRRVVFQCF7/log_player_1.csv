Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high. While I see the value in the product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable deal.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is still a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with less from John."
