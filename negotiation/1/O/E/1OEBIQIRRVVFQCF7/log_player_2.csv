"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. I'm asking for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,200,000. This is a significant difference, and there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.** By rejecting, you can initiate a negotiation process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high. While I see the value in the product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,100,000.  This is still a significant difference, and there's room for negotiation.  
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, she is still not meeting you halfway.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue the back-and-forth and try to get a price closer to your ideal range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
