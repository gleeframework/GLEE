"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. I'm asking for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high. While I see the value in the product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's finalize this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
