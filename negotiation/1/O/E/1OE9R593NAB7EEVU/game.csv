"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in your product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product for $13,250.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know if you're interested!",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000.  This is the absolute most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Bob,4,
