"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $110. Would you be open to meeting in the middle?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $107.50 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we meet at $112.50? That's a reasonable compromise for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $112.50, which would be $110. Would you be willing to accept that price?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate you working with me. $110 is getting very close, but it's still a little below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Would you be willing to go up just a bit more, to $111.50?  This would be a small compromise on both our sides and get us closer to closing this deal.",111.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $111.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $111.50, which would be $110.75. Would you be willing to accept that price?",110.75,Bob,8,
