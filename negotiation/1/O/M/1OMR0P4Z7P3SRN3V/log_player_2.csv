"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within Bob's budget, he can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, especially knowing Bob has an alternative option."
