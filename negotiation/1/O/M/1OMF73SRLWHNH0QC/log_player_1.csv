Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer of $125, but still lower than your initial offer of $140, showing flexibility while trying to maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, but it's the same as what John is offering.  There's no further room for negotiation with Bob, and since selling to John yields the same amount, it's the most efficient decision."
