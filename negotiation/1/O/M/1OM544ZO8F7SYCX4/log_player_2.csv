Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is sticking to a price that's higher than your budget.  You've made several counteroffers, and it seems like the negotiation is going nowhere.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 to save time and potentially avoid further rounds of fruitless negotiation."
