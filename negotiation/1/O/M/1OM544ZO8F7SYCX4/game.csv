"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately it's outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1200000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a way to bring the price down a bit further. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for this product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,7,
