Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $8750.  This is a fair price considering we both want to reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to bridge this gap. I'm willing to lower the price to $8,900, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}
