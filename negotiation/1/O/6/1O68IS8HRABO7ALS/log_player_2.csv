"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount while still securing a high-quality item worth more than its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for potential further savings."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a great value."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet in the middle. I propose an offer of $90 for the product. This allows you to save some money compared to the original price, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
