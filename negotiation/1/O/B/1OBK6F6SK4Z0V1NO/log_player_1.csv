I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a decent deal.  I believe this price is attractive enough to get Bob interested in the product without immediately being rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $10,500.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my last offer and his offer.  I believe it's a reasonable price that still allows me to make a profit while potentially appealing to Bob's desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

Bob is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  While $9,500 is better than his previous offer, I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John. It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
