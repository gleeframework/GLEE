"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product.  It's a great product, but I need to keep my budget in mind.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This offer represents a significant discount on its value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  I'm confident that this price is fair to both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
