"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. I'm asking for $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget, it's still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000).  
* **Potential for negotiation:**  There's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is your last resort. You want to save as much money as possible."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a decrease from her previous offer, it's still above the product's worth to her and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Room for counteroffer:** A counteroffer of $1,050,000 or $1,100,000 might be acceptable to Alice and get you a better price than her current offer.
* **Avoiding John:** You still have more negotiation power and can save more money by continuing to bargain with Alice before resorting to John."
