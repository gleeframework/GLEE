"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This price is fair and allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
