"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.  You can likely get the price down from $1,500,000.  You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so you have a good bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering I can buy the product for $1,200,000 from John. I'm hoping to strike a deal somewhere in between these two prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has now offered the same price that John is offering. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations as there's no chance of getting a better deal. Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
