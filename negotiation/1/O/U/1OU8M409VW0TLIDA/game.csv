"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer in this range.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a little too high for me to make it work. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, Bob. I can meet you at $1,025,000, which is $25,000 less than my previous offer. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I've been willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $990,000. I can meet you at $1,015,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where I should consider other buyers.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
