"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

This is a good deal! You're getting the product for $5 less than your maximum budget and for $5 less than what John is offering.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to get a lower price from Alice."
