"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? That way we both get a good deal.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,900. I'm hoping we can get even closer to a deal.",11900.0,Bob,4,
