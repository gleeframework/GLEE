"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for revising your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the adjustment, $1,700,000 is still beyond my current budget. I am willing to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this might be a more suitable figure for us to discuss.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
