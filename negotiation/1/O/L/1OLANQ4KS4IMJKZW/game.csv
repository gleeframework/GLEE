,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, as it's the maximum I can afford.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping you'd be willing to meet me in the middle. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to compromise at $11,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, and offer $9,750 for the product. I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not quite ready to accept $9,750. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,500 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering how close we are to reaching an agreement. Let's try to make this work.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your offer of $9,250, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
