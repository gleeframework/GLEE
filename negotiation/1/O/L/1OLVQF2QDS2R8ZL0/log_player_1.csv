"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Could you do $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $13,500. Can we meet at $14,000 is too high, but $13,500 feels more reasonable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000? This product is really worth it, and I think that's more than fair."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $15,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle of that and $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $13,000 offer. Accepting a lower offer now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away later."
