"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum, but also leaving room for Alice to negotiate.  Offering $120 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still potentially profitable for her. This counteroffer creates a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject future counteroffers and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a good price than risk losing it and paying more."
