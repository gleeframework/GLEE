"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, given my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $850,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer of $850,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $875,000 for the product. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to push myself to $825,000. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product.  Is this a number we can work with?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to push the boundaries, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $850,000 for the product. I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at the $850,000 mark, given our previous discussions. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $850,000, which would be $837,500. Can you consider this compromise?",837500.0,Alice,7,
