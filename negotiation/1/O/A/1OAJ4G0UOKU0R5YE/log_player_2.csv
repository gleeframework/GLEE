{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $152 is getting very close to Bob's limit, he's still determined to try and get a slightly better price.  With only 3 rounds left, he has time for one more counteroffer to try and close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push for a lower price.  $140 is still below Alice's offer and only slightly above his desired price.  With only two rounds left, Bob is aiming to get a deal that's both a good price and a quick closure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but with only one round left and Alice's offer at $149,  Bob should choose to buy from John.  While he's only $1 away from potentially getting a lower price from Alice, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is too high.  Buying from John guarantees a price within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of the final round."
