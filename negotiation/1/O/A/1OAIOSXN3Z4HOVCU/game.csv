"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for your product, but I'm still a bit below $975,000. How about we meet in the middle at $957,500? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",957500.0,Bob,4,
