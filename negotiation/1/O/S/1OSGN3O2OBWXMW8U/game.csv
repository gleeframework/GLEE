"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it would be equally beneficial to your company.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a key asset for your business, and I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
