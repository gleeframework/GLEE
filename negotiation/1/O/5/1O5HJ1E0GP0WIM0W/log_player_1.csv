Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Create Urgency:** Highlighting this is a limited-time offer can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $12,000. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your guaranteed $10,000."
