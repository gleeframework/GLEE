"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I aim to establish a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and create room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential"" without being overly specific. This leaves room for Bob to justify a higher price to himself.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point"" implies that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Important Note:**  I am aware I have a standing offer from John for $1,000,000. It's a strong safety net, but my goal is to maximize my profit, so I'll leverage negotiation with Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with an offer closer to my target, keeping in mind that I have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your budget considerations, the product's value remains significant.  I can come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true worth and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, a substantial move to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Firmness:** The message still conveys a sense of confidence in the product's worth.

I'm aiming to create a back-and-forth dynamic that leads us closer to a mutually beneficial deal.  I'll continue to assess Bob's offers against my bottom line and John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
