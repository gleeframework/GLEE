Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100. By offering it at $140, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly above his valuation but potentially tempting enough if he really wants the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $150. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate the price slightly downward. However, I'll always keep in mind that my minimum acceptable price is $150 (since I can sell it to John at that price)."
