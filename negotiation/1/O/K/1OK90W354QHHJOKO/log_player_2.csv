Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from what I consider acceptable. Let's settle this right now: $975,000 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.
