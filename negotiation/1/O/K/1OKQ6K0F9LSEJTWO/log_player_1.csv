Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above his offer of $110.  We've been negotiating for several rounds and he's sticking close to that price point.  Since we have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, it makes more sense to take the sure thing rather than risk Bob walking away and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer later."
