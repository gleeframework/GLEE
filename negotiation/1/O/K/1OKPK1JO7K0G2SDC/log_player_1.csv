Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower price. It's also a price that I feel is fair given the value of the product to me. However, I'm prepared to go down to John's offer of $1,000,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that I believe is still fair, given the value of the product to me. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,100,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the sale."
