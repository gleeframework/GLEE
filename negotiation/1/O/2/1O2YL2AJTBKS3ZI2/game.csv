"Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $10,000?  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
