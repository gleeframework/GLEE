"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is already at $1,100,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a substantial decrease from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Fairness:**  The offer is still above Alice's minimum value of $800,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Open Communication:**  The message emphasizes your understanding of the product's value and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, but I believe $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects a compromise that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your comfort zone.  You're aiming for a price closer to $950,000.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  Alice has already shown flexibility. It's worth trying to push for a lower price.
* **Avoiding John's Price:**  Buying from John is your last resort, and it's still better to try and get a better deal with Alice if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and settle at $987,500? This reflects a significant compromise from both of us and could be a win-win.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  This offer is exactly in the middle of Alice's previous offer and your last counteroffer, showing you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes getting the deal done, hinting that you may be less willing to continue negotiating for too long.
* **Positive Tone:**  The phrase ""win-win"" emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This represents a significant concession on my part while ensuring a fair deal for both sides. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Target:** Alice's offer of $1,010,000 is getting closer to your desired price range and is significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While you'd prefer a lower price, you're not far off from a deal. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If you keep rejecting offers, you risk Alice getting frustrated and losing the deal completely, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 5 rounds left, it's wise to accept a good offer rather than risk running out of time."
