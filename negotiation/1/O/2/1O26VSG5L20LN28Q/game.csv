"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, but I believe $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects a compromise that acknowledges both our positions.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and settle at $987,500? This reflects a significant compromise from both of us and could be a win-win.  Let's get this deal done.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This represents a significant concession on my part while ensuring a fair deal for both sides. What do you say?",1010000.0,Alice,5,
