Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $15,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, knowing that my floor is $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the ""fantastic deal"" and ""extremely valuable"" subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing my true minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've made a profit.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter. 
* **No Agreement:**  If the negotiation stalls, I'll switch to John to ensure a guaranteed sale for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the [Product Name], but I'm only able to pay $12000 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:**  While $12,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not desperate to sell and want to try for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I will send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but lower than my original price. I'll aim for something like $13,000 or $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a great price for this [Product Name], and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and price point to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strong Closing:** The message ends with a call to action, encouraging Bob to respond. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to counter again or switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13500 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  If you were willing to come down to $12500, I'd be happy to purchase the [Product Name] from you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Floor:** $12,500 is only $500 less than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000 + $2,500 profit). 
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation could drag on and risk Bob walking away or me having to settle with John for $10,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though it's a small profit, this sale could potentially open up opportunities for future business with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the Offer:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
