Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This price still gives you a good deal, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 8250}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
