"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.** You want to save as much as possible.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is the worst option at this point.** You haven't explored Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** $130 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still a fair starting point for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and expresses genuine interest in the product. 
* **Motivates Alice to negotiate:** Offering a lower price encourages Alice to consider a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $135 is the lowest I can go right now.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget ($135 vs your $150 max).** While closer, it's not yet a deal you're willing to accept.
* **Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating.** You've shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice might be willing to come down further. 
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.** There's a good chance you can get a better price from Alice by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $132.50?  I'm really keen on this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** It's in the middle of Alice's latest offer ($135) and your previous offer ($130).
* **Reasoning is clear:** The message explains why you're sticking to your price point and highlights your genuine interest in the product. 
* **Focuses on fairness:**  Framing the offer as ""fair for both of us"" can encourage Alice to be more flexible."
