Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Creating Value Perception:** By mentioning other interest, you create a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it's unlikely Bob will accept it outright. This gives you space to negotiate down towards his perceived value, while still staying above your minimum.

It's important to note: This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
