It's a good deal at $950,000, but you can likely get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my initial goal,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my counteroffer of $800,000.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or make a counteroffer that's higher than $925,000.  It's a good price, and accepting secures the product."
