Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $7,500 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

The offer from Bob is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I have other options. I'll see if we can get closer to my preferred price in the next rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 8500}

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet your current offer. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value provided by the product. I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
