Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate but doesn't give away too much.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for you to counteroffer if Bob's counteroffer is too low.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It avoids confusion and sets the tone for a professional negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we split the difference at $9,250?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still believe that $9,000 is a fair price for the product. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,125 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and it seems he's not willing to go higher.  While I'd prefer $10,000, accepting this offer is still a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000 because it allows me to close the deal faster and avoid potential complications or delays."
