{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's valued at over $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price for a product you've indicated is worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is more than my minimum, I believe there is still room for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a great price and me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $10,500?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to go down to $10,750, which is a significant concession from my last offer.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $10,750 is getting close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $10,600. This would be a fair price for both of us and get us closer to closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer.  At this point, we're very close to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  $10,600 is a good price for me, and it's clear Bob isn't going to go any higher."
