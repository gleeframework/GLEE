"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's valued at over $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price for a product you've indicated is worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to her. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a great price and me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, $11,000 is still above my target. I can likely negotiate further to get a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $10,500?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to go down to $10,750, which is a significant concession from my last offer.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I believe I can still negotiate a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $10,750 is getting close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $10,600. This would be a fair price for both of us and get us closer to closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
