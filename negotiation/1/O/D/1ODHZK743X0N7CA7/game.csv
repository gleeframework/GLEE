,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $115. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more for my product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is limited. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
