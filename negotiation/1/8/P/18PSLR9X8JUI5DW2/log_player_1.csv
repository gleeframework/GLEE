Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's worth. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:** You know John will buy the product for $12,000, which acts as your safety net. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Profit:** By aiming for $18,000, you're giving yourself the chance to make a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the $18,000, the initial offer opens the door for a counter-offer. He might be willing to pay more than $12,000, but less than your initial asking price."
