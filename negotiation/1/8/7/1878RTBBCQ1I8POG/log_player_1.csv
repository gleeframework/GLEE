Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $180 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

While Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price, selling to John guarantees that amount without further negotiation. It's always possible Bob might not increase his offer, making further negotiation risky."
