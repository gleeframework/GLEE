"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as much of the potential profit as possible.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant amount above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, but if not, I'm still prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids risking a potential deal with John.  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be pragmatic."
