Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential to justify the high price and encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have time for a potential negotiation with Bob. If you need to sell quickly, a price closer to John's offer might be more strategic."
