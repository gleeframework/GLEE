Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle somewhere above my minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A higher initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob truly is. If he outright rejects it, I haven't lost anything, as I'll sell to John."
