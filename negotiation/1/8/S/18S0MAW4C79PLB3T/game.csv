"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I was thinking we could meet somewhere in the middle of that and $1400000. How about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $1250000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
