"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will be worth more than $15000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to get a good price for my product and allows you to acquire it for less than its true value to you. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,1,
