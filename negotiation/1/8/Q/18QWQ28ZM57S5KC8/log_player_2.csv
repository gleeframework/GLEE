"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer at a lower price, potentially getting a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the value the product offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room for a better price, and I don't want to commit to a price that's too high."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. I'm confident that the product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her minimum price of $1,200,000. While this is slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it seems unlikely I can get the price down to a point I'm comfortable with.  It's better to stop the negotiation and buy from John for $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a price I can't afford."
