"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Would you be open to that?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the value the product offers. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. I'm confident that the product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
