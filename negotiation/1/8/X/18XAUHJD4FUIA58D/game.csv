"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you a chance to acquire this incredible product. Its value speaks for itself, and I know you'll be impressed. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, recognizing its value but reflecting my own financial constraints. This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value of this product is truly exceptional and $2,000,000 is a fair starting point for negotiation. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my eagerness to see this product in your capable hands.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're at a bit of an impasse.  I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal quickly. Let's settle this at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a very fair price given the product's exceptional value.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Given your previous concessions and my eagerness to close this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this purchase.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
