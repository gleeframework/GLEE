,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm looking to save as much as I can. How about $90? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to save as much as you can, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Can you meet me at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to be reasonable, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $95, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $125 for the product. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think I should just buy it from John for $80, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. How about $98? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to give me another chance, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go as low as $98. I'm still thinking that the product is worth more than that. I'll tell you what, I'll meet you at $115, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to sell the product to John for $100",115.0,Alice,9,
