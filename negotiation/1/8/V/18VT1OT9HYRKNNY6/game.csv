"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm confident this product is worth more to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $925,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal truly worthwhile for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $937,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will lead to a successful transaction.  What are your thoughts?",937500.0,Alice,5,
