"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000, especially since Bob has already demonstrated his interest in the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm confident this product is worth more to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a deal closer to $950,000.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss for me, and I believe I can get a better outcome by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $925,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal truly worthwhile for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $937,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will lead to a successful transaction.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 937500}
