"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,000,000 from Alice.  It's worth $800,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm confident this product is worth more to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This gives us both a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $950,000, which is closer to your target price but still a bit high.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $925,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal truly worthwhile for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $937,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will lead to a successful transaction.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $937,500, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $925,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation, as you're likely not going to get a much better price.  Accepting this offer will save you a significant amount compared to buying from John."
