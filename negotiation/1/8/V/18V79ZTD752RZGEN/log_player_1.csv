Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to potentially negotiate up if he's highly interested.
* **Alternative Secured:** The offer to Bob has a degree of risk, but it's a calculated one. If he rejects it, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my desired price."
