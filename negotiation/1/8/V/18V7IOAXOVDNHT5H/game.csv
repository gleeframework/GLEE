"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on this product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to save some money on this purchase. Can we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
