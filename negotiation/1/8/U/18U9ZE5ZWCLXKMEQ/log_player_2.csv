"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to rush into buying from Alice at her initial price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if she's willing to negotiate. You might be able to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to get the best price possible, and $13,500 is more than I'm currently willing to pay.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and see if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer."
