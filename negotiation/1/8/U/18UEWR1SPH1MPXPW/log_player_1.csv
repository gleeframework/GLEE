"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, but I won't go below my minimum of $800,000.  I also have the safety net of selling to John if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too high. It's not worth risking a deal with him when I can still potentially get a better price. I will counter offer in the next round, hoping to settle somewhere between our initial positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that's still significantly higher than my minimum, but closer to his offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still holding firm on a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's getting close to my initial expectation.  I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for less.  $900,000 is a good outcome."
