"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
