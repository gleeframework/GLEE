"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I hoped to spend. Would you be willing to settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
