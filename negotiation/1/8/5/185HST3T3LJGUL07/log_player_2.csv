Alice's offer:

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a price we both agree on."

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying, even if it's her final offer.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. It's a better deal for me, and I don't want to risk negotiating any further and potentially getting stuck with a price that's too high."
