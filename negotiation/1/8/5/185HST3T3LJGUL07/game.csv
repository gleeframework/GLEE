"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraint, Bob. However, I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price of $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
