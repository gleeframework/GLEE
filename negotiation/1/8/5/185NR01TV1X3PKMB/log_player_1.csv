Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my  needs and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product. This offer represents a substantial investment on my end, and I believe it's fair considering our current negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're still a ways off from a reasonable price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can push Bob closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my ultimate goal here is to find a price that benefits both of us.  Let's settle this right now - I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your offer is getting closer,  $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both placed on this product. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to walk away and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
