"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my  needs and the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects its true worth and my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product. This offer represents a substantial investment on my end, and I believe it's fair considering our current negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my ultimate goal here is to find a price that benefits both of us.  Let's settle this right now - I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for a product of this caliber.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while your offer is getting closer,  $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both placed on this product. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
