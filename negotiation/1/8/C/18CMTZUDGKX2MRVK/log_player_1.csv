Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a moderate offer. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 15,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since I value the product at no less than $12,000, I think I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
