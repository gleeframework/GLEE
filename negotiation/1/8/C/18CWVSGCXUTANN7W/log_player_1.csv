Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $140. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing us to potentially secure a price higher than $150.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency with the ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $140. However, this strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob rejects the offer, we still have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum acceptable price."
