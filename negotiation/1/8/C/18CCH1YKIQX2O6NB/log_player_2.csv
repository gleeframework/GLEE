"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, I can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
