"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is my final offer for now.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on your price, Alice, and I respect that. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be open to $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $12,200, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer.",12200.0,Alice,5,
