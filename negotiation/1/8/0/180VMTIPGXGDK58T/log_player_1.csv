Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. How about we aim for $900,000? I think this would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
