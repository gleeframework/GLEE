Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is my final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500, and it's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price. Buying from John for $8,000 ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price."
