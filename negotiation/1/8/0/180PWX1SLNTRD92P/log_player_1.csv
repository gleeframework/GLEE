Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still higher than his offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a decent compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and closer to my desired price than my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
