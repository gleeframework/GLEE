"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $11,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",11800.0,Alice,5,
