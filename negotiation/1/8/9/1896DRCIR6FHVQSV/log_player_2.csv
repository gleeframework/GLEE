"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's always good to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $150, there's no harm in seeing if Alice will go lower.  This also gives you a chance to assess how motivated Alice is to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower price allows you to see if Alice is flexible. A $30 reduction is a significant chunk, but it's still within the range you're willing to pay. This counteroffer sets the stage for negotiation and allows you to potentially save a good amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're still willing to pay up to $150, so rejecting and counteroffering keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already established a range of $120-$140. This counteroffer splits the difference, showing Alice that you're serious about negotiating and aiming for a fair price. It also increases the pressure on Alice to make a decision â€“ if she rejects this offer, she risks potentially losing the deal."
