Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,000? I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to my desired price point. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
