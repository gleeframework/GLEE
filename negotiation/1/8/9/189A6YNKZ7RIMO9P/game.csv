"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,000? I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
