"Alice, $1500000 is far too high for me. While I see the potential in this product, I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to facilitate a deal. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, I'm still confident in the product's potential and believe it's worth more than $800000. To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value and allows us to both walk away with a successful outcome.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $800000. It's a fair price for the product's potential, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
