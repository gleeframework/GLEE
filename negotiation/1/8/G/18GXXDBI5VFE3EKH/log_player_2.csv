"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate down towards our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I understand the value of the product, but I think that price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to offer $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer to see how Alice responds. This anchoring strategy might give us a better understanding of her bottom line and leave us room to negotiate upwards throughout the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down significantly, her ""lowest price"" is still above our maximum budget. We'll reject and counter, aiming to slowly close the gap without going over $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $700,000?  That's a substantial offer."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're moving closer to our limit and also to a potential compromise with Alice. This offer represents a significant increase from our initial offer but keeps us well below her stated ""lowest price.""  It will be interesting to see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has lowered her price, but she's still holding firm above our $800,000 maximum. It's unlikely she'll budge further, especially since she's stated this is her lowest price twice. We can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
