"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I understand the value of the product, but I think that price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $700,000?  That's a substantial offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
