Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $110, and it's not worth the risk of her going higher in future counteroffers. Buying from John guarantees you stay within budget."
