{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, $150. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to engage.  This approach gives me a good starting point and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to maintain a profit margin.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a little low for me, but I'm flexible. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to sell it to you at that price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price than I'd like."
