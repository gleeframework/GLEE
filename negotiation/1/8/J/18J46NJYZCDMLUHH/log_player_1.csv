Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd sell it to John for, hoping to leverage Bob's potential interest.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm dropping the price to $135, which is still above my minimum, but more appealing to Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while maintaining a fair price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to further negotiate with Bob and risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee my minimum profit."
