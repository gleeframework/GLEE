"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12,500 to make this work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,200. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",12200.0,Bob,4,
