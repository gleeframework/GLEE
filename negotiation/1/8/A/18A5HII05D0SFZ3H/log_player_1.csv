"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's value, but not too high that it seems unreasonable or will immediately lead to rejection. It also leaves room for negotiation, and sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer and my floor price of $800,000. Accepting it would mean losing money on the deal.  While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $750,000 is below my floor price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? This price reflects the product's value and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
