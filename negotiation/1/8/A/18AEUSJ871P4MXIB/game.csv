"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the value I've placed on this product and its potential for your company. I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $1,050,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my company's needs. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
