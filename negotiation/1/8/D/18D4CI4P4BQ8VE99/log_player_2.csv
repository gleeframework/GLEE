"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than buying from John. 
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice's asking price.** Even at $1,200,000, Bob is still getting a good deal since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him."
