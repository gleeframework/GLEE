"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more than that.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of $1,025,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to getting a deal done, and I appreciate that. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're making a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of $1,030,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
