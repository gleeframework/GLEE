"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is still above his target. There's room for negotiation to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate, while still being a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still above Bob's target price of $10,000 but below his maximum price of $12,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it allows him to purchase the product for less than what he would have paid John. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk that Alice could reject further offers or that the negotiation could drag on. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid potential delays or complications."
