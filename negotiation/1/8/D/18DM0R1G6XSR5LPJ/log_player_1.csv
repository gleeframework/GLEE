Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** I know I have a guaranteed sale of $15,000 from John, so I shouldn't accept anything less than that.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) gives room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Creating a sense of urgency and value:** By mentioning a ""public listing"" and an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm trying to make the offer seem more appealing and time-sensitive.

While this initial price is high, it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than my minimum."
