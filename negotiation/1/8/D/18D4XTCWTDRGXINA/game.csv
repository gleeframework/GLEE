"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $700,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of what's being offered, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $850,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $825,000. That's a much smaller difference, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
