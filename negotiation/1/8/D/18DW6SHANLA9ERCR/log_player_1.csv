"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not desperate for a sale and have a guaranteed $150 offer from John. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $130, which would be $115. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, especially since we're nearing the middle ground.  I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $115 is still too low. Let's split the difference again and go with $122.50. This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $122.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $117, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though I have John as a backup buyer for $150, I'm still pushing to get a better price from Bob. While $117 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle yet. The negotiations are getting closer, and I believe I can get a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go down to $120.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $117 and $120, which would be $118.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of rounds, and Bob is only willing to increase his offer by small increments.  I've already come down significantly from my initial asking price.  At this point, it's better to sell to John for $150.  It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident that I'll receive a better price from him than from Bob."
