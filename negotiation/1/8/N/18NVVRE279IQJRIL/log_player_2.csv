"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better, we're still a good bit away from her $10,000 valuation and pushing it a little closer could save more. There's room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11750
}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still representing a significant saving from her previous offer and staying below John's backup offer."
