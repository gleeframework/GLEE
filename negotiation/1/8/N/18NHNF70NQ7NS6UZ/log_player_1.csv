Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than $8,000 from John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great price for you, and it gets me closer to my target. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, $10,500 is a good compromise and a fair deal. It's also significantly better than the $8,000 I'd get from John.  Let's close this deal!"
