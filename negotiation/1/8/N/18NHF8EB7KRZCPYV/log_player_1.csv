Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Time Value & Alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's an incentive to try and secure the higher price from Bob quickly."
