"I appreciate you starting the negotiation, Alice.  However, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit over budget at $900,000.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference again, and I'll offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, so I'll offer the product to you for $925,000, as I mentioned earlier. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,7,
