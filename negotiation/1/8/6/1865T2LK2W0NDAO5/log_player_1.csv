Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $180. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal."", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and might even lead to a better outcome than you expected.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $180, I am leaving space to go down while still staying above my minimum of $150.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product and how aggressively he might negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John is a last resort if I can't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation towards a close.
* **Above Minimum:**  The $160 price point is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** By decreasing the price, I'm testing Bob's willingness to negotiate upwards.  His response will guide my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very insistent on staying below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher than $145.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, it makes more financial sense to sell it to him at this point rather than potentially wasting more time negotiating with Bob."
