Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be stuck on a price point significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  She went up from $90 to $95, which indicates she might not be willing to budge much lower.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, as I have a guaranteed offer of $80 from John."
