Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he has a guaranteed alternative with John.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Alice, given that the product is worth $12,000 to her.  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product, but also aware of its value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Since John is offering the product for $10,000, which is Bob's maximum, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
