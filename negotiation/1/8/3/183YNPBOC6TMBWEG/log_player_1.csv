"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents a fair price for its value, I could come down to $160.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a reasonable offer."", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $80? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go above his maximum perceived value of $80. It makes more financial sense to cut negotiations and sell the product to John for $150, ensuring a profit."
