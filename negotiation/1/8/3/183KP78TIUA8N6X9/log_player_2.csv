# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1400000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1200000. I think you'll really benefit from owning this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the product's worth to Bob, it's still more expensive than buying it from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
