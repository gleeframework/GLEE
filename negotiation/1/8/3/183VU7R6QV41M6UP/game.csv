"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to work with you, $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  This allows me to make a fair profit, and you get a great deal on a product that's worth more to you than that.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not comfortable going below $9000.  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
