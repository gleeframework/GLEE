Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but also leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, showing flexibility.  I believe $1,600,000 is still a fair price,  given the value of the product to both of us. It's also a price that's closer to Bob's offer, which may increase the likelihood of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go any lower. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to him."
