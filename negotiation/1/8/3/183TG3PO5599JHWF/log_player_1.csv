Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce the price to $875,000.  This is a fair offer considering the substantial benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $875,000 is still a bit much; how about we meet in the middle again at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

 We are getting close, but Bob's offer is still below John's offer and significantly below Bob's perceived value. We need to nudge him closer to our acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working to find a agreeable price.  I'm getting closer to my limit on this, but would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob has now met John's offer, and it's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate him up significantly from here. Accepting this offer ensures we get a good price without risking the deal falling through."
