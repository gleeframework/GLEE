"I'm interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a compromise that works.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not sure that's a good fit for my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $925,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a fair price that's close to your offer, and it gives you a significant discount from my original asking price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $930,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's the best I can do.",930000.0,Bob,6,
