Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,190,000. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer stands as a testament to my belief in a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. 
    * It gives Bob a substantial discount compared to its value to you.
    * It leaves you with a significant profit margin, even if slightly less than selling to John. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, emphasizes value, and frames the offer as mutually beneficial. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still having a safety net with John."
