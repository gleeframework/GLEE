"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he could pay John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still higher than what Bob could get from John.  Since Bob's primary goal is to save money, it makes the most sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
