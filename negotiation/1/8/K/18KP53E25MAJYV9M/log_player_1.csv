Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
