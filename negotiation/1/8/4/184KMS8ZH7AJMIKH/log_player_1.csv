Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value Bob will receive. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $10,000? This would allow me to purchase it without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay $10,000, which is more than he initially valued the product, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for counteroffers:**  I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price. I can try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing John is ready to buy at $15,000 provides me with a backup option and confidence to continue negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $11,500? It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers good value for you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to Bob's value:** I'm going slightly above Bob's offer but still keeping the price below my minimum threshold. This signals my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that my offer is a compromise on my end to show good faith.
* **Positive and open tone:**  I maintain a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Focus on value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that $11,500 is still a good value for him, even if it's above his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both our financial positions. I hope this suggestion will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Avoiding further negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely and I'm not certain I could get a better price.
* **John's offer as backup:**  John's offer of $15,000 gives me the security of knowing I have a reliable alternative if this deal falls through.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this moment, considering the potential for further negotiation delays and the risk of losing both Bob and John."
