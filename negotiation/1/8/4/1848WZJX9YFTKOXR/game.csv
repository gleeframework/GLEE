"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Would you be open to that?",77.5,Bob,4,
