"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This would still leave you a healthy profit and allow us to make a deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1050000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1100000. This would still leave you a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This is a fair middle ground that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle again at $1087500? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
