"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
