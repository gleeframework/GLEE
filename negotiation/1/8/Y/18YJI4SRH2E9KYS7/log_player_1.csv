"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a higher price than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's still a bit lower than I'd prefer, it's getting closer to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  We've already gone through several rounds and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob."
