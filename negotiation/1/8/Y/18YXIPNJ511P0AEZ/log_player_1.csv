Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob to maximize your profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $150 offers a 50% profit if Bob accepts. This is a significant markup, but not so high that it would immediately deter Bob if he's genuinely interested in the product.
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle above your minimum price of $100."
