Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently decreasing his offer and is now getting very close to John's standing offer. While we could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly unlikely Bob will reach a price significantly higher than $1,075,000.  

It's time to cut our losses.  Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, avoids further negotiation risks, and allows us to move forward with the sale."
