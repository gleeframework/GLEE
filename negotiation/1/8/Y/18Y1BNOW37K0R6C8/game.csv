"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000. To find a fair starting point, I propose a price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is still a significant amount, but it's within my budget and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I value your interest in this product and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
