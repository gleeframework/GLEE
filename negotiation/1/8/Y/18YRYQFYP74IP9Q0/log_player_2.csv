Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This offer allows us to move forward while ensuring that both parties benefit from the transaction.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $875,000, the deal is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance for a lower price, the potential gains from further negotiation are small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
