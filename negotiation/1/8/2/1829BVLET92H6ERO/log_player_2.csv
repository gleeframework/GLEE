"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $130 is still a bit high, and you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a really great product, and I think you'll be happy with it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$120 is a good price, and it's still within your budget.  It's worth buying from Alice instead of risking a further counteroffer that she might reject, or paying more to John."
