You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's offer right away. You can definitely do better.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, and it's my final offer. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal considering you can get it from John for $1,000,000. It's better to accept the offer and save time and effort in further negotiation."
