Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  This is still a good price for you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm already paying above my initial budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.
