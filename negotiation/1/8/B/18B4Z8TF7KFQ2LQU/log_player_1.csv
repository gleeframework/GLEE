"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's still less than I would like, but I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for $12,000.  I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
