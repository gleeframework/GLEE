"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a much better deal from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price or buy from John."

This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. While it might be too low, it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $18,000 is closer to your budget, it's still better to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your target price."

This is a compromise offer. It's higher than your initial offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. It shows that you're willing to negotiate but still want a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is a good price, it's still a bit higher than what John is offering. It makes sense to try one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

``` 
This is a final counteroffer very close to John's price. It shows a strong commitment to getting a good deal and leaves very little room for further negotiation."
