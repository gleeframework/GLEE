"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from it. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you'll get from selling it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget. You have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, which is the best price available to you at this point. Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of her rejecting your offer again or lowering the price even more, potentially making John's deal less attractive.  It's best to secure the product with John and avoid further risk."
