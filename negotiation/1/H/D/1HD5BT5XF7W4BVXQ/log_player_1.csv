Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price slightly above $15,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. We don't want to go too low with Bob and risk losing potential profit."
