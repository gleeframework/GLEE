"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
