"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, exceeding $1200000 to me. I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects the product's intrinsic worth, while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1200000.  Let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
