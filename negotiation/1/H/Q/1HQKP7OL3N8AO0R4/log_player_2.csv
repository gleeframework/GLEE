Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I am proposing $110 for the product. This allows some flexibility while still respecting the value the product holds for both of us.

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as I can always buy from John for $100 if negotiations fall through."
