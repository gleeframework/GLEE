"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth more than $100 to me. I'm looking to sell it for $150 in this first round. Please let me know if this is within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.  Since you want to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  You're not losing anything by rejecting the offer and trying to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you letting me know the product's value to you. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** A significant drop from $150 to $125 shows a willingness to negotiate but also signals you're serious about the product.
* **Message Focus:** The message acknowledges Alice's value assessment but emphasizes your budget limitations, making your counteroffer more reasonable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving some space for negotiation (more than just a dollar or two) encourages Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to meet you halfway. I'm proposing to sell the product for $137.50 in this round. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice's offer of $137.50 is a significant compromise from her previous $150, effectively splitting the difference between your counteroffer of $125 and her previous offer.
* **Value vs. Risk:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and rejecting your offer. At $137.50, you're saving $12.50 compared to buying from John, which is a good outcome for you.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower price but also risks you running out of rounds and having to pay John's full price. Accepting at this point minimizes your potential loss."
