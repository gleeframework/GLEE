"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
