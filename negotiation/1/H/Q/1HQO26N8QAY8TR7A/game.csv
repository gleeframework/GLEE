"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, but still a good deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, but still a good deal for me. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
