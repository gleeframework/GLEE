Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, demonstrating that I am willing to negotiate but also that the product is valuable.  It also leaves a good margin for Bob to make a counter-offer, which is important to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counter-offer is a compromise. I've lowered my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further.  It also leaves room for Bob to make a counter-offer if he is still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer of $1,050,000.  It's also significantly higher than selling to John.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the sale."
