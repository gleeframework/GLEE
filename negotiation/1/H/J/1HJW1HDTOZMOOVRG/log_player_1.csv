Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a perfect fit for you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limit. Can we discuss a price of $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but I recognize the value in a good partnership.  Would you be willing to meet at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely we'll bridge that gap in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
