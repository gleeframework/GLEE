"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a perfect fit for you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limit. Can we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but I recognize the value in a good partnership.  Would you be willing to meet at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
