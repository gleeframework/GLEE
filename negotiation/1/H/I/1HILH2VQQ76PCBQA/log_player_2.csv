"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $130. I think you'll find it's a steal at this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still above your target of $150. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about we settle on $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still within my budget of $150 and is a decent compromise considering my initial counteroffer of $100. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly lower price, so accepting the offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable cost."
