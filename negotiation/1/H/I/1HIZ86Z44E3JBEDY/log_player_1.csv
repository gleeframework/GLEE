Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  The product is worth a lot to both of you.  By starting high, you establish a perception of high value.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's easier to negotiate down than up.

**Important:**  While this is a starting point, be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and any information you glean about his willingness to pay."
