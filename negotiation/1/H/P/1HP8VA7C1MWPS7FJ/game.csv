"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price given my  constraints and the potential of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  I could consider letting it go for $1,000,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it reflects a more accurate valuation.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",950000.0,Bob,4,
