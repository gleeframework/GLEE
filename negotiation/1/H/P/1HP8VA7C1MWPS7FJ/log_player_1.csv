Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price given my  constraints and the potential of the product.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too large. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
