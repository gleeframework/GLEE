"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price.  How about $120?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling it for $120. 
* **John's Price:** John is selling it for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than what you'd pay John, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $30."
