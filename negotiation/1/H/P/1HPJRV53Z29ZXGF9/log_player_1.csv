{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high but is still within the range of Bob's perceived value. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. Can we shake on it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $125 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and is close to Bob's counteroffer. It's a good compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price."
