{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially since the product is worth up to $15,000 to you. By rejecting the offer, you can explore if Alice is willing to lower the price further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give us a good starting point for negotiation and see if she's willing to come down closer to my target price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my target, I'm still willing to push for a lower price. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I believe there's room for further compromise.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $10,500. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to stay below $11,000. It's a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
