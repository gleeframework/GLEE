"Alice, $22,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this product offers significant value, and this is a fair offer considering its worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",13000.0,Bob,4,
