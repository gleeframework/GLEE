"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a very reasonable price of $22,000. I know it's valuable to you and I'm looking for a quick sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this product offers significant value, and this is a fair offer considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. While it's a reduction from her previous offer, it's not a significant enough decrease to justify accepting. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his budget."
