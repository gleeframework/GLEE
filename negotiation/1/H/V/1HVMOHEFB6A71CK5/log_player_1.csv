"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still potential for a higher price. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $140. This is still a good price for me, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer and he'll be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, I'm now in round 4, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, I might lose Bob as a buyer altogether.  $130 is a good price, and it's worth securing the sale rather than risking getting nothing."
