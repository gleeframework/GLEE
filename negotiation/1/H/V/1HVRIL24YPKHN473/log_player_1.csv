{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have the advantage of knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without going over, ensuring he's likely to accept and maximizing our profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a strong offer like $925,000 leaves room for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  We have a solid backup plan with John at $800,000, so we can afford to be a little bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
