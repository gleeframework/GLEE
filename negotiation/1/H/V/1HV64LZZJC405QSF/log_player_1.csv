Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price that is above your minimum but leaves room for bargaining. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above your minimum price of $80, so accepting his offer is the best option in this scenario. You'll secure a sale quickly and avoid potentially going through more rounds of negotiation."
