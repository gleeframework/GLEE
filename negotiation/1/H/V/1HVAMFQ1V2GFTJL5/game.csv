"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
