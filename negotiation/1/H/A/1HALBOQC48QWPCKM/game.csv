"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. It's a bit above my budget, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost. Can you meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise. How about $1050000? This allows you to secure the product while still remaining within a reasonable price range. I'm open to further discussion, but let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'd like to propose a price of $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $980000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'm proposing $1020000. This reflects a significant discount, but it's the lowest I can go without losing money. Let's make this deal happen.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1020000. I'd like to propose a price of $990000. This is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1005000? It's just a small step up from your offer, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
