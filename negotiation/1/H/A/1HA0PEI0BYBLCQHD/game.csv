"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I think I can do better than that. How about $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",9200.0,Bob,4,
