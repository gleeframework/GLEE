Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This allows for potential negotiation and a higher final sale price. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* This initial offer sets the tone for the negotiation, and I'm open to further discussions depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm aiming for a compromise by lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,500. 
* This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin for myself. 
* The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it clear that he's getting a good deal.
* This counteroffer is a strategic move to test Bob's willingness to pay a bit more while remaining open to further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am comfortable with paying up to $13000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $13,500. This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. I'm confident that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher price. It's better to secure this deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price."
