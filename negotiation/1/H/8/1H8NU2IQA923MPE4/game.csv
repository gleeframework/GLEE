"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it at $22,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your work.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit of $10,000.  Would you consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $16,000 is still beyond my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $11,000, but that's really my absolute limit.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $11,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to make one final concession. If you agree to $13,500, we have a deal. This offer stands until the end of the next round, otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. If you're willing to meet me in the middle at $12,250, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",12250.0,Bob,6,
