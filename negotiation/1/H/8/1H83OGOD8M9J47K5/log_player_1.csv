Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $910,000 is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue pushing Bob, he's consistently moving upwards and we're getting very close to our guaranteed sale price with John. Accepting $910,000 now represents a good balance of risk and reward. It's highly unlikely Bob will suddenly drop his offer drastically, and we're securing a significant profit."
