I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get $100, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to exceed $100 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $100?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. Bob is firm on his price, and I've already made two counteroffers. I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price. John is a guaranteed sale at $100, so it's the best option for me at this point."
