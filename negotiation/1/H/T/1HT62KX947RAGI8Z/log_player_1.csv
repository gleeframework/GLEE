"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to see how much Bob is willing to pay. If he rejects, it gives me a good starting point for negotiation. It's also important to remember that I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, considering my minimum is $1,500,000. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again. I'm not giving up on getting a better price, and I still have some rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still not willing to go lower than my minimum. I'm hoping that with this offer, we can finally reach an agreement and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. While John is a guaranteed sale, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. There's still time to negotiate and I'm not giving up on a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm making one final attempt to get Bob to agree. I'm dropping my price to $1,550,000. This is very close to my minimum, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and finally accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  I've done everything I can to negotiate a better price, but it's clear that he isn't willing to meet my needs.  To ensure I don't lose out completely, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a secure sale and a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer."
