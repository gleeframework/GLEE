# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, potentially exceeding $1000000. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm confident it aligns with your interests. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the potential upside and my desire to establish a mutually beneficial relationship. Consider this a chance to acquire something truly exceptional. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for your maximum budget. You have no information to suggest the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to you.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John gives you the same product at the same price, with no risk."
