"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You will now make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and what I know it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  You're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.
* **It's likely Alice won't budge much further.**  She's already met you halfway.  
* **Negotiating further risks losing the deal and having to buy from John.**

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Alice's offer at $1,025,000 is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price within your budget."
