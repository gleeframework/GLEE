"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand $100 is a good price for you, it's quite a bit lower than what I need to get. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110.  If we can meet somewhere in the middle, I think we can make a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a good price. How about $120?  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $115, but I really can't go any higher.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $115. How about we split the difference and I come down to $117.50? It's just a small step away from my price and a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",117.5,Alice,7,
