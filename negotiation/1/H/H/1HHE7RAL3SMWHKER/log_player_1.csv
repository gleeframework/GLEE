Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand $100 is a good price for you, it's quite a bit lower than what I need to get. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110.  If we can meet somewhere in the middle, I think we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to try to get a bit more out of the negotiation with Bob before I sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a good price. How about $120?  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $115, but I really can't go any higher.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly better price. I'll try to get one more counteroffer from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $115. How about we split the difference and I come down to $117.50? It's just a small step away from my price and a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 117.5}
