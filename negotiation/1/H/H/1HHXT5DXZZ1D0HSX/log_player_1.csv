Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a good price.  I'm also leaving myself room to potentially make a counteroffer if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $110, which is still above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is too low and I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm going to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
