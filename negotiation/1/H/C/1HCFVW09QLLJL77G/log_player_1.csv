I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while still having a safety net."
