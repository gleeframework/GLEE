Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm prepared to counter his offers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good compromise and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
