{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to potentially lower the price if necessary.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, focusing on the product's value for Bob. It also directly states the price upfront.

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting price:**  By starting high, I can potentially get a better deal. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay closer to my asking price.
* **Negotiation room:**  Starting high also provides room for negotiation. I can lower the price in increments during counteroffers. 
* **John as a fallback:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John gives me the confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe I can potentially get a higher price than $15,000. Bob is already showing interest, so there's a good chance I can negotiate a better deal.
* **John as a safety net:** I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell. This can put pressure on Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $15,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for closer to my initial asking price. How about $17,000? This would still represent a significant saving for you compared to my original asking price."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer of $15,000 with $17,000. This is a compromise that moves halfway between our previous positions. 
* **Message:** The message reinforces the value of the product and highlights the potential savings compared to my initial price. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm staying firm on my price but showing flexibility by compromising.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a compromise:**  Meeting halfway shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a better price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Optimizing potential:**  I believe there's a chance Bob might accept $17,000, getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,500 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Considering the possibility of further negotiation, I'm willing to take this deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value proposition:**  $16,500 is a good price, especially since it's only $4,500 less than my initial asking price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation might result in a slightly higher offer from Bob, but there's also a risk that he could walk away completely.
* **Time factor:**  It's unclear if Bob will accept a higher price or if another buyer will emerge. Accepting his offer now is the most sensible decision."
