"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Not Too High:**  While starting high, it's important to be realistic. A price too far from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might discourage him entirely.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make your offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of room for negotiation and time before considering John's offer.  It's strategically better to counter-offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** You clearly indicate that Bob's previous offer was unacceptable while providing a reason.
* **Significant Movement:**  Dropping $100,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to do the same.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The new price of $1,000,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to your desired outcome.  This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a more substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This would be a good middle ground, and we could both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, $900,000 is still significantly below your $1,200,000 minimum. You have room to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Accepting at this stage might signal you're willing to go much lower, diminishing your negotiating position. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to take a firmer stance with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $900,000 is still below what I can accept.  To be frank, I have another offer for the full asking price, but I'd prefer to work with you. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer. "", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** You clearly state this is your final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Introducing John's offer (without revealing the actual amount) adds credibility to your position and emphasizes the opportunity cost for Bob.
* **Compromise but Above Minimum:** Dropping to $975,000 shows a willingness to compromise but keeps you comfortably above your $1,200,000 minimum and allows room for one final concession if needed."
