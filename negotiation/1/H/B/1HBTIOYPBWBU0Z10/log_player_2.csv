"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. This offer is only valid for a limited time, as I already have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $10,000 and save money."
