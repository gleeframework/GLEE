"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125 for the product. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love it!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $105 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $120. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
