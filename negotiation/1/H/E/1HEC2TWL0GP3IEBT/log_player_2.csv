Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's a price I can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000, and I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a small potential saving."
