Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($11,999) creates a sense of urgency and a potential ""deal"" for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for potential negotiation towards a higher price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
