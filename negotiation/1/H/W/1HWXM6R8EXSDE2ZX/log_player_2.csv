"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $900,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price below $900,000 and this counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being a significant discount from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Bob has a chance to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a lower price, so he'll reject the offer and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to go up slightly from his previous offer, but still wants to stay below Alice's last offer. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still significantly lower than what Bob would pay from John ($1,200,000). While there's a slight chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting again and ultimately having to buy from John outweighs the potential for a few thousand dollar savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without unnecessary risk."
