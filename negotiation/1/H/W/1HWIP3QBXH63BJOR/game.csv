"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for being flexible. I really appreciate it.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $90, as I think that's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $90, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $95 and $90. How about we try $92.50? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",92.5,Alice,5,
