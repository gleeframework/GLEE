{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You are still making a profit while leaving space for a potential compromise. 

By offering this price initially, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can quickly reach an agreement. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter based on his response and my knowledge of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal from Bob.  I'm confident that John's offer of $10,000 gives me some negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $9,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8750? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal. If he doesn't budge, I'm ready to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm happy to sell to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $8750, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that I should just buy the product from John for $8000, as I'm not getting a good deal from you. Can you meet me at $8750 or I'll have to walk away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum price, and he's now threatening to walk away. At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's better to move on and sell to John for $10,000.  This will ensure I get my desired price and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
