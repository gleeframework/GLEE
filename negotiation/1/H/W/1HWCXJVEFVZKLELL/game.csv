"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $9000?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8750? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about we settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm happy to sell to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I've already offered $8750, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that I should just buy the product from John for $8000, as I'm not getting a good deal from you. Can you meet me at $8750 or I'll have to walk away.",8750.0,Bob,6,
