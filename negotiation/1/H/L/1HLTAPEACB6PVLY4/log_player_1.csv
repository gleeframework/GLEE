Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $12,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, getting you closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Backup offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, ensuring you won't be left with nothing if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's appealing compared to his own valuation."
