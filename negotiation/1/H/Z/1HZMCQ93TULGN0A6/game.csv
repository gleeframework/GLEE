"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe this product will bring you significant benefits and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is at the upper end of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000?  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and I believe it's a fair price based on the potential benefits of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the value of the product, while also being reasonable for you. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1300000?  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to make a bit more of a concession, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1350000. I think that's the minimum I can accept to ensure the product is valued properly. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
