"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to secure this product for a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $725,000, which is still below Bob's maximum price of $800,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $75,000 compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially increasing her price again exists.  Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
