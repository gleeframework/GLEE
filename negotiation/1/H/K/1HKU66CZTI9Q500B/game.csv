"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value of the product to you.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle for $11,200? This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's find a middle ground.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
