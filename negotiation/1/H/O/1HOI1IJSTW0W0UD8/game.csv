"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  Thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18000, which reflects the value and uniqueness of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $12000. It's fair considering the product's value to me and the price I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I have other offers on the table.  Let's make this deal happen.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still too high for me.  I'm only able to go up to $13000.  This is a fair price given the product's value to me and the price I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,6,
