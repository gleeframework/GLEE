"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($20,000) because I have no information about Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging to start the negotiation on a good note.
* **Value Proposition:**  I mention that the product is ""unique"" to pique Bob's interest.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers (or lack thereof) in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he is interested and willing to negotiate. This gives me leverage to counter-offer.
* **Strategic Advantage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still being open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  Thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000, which reflects the value and uniqueness of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  I'm justifying the price with a value-based argument, highlighting the uniqueness of the product. 
* **Maintaining Control:**  I'm still setting the price, but leaving room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* By offering $18,000, I'm  testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price range.  
* If he rejects, I'll consider a slightly lower offer in the next round, but I'll also factor in the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $12000. It's fair considering the product's value to me and the price I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Stalemate:** We are at a stalemate, with Bob unwilling to budge. 
* **Time is running out:**  With 6 rounds left, I need to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price or explore selling to John.

**Strategy:**

* **One more counteroffer:**  I'll make one more counteroffer in the next round, offering a price closer to $15,000 but still higher than Bob's offer. If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John.
* **Selling to John:**  If Bob remains stubborn, selling to John for $15,000 is a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I have other offers on the table.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer, aiming for my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing my willingness to negotiate but also stating my limits.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other offers"" subtly implies that I could easily sell the product to someone else, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great, we've reached an agreement!
* If Bob rejects:  I'll move to sell to John immediately.  I'm now at the point where the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still too high for me.  I'm only able to go up to $13000.  This is a fair price given the product's value to me and the price I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $13,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds left, the potential of getting a better deal with Bob is shrinking.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob. I've reached a point where my time is more valuable than attempting to squeeze out a few extra thousand dollars. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale."
