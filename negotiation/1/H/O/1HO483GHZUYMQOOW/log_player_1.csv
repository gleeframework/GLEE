"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage in a positive negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $100, I give Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being forced to accept my initial offer. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $80. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm not willing to accept $85, it's a good sign that Bob is interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price and potentially get closer to my target of $120. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little to $95.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still aiming for a price point that is closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob about the product's value could influence him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:** My message leaves room for further negotiation, allowing for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While I'd prefer a higher price, $90 is close to my minimum of $80.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents me from losing out completely.

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $90."
