"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",9500.0,Bob,6,
