"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I can meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, he still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable offering $11,000.  This price allows for a fair profit for you and a good value for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, Bob is still better off rejecting the offer.  He has a few rounds left and can continue to negotiate for a lower price.  If he runs out of rounds, he can always buy from John for $15,000, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,750.  This is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a profit while giving me a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I've already gone lower than I'd like, and I need to make a profit. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and is getting closer to his desired price.  He has only a few rounds left and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  While he could potentially get a lower price with more negotiation, there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving him to buy from John for $15,000.  Accepting the offer at $13,000 is a good compromise, saving Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
