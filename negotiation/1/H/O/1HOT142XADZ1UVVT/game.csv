"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I can meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable offering $11,000.  This price allows for a fair profit for you and a good value for me.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,750.  This is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a profit while giving me a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I've already gone lower than I'd like, and I need to make a profit. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
