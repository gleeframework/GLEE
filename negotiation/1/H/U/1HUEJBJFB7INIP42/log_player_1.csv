Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A price of $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will receive from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Since he's interested, I can likely push for a higher price in my counteroffer. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 allows me to take a calculated risk and continue negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell it for $9,250.  This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stronger Position:** The counter-offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum value of $8,000,  giving me some leverage.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" Bob is getting to encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my absolute minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further concessions is high.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.  Taking John's offer eliminates the risk of Bob refusing to budge any further, leaving me with a lower price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and could potentially result in a lower price or a stalemate. 

By selling to John, I ensure a quick and profitable transaction."
