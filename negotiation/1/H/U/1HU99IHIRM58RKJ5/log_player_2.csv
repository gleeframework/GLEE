This price reflects not only its market value but also the exclusive access and support you'll receive from us. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though Alice is trying to justify the price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob can get the same product from John for a price that fits his budget."
