"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be extremely beneficial to your business.  I'm confident that it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that is fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This price represents a significant discount from its true value, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a compelling opportunity.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
