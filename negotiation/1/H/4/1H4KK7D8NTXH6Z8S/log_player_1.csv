Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can significantly lower the price. If he counters, you know he's interested.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
