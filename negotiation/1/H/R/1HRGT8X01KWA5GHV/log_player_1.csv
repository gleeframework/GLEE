{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids giving away too much value immediately.
* **Setting a clear price:**  Specifying the price clearly avoids any ambiguity and allows Bob to quickly understand the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates that I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away to John. 
* My decision will be based on Bob's counteroffer, my time constraints, and my desire to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below my desired profit. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially securing a better deal.
* **John is always an option:**  Even if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000. This gives me the flexibility to pursue a better deal with Bob without undue pressure.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a deal that is both profitable and reasonable for both of us.
* I will carefully consider Bob's potential response and my willingness to further negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings and it allows us to both reach an agreement. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is $25,000 higher than Bob's offer and $25,000 lower than my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $875,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't sell below my desired profit.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message remains polite and encourages further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, the deal is complete.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John.
* My decision will be based on Bob's counteroffer, my time constraints, and my desire to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $875000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $860000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is still below my desired profit, it's only $40,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation becoming too time-consuming. 
* **John is still a backup:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, providing a safety net if this deal falls through.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures a quick and relatively profitable outcome.
* While John is still a viable option, I believe this deal offers a good compromise and allows me to avoid the potential risks associated with further negotiation."
