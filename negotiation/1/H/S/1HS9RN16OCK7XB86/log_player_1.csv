{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a profit above her minimum ($12,000).
* **Creating Urgency:** By slightly overvaluing the product and presenting it as a potential deal, Alice aims to make Bob think he's getting a discount.  
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's a limit on how low she needs to go with Bob.

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob at a good price and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out by offering it for too little."
