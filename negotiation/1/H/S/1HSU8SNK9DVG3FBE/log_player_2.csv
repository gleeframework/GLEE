Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $70, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $90. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go below $90, and it's better to secure the product at the known $80 price from John."
