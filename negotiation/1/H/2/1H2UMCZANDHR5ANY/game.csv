"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,225,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite let it go for that price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,237,500?  This would be a fair deal considering the product's value.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
