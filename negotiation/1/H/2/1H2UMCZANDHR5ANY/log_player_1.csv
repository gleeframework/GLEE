Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. Let's see if we can push a little further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly very interested and has steadily increased his offer.  While we could try to push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $1,230,000 guarantees a great price and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
