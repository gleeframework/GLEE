"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. You should definitely try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $80 for this product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start with an offer that meets your needs. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer gives Alice room to counter and allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.  
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is clear about your budget limitations while remaining courteous and open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still above your maximum price.  There's room for negotiation, and you can try to meet closer to the middle ground. Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $80 is a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** This counteroffer is at your absolute maximum price. 
* **Finding a Compromise:**  It's unlikely Alice will go as low as $80. By offering $100, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying within your budget.
* **Clear and Firm:** The message clearly states your preferred price and presents it as a fair deal."
