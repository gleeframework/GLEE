"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A positive and friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:** Emphasizing that the deal is good for both of us can make Bob more likely to accept.

This approach aims to initiate a negotiation while keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is better than John's offer of $80, it's still below my desired range.  I believe there's still room for Bob to move higher. 
* **Strategic Delay:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's level of interest and see if he's willing to come up further. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round, I maintain leverage and aim to secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate that the deal is still very favorable for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get for his money.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While $85 is lower than my initial goal, it's still above my minimum of $80 and very close to John's offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  With only 6 rounds remaining,  rejecting Bob's offer risks losing him as a buyer entirely. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing the chance to sell to John for $80. 

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and maximizes my earnings within the constraints of the limited rounds. While not ideal, it's the most pragmatic decision at this point."
