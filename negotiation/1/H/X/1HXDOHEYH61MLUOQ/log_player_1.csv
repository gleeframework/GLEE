"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  It's important to remember that I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get him to go higher.  I'm still not at the point where I'm ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's the best way to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll have to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal altogether is now too high.  I'm happy to secure a sale at my minimum target price."
