"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $18,000.  It's a fair offer considering its worth to both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $14,000 is a fair price. Can we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
