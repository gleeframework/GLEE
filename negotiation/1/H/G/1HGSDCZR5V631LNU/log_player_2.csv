"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.  While I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000, I'm willing to give you a chance to acquire it for less.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John saves you $200,000 and ensures you stay within your budget."
