"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price significantly below my minimum. It's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation for a smaller profit when I have a guaranteed offer from John."
