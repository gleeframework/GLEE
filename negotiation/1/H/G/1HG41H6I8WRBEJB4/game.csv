"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1200000. This reflects the unique value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,4,
