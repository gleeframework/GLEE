"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  There's enough wiggle room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

**Important Note:** I'm not immediately resorting to John's offer. This strategy allows me to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  While John offers a guaranteed $120, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **Time to counter:**  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $95 is a fair price for both of us.
* **Leaving room for further negotiations:**  There's still a small buffer for potential counteroffers.

**Goal:** I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and see if we can reach a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $80, which is fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $80 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to accept that price. 
* **Time is running out:**  While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, time is running out.  I need to consider the risk of getting stuck at a low price if we don't reach an agreement soon. 
* **Weighing my options:**  Selling to John for $120 is a safe option, but I'm still holding out for a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer one more time to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $80, but I need to make a bit more than that.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a significant compromise from my original offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm making my final counteroffer, offering a price that's just above Bob's maximum. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but also maintains my minimum price limit.
* **Time pressure:**  I'm highlighting the time factor to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  I'm reminding Bob that I've made a significant compromise to meet his needs.

**Goal:** This is my last attempt to get a better price from Bob before considering John's offer. I'm hoping that the time pressure and my willingness to compromise will convince Bob to accept."
