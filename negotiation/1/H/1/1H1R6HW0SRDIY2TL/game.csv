"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $100. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is a bit higher than your maximum but still a good compromise. I think you'll really enjoy the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",125.0,Alice,5,
