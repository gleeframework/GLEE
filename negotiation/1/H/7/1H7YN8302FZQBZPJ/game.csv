"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $11000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product to you for $12500. This represents a significant discount from my initial price, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,
