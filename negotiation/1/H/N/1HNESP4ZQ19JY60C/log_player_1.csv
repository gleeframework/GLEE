Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* I believe this price is high enough to incentivize Bob to buy, while still giving me a substantial profit.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on any value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* I don't know Bob's valuation of the product. This makes it a risky proposition, but also a potential opportunity to maximize my profit. 
* I'm assuming that Bob is a rational buyer and will consider the value he places on the product versus the asking price. 
* This is just the initial offer. I may need to adjust the price based on Bob's reaction and any information I gather about his valuation."
