"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1000000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds immense value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, so I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within my budget.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also trying to get a good deal.  I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Considering the potential value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900000. It's a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for me considering my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  I'm going to accept her offer and buy the product."
