"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds immense value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. This is a common tactic in sales.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm not just stating a price, I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob. This creates an incentive for him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and initiate dialogue. 

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1000000 is a good starting point, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not going to settle for the minimum right away, especially since Bob acknowledged my initial offer was a good starting point. I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Considering the potential value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I still value the product highly.
* **Reasoning:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm providing justification for my counteroffer, appealing to the potential value and emphasizing a fair deal. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and allows for further discussion.

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable price while still giving me some leverage."
