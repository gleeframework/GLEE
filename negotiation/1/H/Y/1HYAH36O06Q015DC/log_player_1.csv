{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer, allowing me to potentially earn even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close enough to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000. It's a good deal for both of us."
