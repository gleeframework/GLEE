"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, it's still not the best deal.  Bob should aim to get a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $100 to Alice, so offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This leaves some room for negotiation and allows Bob to potentially get a better deal without risking losing the product to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He has 7 rounds remaining, giving him ample time to secure a better deal.  While the risk of losing the product to John exists, Bob should continue to try to get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price while acknowledging that Alice is unlikely to accept a price significantly lower than her own value.  Increasing the counteroffer to $110 shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. This move keeps the negotiation moving forward and potentially leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still not ideal. He has 5 rounds left, and  Alice's offer is likely to decrease as time progresses. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to $110. The risk of losing the product to John is still present but manageable considering the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, showing flexibility and demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  He is aware that Alice is unlikely to accept his previous offer of $110, but he wants to avoid going too high and losing the potential for a better deal.  $115 is a reasonable increase that keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving room for Alice to potentially lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still too high, and there are only 3 rounds remaining.  Bob should continue to negotiate in an attempt to get a lower price closer to his desired range.  While the risk of losing the product to John increases with fewer rounds, the potential for a better deal is still worth pursuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to be more assertive in his counteroffer.  He's increasing the offer to $120, which is a significant jump from his previous offer of $115.  This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.  It also puts pressure on Alice, as she has limited time to negotiate.  If she rejects this offer, Bob can still buy from John, but the negotiation is getting close to the point where that may be the only option left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to get the product.  Alice's offer of $140 is only $10 less than John's price, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer in the final round.  Bob needs to weigh the risk of losing the product altogether against the potential for a small price difference.  Given the limited time and the fact that Alice has been unwilling to negotiate further, the best course of action is to buy from John."
