"Alice,  $2,000,000 is way out of my range. I'm  very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't part with it for less than $1,800,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I have another buyer willing to pay me $1,500,000.  To make this worthwhile for me, I need to be closer to that number. My final offer is $1,600,000. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still the best option for you. $1,600,000 is pushing my budget, but I'm willing to go to $1,500,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
