Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still the best option for you. $1,600,000 is pushing my budget, but I'm willing to go to $1,500,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John. There's no guarantee of securing a better deal with further negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures you get the desired amount."
