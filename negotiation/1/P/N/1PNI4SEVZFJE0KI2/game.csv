"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,200.
