"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This price still gives you a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
