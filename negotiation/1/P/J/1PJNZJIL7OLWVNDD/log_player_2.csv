"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget ($15,000 vs your $10,000 limit).  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, start with your maximum budget of $10,000. This sets a clear boundary for the negotiation. Alice may reject this, but it's a starting point to see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $13,500 is closer to your limit, it's still above your desired price point. You have several rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again will allow you to continue trying to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're starting to see that Alice is willing to negotiate. Increasing your offer to $11,000 shows that you're serious about buying the product but are still looking for a better deal. This should keep the negotiation moving forward without risking losing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $12,800 is getting closer to your limit, you still have several rounds left.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again will give you more leverage to try to bring the price down even further. It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if you can get even closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing some flexibility, but still wants a higher price than you are comfortable with. Increasing your offer to $11,500 demonstrates your willingness to compromise, but you are still pushing for a better deal.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving in the right direction while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $12,600 is getting close to your limit, you still have 3 rounds to negotiate.  You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate and she's demonstrating some flexibility.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again gives you a chance to try to bridge the gap and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's price is now very close to your maximum budget. Increasing your offer to $12,000 signals your serious intent to buy while also attempting to close the gap. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing a sale with only a few rounds left. If she rejects this offer, you can decide if you want to risk going to round 9 or buying from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  You are only one round away from the final round.  Alice's offer is still slightly above your comfort zone. Although you have demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, you are running out of rounds and Alice is not showing a huge willingness to come down. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $10,000. You've successfully negotiated a much lower price than Alice's initial offer, and while it's not your ideal price, you are still saving money compared to the initial negotiation. This approach ensures you get the product within your budget without risking another rejected counteroffer that could result in losing the product entirely."
