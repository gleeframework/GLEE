"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be able to consider a lower price, perhaps around $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
