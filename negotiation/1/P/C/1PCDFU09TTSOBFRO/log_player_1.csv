Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay and it's still less than my minimum. There's no point in further negotiation. John offers a better deal."
