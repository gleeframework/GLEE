Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I believe I can negotiate a higher price and aim for a final price closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000. There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, as I have already rejected one of his counteroffers. The negotiation process is still ongoing, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,090,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,080,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. Let's seal the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is close to my desired range and represents a good compromise. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance I could get a better offer, but there's also a chance I could end up with a lower price or even lose the deal altogether.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure a good deal and avoid any potential downsides."
