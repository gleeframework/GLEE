,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,090,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to reach an agreeable solution.  Let's try to finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,080,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. Let's seal the deal now.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
