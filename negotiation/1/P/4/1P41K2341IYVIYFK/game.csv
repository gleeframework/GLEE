"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and your desire for a quick sale.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $825,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
