"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a more reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, let's try to find a middle ground here. $1,100,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This seems like a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach.  How about we settle this right now at $950,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a win-win for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Would you consider $850,000?  I think that's a strong offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is my final offer. If it works, we can close this out today.",925000.0,Alice,7,
