"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you. It is a unique opportunity that we believe could significantly enhance your business operations. We are offering it to you for $950,000. This price reflects its exceptional value and the benefits it can bring to your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm beginning with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) than Alice's asking price ($950,000). This establishes a negotiation floor and leaves room to maneuver upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I maintain a polite and professional tone to encourage a positive negotiation environment.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By expressing continued interest and a willingness to negotiate, I signal that a deal is still possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of our product and its potential impact on your business, I am willing to negotiate further. Our revised offer is $750,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved down significantly from $950,000 to $750,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** The current offer is still above our $800,000 walk-away point (buying from John).
* **Continued Negotiation:** By rejecting and countering, we can explore if a more favorable price is achievable within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $700,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer presents a price that is a significant step up from my previous offer, but still below both Alice's current offer and my walk-away point. 
* **Introducing a ""Hard Limit"":** By mentioning a ""hard limit,"" I signal a strong position without being overly aggressive.  This might encourage Alice to make a final concession.
* **Urgency:**  Expressing readiness to ""close the deal today"" adds a time element and suggests that further haggling might not be productive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your prompt response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you for $725,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** $725,000 is below our $800,000 walk-away point.
* **Good Deal:** We've successfully negotiated a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $950,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** While we could try to push further, we're getting close to our limit, and Alice might not go much lower. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation falling apart."
