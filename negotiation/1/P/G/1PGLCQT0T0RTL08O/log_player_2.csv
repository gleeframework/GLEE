"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your desired price range.  Even if Alice doesn't budge, you're safe knowing John will sell it to you for $10,000."
