Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob that it's worth a significant amount, even if you don't explicitly state your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob.  You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's a calculated risk in aiming higher. 
* Depending on the product and your relationship with Bob, you might adjust the initial offer and messaging."
