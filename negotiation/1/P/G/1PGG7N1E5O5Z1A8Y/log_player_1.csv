Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it more likely he'll accept or counteroffer. 
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is straightforward and focuses on the price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $13,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to your minimum:** While $13,000 is better than John's $12,000, you can likely do better with a counteroffer. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can propose a price closer to your initial $14,000, potentially securing a higher profit. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Since Bob offered $13,000, you should consider a counteroffer that's closer to your original $14,000 offer.  You want to strike a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still a little lower than where I'd like to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  A counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise between your initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to find common ground.
* **Emphasizing value:**  The message reiterates the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider your offer.
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  While this offer is closer to Bob's offer, it still leaves room for negotiation if necessary.

This approach aims to keep the negotiations moving while ensuring you don't undervalue your product."
