{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, and I believe it holds even greater value for your business. I'm confident it can significantly enhance your operations. To get things started, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which still provides you with a good profit.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is too low, especially since I know the product is worth more to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings.  It's a significant investment for both of us, so let's aim for a price that's fair and benefits both sides.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for you to gain substantial value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can push for a higher amount, especially considering the product's value to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe is fair.  We both stand to gain significantly from this deal.  Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,160,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $1,160,000 is getting closer to my target. It's not ideal, but I've been negotiating for a while now.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will result in more back and forth without significant gains.  I'd rather secure the deal and move on."
