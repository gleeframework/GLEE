"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
