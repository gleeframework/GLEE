"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant amount considering my own valuation. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering my valuation and the value you've already expressed. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. I hope you can consider my final offer.",875000.0,Bob,6,
