Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially pushing the price a bit higher. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** While $145 is more than Bob wants to pay, it's presented as a ""deal"" to entice him. The message emphasizes the product's value.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, securing even $5 more than my alternative buyer is a win in this scenario."
