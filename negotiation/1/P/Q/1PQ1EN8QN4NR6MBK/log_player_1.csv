I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm hoping to capitalize on the potential value Bob might see in the product.  If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $15,000, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a higher price."
