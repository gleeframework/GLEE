"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a special offer considering its worth to you and I hope it aligns with your budget. If you have any questions or need more information, please let me know. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John at a better price."
