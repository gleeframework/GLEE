{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $119."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring a sale. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.

Offering the product at $119 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob gets the product for $19 less than his perceived value ($119 vs. a potential $100 value).
* **Alice's Perspective:** Alice makes a profit of $19 ($119 selling price - $100 minimum acceptable price), which is better than selling to John for $120. 

This strategy aims for the highest possible price Bob might accept while still exceeding Alice's minimum."
