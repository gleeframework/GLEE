"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $125 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $100, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 
 
I'm still trying to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I believe $160 is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial offer and my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum price of $150.  I've already had three rounds of negotiations, and there's a risk that he'll continue to lowball me. I'm confident I can get my desired price from John, so I'll take the guaranteed $150."
