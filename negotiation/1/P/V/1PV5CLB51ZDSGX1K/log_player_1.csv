Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. She knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product to Bob for a price between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,200,000 (John's offer) creates a potential win-win. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By starting at $1,100,000, Alice leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle while still aiming for a price significantly higher than her minimum. 

This strategy allows Alice to:

1. **Potentially secure a higher sale price than John's offer.**
2. **Maintain the option of a guaranteed sale with John** if Bob rejects the offer."
