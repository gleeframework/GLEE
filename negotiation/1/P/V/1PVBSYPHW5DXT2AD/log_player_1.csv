"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is far too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still above my minimum of $150, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I hope this shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'll keep trying to negotiate with him, but if his next offer isn't better, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $160. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him, but I need to get closer to my minimum price."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counter again, but if he doesn't budge, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}

This is my final offer to Bob. It's only $5 above my minimum and I'm hoping he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I'm going to sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I've made several compromises, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
