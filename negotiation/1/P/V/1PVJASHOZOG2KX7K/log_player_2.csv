"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is willing to go down to $13,500, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Since he can get the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
