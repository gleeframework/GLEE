I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to get close to my bottom line."

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a little lower than my last offer, but I'm hoping that this is a price that Bob will find acceptable. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to lose patience.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
