"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $12000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
