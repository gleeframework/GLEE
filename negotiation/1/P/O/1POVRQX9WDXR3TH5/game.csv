"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and leaves room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $950000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but offers a more attractive deal for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
