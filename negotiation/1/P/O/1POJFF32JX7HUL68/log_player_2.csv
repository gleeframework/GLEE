"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, giving you ample opportunity to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet in the middle. I am proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $875,000,  which is closer to my initial offer. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I've given this some thought, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm willing to sell the product for $887,500. This price reflects the value to you while allowing us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $875,000.  At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a few thousand dollars of savings. Accepting the offer allows you to buy the product for a reasonable price and move on. It's also important to consider that you only have 5 rounds remaining, and you could potentially end up buying from John for $1,000,000 if you don't close the deal with Alice."
