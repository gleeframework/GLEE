"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price. How about we start at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum price point of $1,000,000. This increases the likelihood of Alice accepting, while still saving Bob a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is cutting it a bit close. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than John's offer of $1,200,000 and closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
