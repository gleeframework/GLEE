Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its significant value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,000,000, Bob values the product much higher. Our goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation wiggle room if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justify the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value and Bob's specific use case, making the high price more palatable.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high sale price and avoiding a rejection that forces us to accept John's lower offer."
