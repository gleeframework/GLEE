{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but leaves room for potential compromise. It also positions the price as fair to both parties, which can be helpful in building rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to both of us while allowing me to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can secure a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit to $975,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, while still being a great deal for you. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $960,000 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while also saving me some money. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer will secure a good profit, and it's likely that further negotiations will only lead to a smaller gain."
