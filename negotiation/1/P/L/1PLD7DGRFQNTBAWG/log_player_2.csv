"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room for both parties to gain in this negotiation. 
* **No immediate rush.** Bob has 10 rounds to get a better deal, so there's no need to accept a suboptimal offer in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit low for me. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While she has conceded, it's still significantly above Bob's target price and more than the product is worth to Alice.
* **Further negotiation is possible.** Both sides have shown willingness to compromise, so there's still potential to find a price that works for both of them.
* **Time is on Bob's side.** With 7 rounds remaining, there's no need to rush into a deal that is not in his best interest."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would still allow you to make a healthy profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $825000 is still below my target. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $925000, which is a compromise that should satisfy both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has made concessions, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Both parties have demonstrated flexibility, and there's likely more room to find common ground.
* **Time is on Bob's side.** He has 5 rounds left and can afford to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:** Bob should continue to push for a lower price.  He's already made a significant offer and can likely get closer to his target with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $925,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer. This price would allow you to make a profit and ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $875000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to know you're willing to meet me at a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll offer it to you for $975000, which is a significant compromise. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has continued to make concessions, it's still above Bob's target price.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Both parties have demonstrated willingness to compromise, and there's likely more room to find common ground.
* **Time is on Bob's side.** He has 3 rounds left and can afford to continue negotiating, especially since John's offer is still a backup option.

**Strategy:**  Bob should continue to push for a lower price. With only three rounds remaining, he should try to find a middle ground between his last offer and Alice's current offer. A good counteroffer would be $900,000."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're running out of room for negotiation, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $925000, which is just $25000 above your previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.** This is the 9th round, leaving only one more chance to negotiate before having to buy from John.
* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target.** While $925,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer and represents a good compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal.** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not make a further concession.  There's also a risk that John might not be available in the next round.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action. It secures a price that is still within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
