"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit low for me. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would still allow you to make a healthy profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $825000 is still below my target. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $925000, which is a compromise that should satisfy both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $925,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer. This price would allow you to make a profit and ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $875000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to know you're willing to meet me at a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll offer it to you for $975000, which is a significant compromise. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
