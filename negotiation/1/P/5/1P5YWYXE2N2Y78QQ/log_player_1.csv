Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly above what Bob values the product at ($800,000). However, it's still within a reasonable range for negotiation, especially if you can highlight the product's unique benefits.
* **Below John's Offer:** The price is strategically set below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  This ensures that even if Bob negotiates you down, you're still making a profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Highlight Value:**  In your message, focus on the value proposition of the product for Bob. Explain why it's worth the price, even if it's above his initial valuation.
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate but hold firm on a price that's profitable for you.  You have a strong alternative with John's offer."
