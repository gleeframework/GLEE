{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something truly unique and valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's high enough to give you a good profit, but it's not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected by Bob. We'll see how Bob responds, and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  While Bob seems interested, his offer is too low to consider.  I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12,000 to make this work. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
