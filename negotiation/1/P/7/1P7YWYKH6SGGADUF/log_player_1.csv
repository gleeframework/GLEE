Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a strong position to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a good deal. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if offered publicly, encouraging Bob to consider the immediate purchase. 
 
This strategy aims to balance ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
