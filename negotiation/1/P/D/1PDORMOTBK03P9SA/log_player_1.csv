"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or make a counteroffer that I can work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I believe I can still do better. Bob's offer is low, and I'm confident I can get a higher price if I negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my ideal price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price and a reasonable compromise.  I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's more than my minimum and still allows me to make a good profit.  I'm also running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with John's lower offer."
