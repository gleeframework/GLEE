Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I value highly. I think you'll find it useful too. I'm willing to let it go for $145. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept this price, netting a profit even if it's less than what John offers.
* **Strategic Justification:** By mentioning I value the product highly, I create a perceived sense of value, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price. 
 
This approach balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a guaranteed sale to John if needed."
