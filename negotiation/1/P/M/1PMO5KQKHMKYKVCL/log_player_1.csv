Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm serious about selling, but not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation,  it's too far off.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above Bob's initial offer.  This shows flexibility while maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will be fruitful.  John is a sure thing at a price that meets my minimum requirement. I'm going to sell to John."
