"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $17000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. Although it's tempting to close the deal, I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $15500.  This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is a good price, and it's getting close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with only $15,000 from John."
