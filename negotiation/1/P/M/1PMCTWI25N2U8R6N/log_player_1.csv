{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $950,000.  I'm confident it's worth far more than that in the long run given its potential."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, my goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to price it below that to entice him.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""premium"" nature and long-term value helps justify the high price. 

By offering it at $950,000, there's a chance Bob sees the value and accepts, giving me a higher profit than selling to John."
