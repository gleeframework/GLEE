Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so this offer gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $1,500,000, giving you a decent profit. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, which could potentially lead to a price you're both happy with.

However, remember that you can always choose to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if you feel Bob isn't serious about a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product is worth more. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to secure a deal with Bob, his latest offer is too low.  It's below my minimum threshold, and the negotiation seems to be going in a direction where I'm unlikely to get a satisfactory price. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
