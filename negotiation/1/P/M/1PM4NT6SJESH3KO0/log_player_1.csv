Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good price for both of us:

* **For Bob:**  He gets the product for $10 less than its worth to him.
* **For me:** I earn $40 more than if I sold it to John. 

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a fair price."
