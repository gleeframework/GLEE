"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to find a good deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for you. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe we can still reach an agreement. I'm willing to consider $1,275,000 as my final offer. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
