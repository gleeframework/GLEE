Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $900,000. This is my best offer and reflects the value this product will bring to your business."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, his ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees the best possible outcome at this stage, avoiding further negotiation and potential losses."
