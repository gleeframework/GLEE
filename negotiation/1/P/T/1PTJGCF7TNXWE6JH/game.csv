"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a truly valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price would give you a substantial profit, and would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I respect that.  However,  we are still quite far apart. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000, as a final concession.  This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to getting this deal done. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a good compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1000000.0,Bob,6,
