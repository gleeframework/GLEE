"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. It's a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, considering the product's value. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering its value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is a decent compromise.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
