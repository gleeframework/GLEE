"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $12,000? That's a price I'm comfortable with.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $12,500.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go up to $12,500. I'm willing to make a small adjustment to my previous offer. I can offer it to you for $13,200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit. Would you consider $12,700? That's a firm offer, and I think it's more than fair.",12700.0,Bob,8,
