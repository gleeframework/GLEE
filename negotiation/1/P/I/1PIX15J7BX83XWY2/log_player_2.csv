"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob should reject the offer. $900,000 is still too high, and there's potential to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $850,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is increasing her offer, but it's still not a good deal for Bob. He should continue negotiating for a lower price.  Buying from John at this point is too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is staying firm on his desire for a good deal. He increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a lower price point. This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to Bob's limit, but she's still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  Buying from John at this point is still too expensive.  There are several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might cave."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to accepting the deal, but he wants to get the price as low as possible.  Offering $900,000 demonstrates his willingness to compromise, but it also puts the pressure on Alice to make a final decision.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might be forced to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  It's risky to buy from John at this point, because there are still a few rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might cave.  Bob can still potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is Bob's final push.  He's offering a price that's very close to Alice's previous offer, demonstrating that he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide - either accept and close the deal, or risk losing it to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  With only one round left, Alice is clearly not going to budge much further.  The deal is now very close to the price of John's offer.  While Bob could technically make another counteroffer, it's unlikely to be accepted, and it would be risky to push Alice any further. Buying from John at this point is the safest option to ensure Bob gets the product and doesn't risk getting stuck with nothing at all."
