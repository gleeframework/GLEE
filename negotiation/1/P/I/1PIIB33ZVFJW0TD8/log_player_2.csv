"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice, and he doesn't want to rush into buying from John at his full price limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to save some money.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he still has room to negotiate further and potentially get an even better deal. He should continue trying to push the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,875.  This would allow both of us to get a good deal, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down significantly from her initial offer and is only $100 above his ideal price.  He can't be sure he'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds, and risking it could lead to him having to buy from John at a higher price."
