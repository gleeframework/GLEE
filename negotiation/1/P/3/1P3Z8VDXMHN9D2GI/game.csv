"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, but I need you to meet me halfway. Can you do that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, and I'm willing to throw in an additional $5 for shipping to make it a fair deal. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
