{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000.  This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves him room for a substantial profit if he utilizes the product effectively.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This offer balances my desire for the highest possible price with the understanding that a slightly lower price to Bob still yields a significant profit compared to my minimum acceptable price."
