"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I can get from another seller. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit low for me. Considering the quality and value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $110, which would be $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
