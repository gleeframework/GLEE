"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it for $1,150,000.  This is a fair starting point considering the substantial benefit it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's benefits to Bob's specific context, I'm reinforcing the value proposition and justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains amicable and suggests a willingness to negotiate.  I don't want to scare Bob away with an unreasonably high first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. I'm willing to engage in further rounds to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement. I'm not overly concerned about time pressure yet as we're only in round 2."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of its value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,110,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair price that reflects the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer but not going below $1,100,000. This signals flexibility while reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win, highlighting its fairness for both parties. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By proposing a specific number and explaining my reasoning, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward toward a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,080,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating a strong interest in the product.  I'm still comfortable rejecting at $1,080,000. While time is a factor, I'm willing to risk another round or two to see if I can push closer to $1,100,000.  The difference is substantial enough to justify continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your commitment to finding a solution is appreciated. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,095,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, while still reflecting the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1095000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We are getting closer to a likely deal point. By suggesting a middle ground, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Time Consideration:** With half the rounds remaining,  offering a price close to his last counteroffer  adds a sense of urgency and encourages a quick resolution. 
* **Above Minimum:** This price point still secures a significant profit above my minimum and is a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I would like to propose an offer of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for small increments carries the risk of Bob walking away.  
* **Acceptable Profit:** $1,075,000 is a strong profit margin above my minimum, and I should prioritize securing the deal at this point. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the potential delays and uncertainty of further rounds, allowing me to move forward."
