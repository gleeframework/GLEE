**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently refusing to budge beyond a certain price point. He's unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. At this stage, the potential gains from continuing negotiations with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John. It makes the most financial sense to cut losses and sell to John."
