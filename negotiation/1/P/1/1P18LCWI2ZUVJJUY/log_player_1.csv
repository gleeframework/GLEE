"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'm also framing the offer positively to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still a loss for me. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum of $150.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Therefore, I'll choose to sell to John for $150, which is a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's offer."
