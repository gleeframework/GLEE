"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can we meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $12500. How about we meet in the middle at $11250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to be flexible, but $11250 is still a bit too low.  I can come down to $13000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider $12500 again? I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on a price.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to come down to $14000 as a final offer.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful it will allow us to close the deal today. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,7,
