Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000. While it is tempting, it is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation or by selling to John."
