"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I believe could be worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you.  
* While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating or going with John. 

**Next Steps:**

Since you're rejecting Alice's offer, you should try negotiating a lower price with her before resorting to buying from John at your maximum budget."
