"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,750. I can do $8,200, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
