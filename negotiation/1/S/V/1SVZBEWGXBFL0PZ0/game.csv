,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
