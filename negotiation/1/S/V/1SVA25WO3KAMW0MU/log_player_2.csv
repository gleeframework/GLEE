"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than my budget. I will try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counter-offer that is slightly above Alice's value for the product ($120).  This gives me some room to negotiate upward if needed, while still aiming for a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but slowly. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm looking for a more significant price drop.  It's still early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering Alice her exact value for the product. This is a strong offer, and it signals that I'm serious about buying but also aware of the product's worth. It will be interesting to see how Alice responds."
