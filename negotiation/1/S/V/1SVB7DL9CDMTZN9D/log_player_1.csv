Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to get even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $140 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), but it leaves room for negotiation if he's interested. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum. 

This approach aims to find a price that works for both parties while maximizing my potential profit."
