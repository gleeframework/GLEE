"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $11,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  Acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses interest.
* **Clear about budget:**  Indicates that $11,000 is too high.
* **Reasonable counter:** $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still provides a potential profit margin for her (remember, it's worth $10,000 to Alice).

By starting with a lower counter-offer, we give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to stay well below our $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already let it go at $11,000 once, and I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the $9,000 we hoped for, it's a significant savings compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away, and we might end up having to buy from John at the higher price. This offer represents a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
