I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for it. Can you meet me at that price?,87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $87.50 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $88.50. This is my final offer.",88.5,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $86 for it. That's the best I can do.,86.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm going to have to stick to my previous offer of $88.50. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",88.5,Alice,7,
