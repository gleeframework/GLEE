"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you, we propose a price of $100 for it. We're confident this is a fair offer that respects both the value of the product and your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, given the quality and value of our product, I cannot agree to $85. I propose a price of $90 for the product, which I believe strikes a balance between respecting the product's value and accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $90 is still within your budget and is a good deal considering you value the product at $120.  You can save $30 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount."
