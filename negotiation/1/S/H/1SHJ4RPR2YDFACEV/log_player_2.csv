Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, I'm looking to save as much money as possible and $15,000 is well above my budget. It's best to reject the offer and see if we can negotiate a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,800 is getting closer, it's still a bit above what I can afford right now.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $12,500. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,400, which is very close to my budget. However, I'm only willing to spend $12,000. At this point, I'm running out of time and rounds. I don't want to risk Alice rejecting my counteroffer and losing the opportunity to buy the product.  John is offering the product at my desired price, so it's safer to purchase from him."
