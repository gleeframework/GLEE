"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,800 is getting closer, it's still a bit above what I can afford right now.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $12,500. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
