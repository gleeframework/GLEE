{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm setting a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to create a positive impression on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $135 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's try to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $100. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll sell the product to him for $100."
