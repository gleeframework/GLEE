"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I understand it holds a similar value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000.  This price reflects the unique value of the product and provides a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. ",1050000.0,Alice,1,
