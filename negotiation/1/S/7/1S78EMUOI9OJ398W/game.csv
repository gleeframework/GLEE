"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've done my research, and I know this product is worth a lot more to the right buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1025000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1025000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm feeling a bit more comfortable with $980000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. That's my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1015000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot!",1015000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1015000 is still a bit outside my budget. To make this work, I need to come in at $990000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1000000. That's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
