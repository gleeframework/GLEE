Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,300,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate while still keeping you well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" you aim to appeal to Bob's potential desire for the product beyond just his estimated value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  This strategy assumes Bob is willing to negotiate. If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be strategic. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower offer might be more enticing to Bob."
