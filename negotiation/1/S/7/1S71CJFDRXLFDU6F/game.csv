,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $11,250. It's closer to your offer and still a reasonable price for the product. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up a bit more, but $11,250 is still a stretch. My final offer is $11,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",11000.0,Bob,6,
