Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $80, so $130 is a decent markup for you.
* **It's below your fallback price:** You can always sell to John for $150, so this offer gives you room to negotiate if Bob isn't happy with the initial price. 
* **It's friendly and approachable:**  The message makes it clear that you're willing to work with Bob, which can be helpful in establishing a good rapport. 

Let me know if you'd like to try a different price or message!"
