"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my valuation and leaves me with a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can bridge the gap. It's possible Bob will increase his offer in subsequent rounds, especially if he's truly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. This shows him that I'm serious about a deal, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident we can close the deal at a more acceptable price.  I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This is a significant concession on my part, showing Bob I'm motivated to close a deal. With only three rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  I'm hoping this will push Bob to counter with a final offer that I can accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining time, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's time to secure the deal with John."
