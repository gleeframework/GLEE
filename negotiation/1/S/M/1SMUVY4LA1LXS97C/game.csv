"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  How about $850,000?  This still leaves a good amount of profit for you and feels more fair to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $800,000? This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
