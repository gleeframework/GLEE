"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price above your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer is also a way to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate.  His response will provide valuable information for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, we always have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000. This provides a safety net and leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately far beyond my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing for a profitable transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000), indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below My Minimum:** However, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Early Stage:** We're only in round 2 of 10.  It's too early to accept an offer so far below my target, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price while giving myself more time to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm eager to strike a deal, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,800,000? This price reflects the true worth of this product."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've moved down from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. This new price is closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I've reiterated the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Still Above Minimum:** Importantly, this counteroffer is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, preserving my safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the product's value, $1,800,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This price leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it reflects the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob has consistently increased his offer, showing serious interest.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Accepting now provides immediate profit and avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down later. It's often better to secure a good deal rather than risk losing it by being overly aggressive."
