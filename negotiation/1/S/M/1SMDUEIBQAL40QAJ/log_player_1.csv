Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible while still offering Bob a price that seems like a good deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is fair for both of us. This gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I receive appropriate compensation for its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $1,050,000  This allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $150,000 gain.
* **The Message:** 
    * Emphasize the ""unique value and potential"" to remind Bob why he's willing to pay more than your minimum.
    * Frame the price as ""fair for both of us"" to encourage agreement.
    * Avoid appearing greedy by mentioning ""appropriate compensation.""

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's eagerness to buy."
