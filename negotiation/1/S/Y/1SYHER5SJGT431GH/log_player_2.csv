"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  My minimum acceptable price is $800000, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to $900000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
