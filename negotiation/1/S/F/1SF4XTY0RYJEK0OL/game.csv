"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a compromise at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $1,000,000. That's my firm offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need you to meet me halfway on this one. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
