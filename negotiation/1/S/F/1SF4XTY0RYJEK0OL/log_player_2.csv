Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need you to meet me halfway on this one. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It seems Alice is firm on her price of $1,050,000. While I could try to push for $1,000,000, there's a risk she won't budge, and I'd end up with a worse deal or having to go with John anyway. Accepting the $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise and saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer."
