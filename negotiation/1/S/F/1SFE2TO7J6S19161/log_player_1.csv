"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and provide a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value helps justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** The $2,000,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), allowing space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity to consider this product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly above his perceived value of the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation to bridge the gap between his offer and your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It demonstrates your understanding of the product's potential. To find a mutually agreeable price, I'm proposing $1,850,000. I believe this adjustment reflects the product's true value and paves the way for a successful deal."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By reducing the price by $150,000, we show willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Anchoring:**  This counteroffer acts as a new anchor point, shifting the negotiation closer to our desired range. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value helps to justify the relatively small concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. While I understand the value you see in this product, I must respectfully decline the $1,850,000 offer. My final counteroffer is $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, but it's still worth exploring if you can negotiate a better deal. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With 6 rounds remaining, you have some leeway to push for a higher price before considering John's offer. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, you can gauge how committed Bob is to acquiring the product. It might prompt him to increase his offer further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation. Your offer demonstrates a serious interest in the product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,800,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing $1,800,000, you're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,750,000) and your previous counteroffer ($1,850,000). This demonstrates fairness and a willingness to find a compromise.
* **Final Push:** This offer can be positioned as your final concession, emphasizing that you're seeking a deal but won't go below this price point.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's essential to nudge Bob towards a decision and avoid prolonged negotiations that could lead to a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but after further reflection, I am unable to accept $1,800,000. My final counteroffer remains at $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has repeated his offer twice, indicating a strong resistance to going higher.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Acceptable Offer:** $1,750,000 is a significant profit, even though it's below your initial target. Holding out for more might result in losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a breakdown.  It's better to take the sure profit than risk losing Bob and potentially getting a lower offer later."
