"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your feedback, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price reflects the product's quality and the value it brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a revised offer of $10,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
