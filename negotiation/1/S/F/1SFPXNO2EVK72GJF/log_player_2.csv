"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than what you're currently considering. However, I understand the market dynamics and am willing to make a special offer. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $95? This price reflects my desire to ensure you receive a great deal while also allowing me to cover costs and make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is lower than her product's value to her ($120), it's still higher than your maximum budget of $80 and what John offers. You can save $15 by going with John."
