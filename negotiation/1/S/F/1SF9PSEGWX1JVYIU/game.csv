"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with significant potential.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm starting with an offer of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. I'm confident this is a fair price given my needs.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it reflects the product's true worth. Let's work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to offer a price of $950000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to find common ground.  However, $1100000 is still outside my financial constraints.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our continued negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1000000 still falls short of the true value of this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This compromise reflects a significant adjustment from my previous offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us before time runs out.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1050000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $980000. This price reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",980000.0,Bob,8,
