"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with significant potential.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm starting with an offer of $2,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. I'm confident this is a fair price given my needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the minimum value I've set for the product ($1,500,000). I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range.  There are still 8 rounds left, giving me room to counter-offer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it reflects the product's true worth. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to offer a price of $950000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price with more negotiation. I have 6 rounds left, and a counteroffer might get us closer to a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to find common ground.  However, $1100000 is still outside my financial constraints.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our continued negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. With 4 rounds left, I believe there's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a price that satisfies both of us.  I'm going to counter-offer with a price closer to $1,100,000, hoping to secure a better deal without risking losing a substantial profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 still falls short of the true value of this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This compromise reflects a significant adjustment from my previous offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1050000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $980000. This price reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiations have stalled.  While $980,000 is a significant increase from Bob's initial offers, it still falls short of my minimum value of $1,500,000.  There's a high risk that Bob won't budge further, and I'm running out of time.  To secure a guaranteed profit and avoid potential loss, it's best to sell the product to John at $1,500,000. This ensures a satisfactory return and minimizes the risk of a less favorable deal with Bob."
