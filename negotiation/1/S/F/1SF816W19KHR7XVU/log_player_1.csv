I'm starting with my minimum price. It's a risky move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay top dollar. If he rejects, I'll have to consider lowering my price or taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away my product for a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm lowering my price by $1,000, but I'm still holding firm on a profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
