Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had from others, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 gives you room to potentially negotiate down closer to Bob's perceived value of $8,000 while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency and Value:** Highlighting other interest and framing the offer as time-sensitive could encourage Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down towards $10,000.  You hold a strong position knowing John is a guaranteed backup buyer."
