Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150, but still below John's offer. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also incentivizes him to accept quickly to avoid losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price below $150 unless I have no other option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm adjusting my price down to $155, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'm getting closer to his price. However, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and lose the deal.  John is a sure thing, offering me my minimum.  It's time to accept John's offer and move on."
