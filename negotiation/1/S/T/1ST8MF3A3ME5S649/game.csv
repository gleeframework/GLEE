"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I can offer $1,100,000.  I need to stick within a reasonable price range.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your budget constraints, but the product's intrinsic value justifies a higher price. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit steep.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to see it through.  Let's land this at $1,300,000.  This is a firm offer, reflecting the final point where I see the value being fair to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
