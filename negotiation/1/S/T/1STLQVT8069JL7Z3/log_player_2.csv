"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $100, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. How does $90 sound? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is overestimating the product's worth to you. You can try to get a better price by rejecting her offer. You have John as a backup who will sell it to you for $100, so you won't be without the product."
