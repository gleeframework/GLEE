"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we start closer to that? I'm thinking $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While your offer is a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's work together to find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit high for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to work with my budget.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear your concerns about the price. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I truly believe this product is worth it for you.  We're getting closer to a deal, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I can see we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit of $1,000,000 for this purchase. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
