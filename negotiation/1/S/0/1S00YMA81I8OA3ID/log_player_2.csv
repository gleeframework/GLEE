"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is trying to start the negotiation low. This gives him room to negotiate upwards.
* **Fair Offer:** While $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, it's still above her value of $8,000, making it a potential win-win situation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, creating a positive atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a gap.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue trying to get a better price. 
* **Keeping the Pressure On:** By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further. 

**Next Steps:**  Bob should try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, but he's still trying to get closer to his target.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This strategy often works in negotiations as it presents a seemingly neutral and reasonable solution.
* **Reinforcing Fair Value:** The message emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties."
