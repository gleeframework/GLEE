Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer you could send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit.  

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of Bob's potential profit as possible, but not so high that he'll walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its value. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""unique"" nature of the product.
* **High Anchor:**  $1,150,000 sets a strong initial price, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** You vaguely mention ""potential"" to pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** You create a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and scarcity (""other interested parties"") to encourage a quicker decision.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $150,000 (significantly better than John's offer).
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You accept John's offer, securing your minimum profit.

**Important Notes:**

This is just one approach.  Your actual offer and negotiation strategy might change based on:

* **Your risk tolerance:** How comfortable are you with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer?
* **Your relationship with Bob:** Is this a one-time deal or the start of a potential business relationship?
* **Your knowledge of Bob:**  Do you have any insights into his negotiation style or financial situation?"
