Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $100, which is a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a sense of a fair deal and encourages him to accept.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he decides to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $80 and leaves me with a decent profit.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a rejection altogether."
