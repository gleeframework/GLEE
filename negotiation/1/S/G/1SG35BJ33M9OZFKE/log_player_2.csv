# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to make a serious offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. You're looking to save money, so rejecting her offer and negotiating is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to spend $10500, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting closer to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $11250, which is $11125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is very close to your target price.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price through further negotiation, and you risk running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price."
