"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $18,000 is too high for my budget.  How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. How about we settle at $10,000? That's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000, which would be $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11000.0,Alice,5,
