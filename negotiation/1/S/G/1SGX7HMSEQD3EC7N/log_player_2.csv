"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,000,000. You can potentially save money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interests. However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still higher than your maximum price of $1,000,000.  It's likely that further negotiation with Alice will continue to be difficult, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.  Since you have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to go with that option and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
