Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that allows me to earn more than my minimum value and leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's only slightly above my minimum value of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110.  This shows flexibility while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise and hope Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer. It's likely he won't budge further, and selling to John will net me a lower profit. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
