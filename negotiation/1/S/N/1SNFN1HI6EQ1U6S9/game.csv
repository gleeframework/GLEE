"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value, and I believe you might be the right person. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1500000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to move the deal forward, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise to move the deal forward. Considering your last offer, I'm thinking of a price of $1275000. This is a bit above your last offer, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be confident that we're getting close to a fair price for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
