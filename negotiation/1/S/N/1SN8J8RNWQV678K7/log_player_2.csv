"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good start, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his $80 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if that's acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $100. This allows us both to find a middle ground. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's goal, he's still aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to the $80 price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $95. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with $97. This seems like a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has two choices:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This gets him the product for $97, which is a good deal but still a bit higher than John's offer.
* **Reject Alice's offer:** This risks further negotiations, potentially leading to a higher price or stalling the deal, especially with limited rounds remaining. 

Considering the limited rounds and the possibility of Alice raising the price again, it's a better strategy for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that's still within his budget."
