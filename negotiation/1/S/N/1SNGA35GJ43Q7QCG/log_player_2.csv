Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I value finding common ground, I believe $1,350,000 undervalues the product's potential.  My final offer is $1,360,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true worth.
