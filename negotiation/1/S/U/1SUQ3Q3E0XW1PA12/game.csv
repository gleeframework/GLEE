"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true value and would still be a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  To be fair, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope you'll consider it. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,275,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,275,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm thinking $1,300,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
