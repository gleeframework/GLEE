"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth at least $10,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
