{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a high price ($20,000) to see if Bob is truly interested.
* **Enthusiastic message:** The message is positive and conveys the value of the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects it.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $8000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. It's not worth accepting this offer, as it would result in a substantial loss. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. This will allow me to try and find a price that's more acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer of $17,000.
* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial $20,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I'm explaining why my counteroffer is still fair, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to discussion:**  I end the message with a call to action, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap between my minimum value and Bob's initial offer, while also leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $17000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $10000. It's a fair price considering my budget and what I'm looking for in this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While there's a possibility we could find a middle ground with more negotiation, it's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to meet my expectations. 

To avoid the risk of further negotiations that might not lead to a satisfactory price, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids potentially getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
