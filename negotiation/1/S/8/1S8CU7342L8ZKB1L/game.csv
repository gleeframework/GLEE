"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $812,500? ",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $812,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $825,000. I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $840,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",840000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire. I'm willing to come up slightly to $830,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",830000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that time is of the essence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $830,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $835,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",835000.0,Alice,9,
