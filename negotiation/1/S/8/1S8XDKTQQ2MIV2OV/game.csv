"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $95?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, as a final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,5,
