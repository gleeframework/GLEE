{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm happy to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  My message indicates I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to engage.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is showing interest,  I believe I can secure a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which gives me the leverage to counter Bob's offer and potentially get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but remaining open to negotiation.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Remaining Firm:**  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($150), but it's a reasonable offer that might be appealing to Bob.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, giving me the confidence to push for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $95?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob, especially since he's clearly interested in the product.

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, as a final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm indicating that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Compromise:** While $100 is still above my minimum, it's a significant compromise from my previous offer ($105). 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price. 
* **John's Offer:** My fallback option with John is still a strong motivator to reach an agreement with Bob.  

This offer balances the need to get a reasonable price with the risk of losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer."
