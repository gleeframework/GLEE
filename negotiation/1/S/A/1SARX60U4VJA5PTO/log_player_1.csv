"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I believe I can get a higher price, especially since Bob already showed interest with his counteroffer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still leaves room for potential profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise, and we can close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price, and we're already in round 4.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  Accepting this offer will ensure I get a good price and close the deal."
