"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,025,000 is a better price than John's, it's still higher than what Bob is comfortable with.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference - $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and balanced price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Current Offer:** Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's lower than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential reward of a slightly lower price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision for Bob, balancing potential savings with the risk of a failed negotiation."
