"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1000000 to $1200000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1100000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1250000 for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1350000, so I'm counteroffering at $1325000. This is my final concession, and I hope you'll take it. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised you're still trying to push for $1300000, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $1320000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,9,
