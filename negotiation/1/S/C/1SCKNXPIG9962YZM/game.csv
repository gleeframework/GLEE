"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a reasonable price, and it would allow me to get this great product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
