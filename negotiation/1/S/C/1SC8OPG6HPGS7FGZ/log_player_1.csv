Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potential profit above your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,400,000 offer is:
    * Substantially higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you negotiating room.
    *  Significantly closer to your guaranteed sale price, minimizing potential losses if Bob rejects the offer. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible price from Bob while retaining the safety net of John's offer."
