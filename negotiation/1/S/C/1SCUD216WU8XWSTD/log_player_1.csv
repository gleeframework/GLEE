Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm not going to accept Bob's lowball offer.  He's only offering $1,200,000, which is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to my desired price.  If it doesn't work out, I'll sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,200,000 is just too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but let's find a compromise.

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I think I can get closer to my goal if I keep negotiating. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think we're getting close to my limit. How about $1,240,000?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $1,240,000 is still too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,260,000.

```

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer.  He's only offering $1,230,000, which is still significantly below my minimum. We've reached an impasse, and I've already run out of time to negotiate further.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk a lower price or getting stuck in an endless loop of counteroffers."
