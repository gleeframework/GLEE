Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this offer reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 aims to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 allows for a bolder initial ask.

This strategy prioritizes securing the highest possible price from Bob, knowing there's a reliable backup option available."
