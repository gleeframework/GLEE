{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant returns you'll see.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signals a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he might be willing to pay more if he sees significant potential beyond that.
* **Market Dynamics:** Are there other potential buyers besides John? If the market is competitive, Bob might be more inclined to accept a higher price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still being realistic about the possibility of selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
