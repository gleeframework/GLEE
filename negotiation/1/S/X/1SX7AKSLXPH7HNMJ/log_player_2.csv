Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,500 is closer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about we meet at $8,500? This is a good midpoint between our positions, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000. You'll save $500 and avoid further negotiation."
