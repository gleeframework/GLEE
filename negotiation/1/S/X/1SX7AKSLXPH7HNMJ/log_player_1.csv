"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and the opportunity for Bob to get a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, inviting Bob to counteroffer if necessary.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $15,000. However, I'm also prepared to accept a lower price if necessary, as I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even far lower than my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows that he's interested in the product. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time to Counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, which will hopefully bring us closer to a reasonable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to maintain control over the negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering, and I'm confident that I have enough rounds to find a solution that is more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial price. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a respectable margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, hoping to sway his opinion.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair solution that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to meet Bob halfway, hoping to reach an agreement in the next round.  I'm still confident that I can get a higher price, but I'm willing to make concessions to close the deal and avoid selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Time for Counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and prevent a hasty decision. I still have time to explore better options.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product. My goal is to continue the negotiation until we reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,500 is closer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about we meet at $8,500? This is a good midpoint between our positions, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price that's significantly closer to my desired range. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on Middle Ground:**  I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is a fair midpoint, suggesting that this is a reasonable and equitable solution.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm reiterating that this offer would allow us to close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to reach a compromise that works for both of us. My counteroffer is designed to appeal to Bob's desire for a lower price while also ensuring that I'm not losing too much money. I believe that this offer will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
