"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,500 is closer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about we meet at $8,500? This is a good midpoint between our positions, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
