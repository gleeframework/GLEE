"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident the product is worth more than $12,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a significant margin.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd like to get a better price, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering my own valuation of the product.  I'm hoping Bob will realize the value and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less, especially since John is a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm willing to budge a bit from my minimum price, but I'm still holding out for a reasonable profit. $11,000 is a compromise, but it's still a significant amount for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, it's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price.  It's time to move on and ensure I receive a fair value for my product."
