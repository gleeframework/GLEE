# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to us and its potential to enhance your experience, I propose a price of $110 for it. This offer includes all the features you're looking for and more. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

You're trying to save as much money as possible. Since you can get the product from John for $100, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $100 for the product. This aligns closely with your budget while still allowing us to cover our costs. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your needs.

Alice's offer of $100 is the same price as John's, so there's no benefit to rejecting and counteroffering. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for the lowest price available."
