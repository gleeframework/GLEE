"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it could be very valuable for you. I'm looking to sell it for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $15000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $15000 is a bit below my minimum value for this product.  How about we split the difference? I'd be willing to accept $17500 for it. This would give you a good deal while ensuring I can still cover my costs.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I believe $16000 would be a fair price for us both. This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my spending limit, while also compensating you adequately for your efforts.",16000.0,Bob,4,
