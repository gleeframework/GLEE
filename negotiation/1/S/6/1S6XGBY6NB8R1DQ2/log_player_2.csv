"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's value of $800,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows Bob's serious intent to acquire the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal, potentially closer to the $850,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's offer and closer to Bob's ideal price. This strategy aims to push Alice closer to accepting a price that benefits both parties."
