"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be useful, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we try $13,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
