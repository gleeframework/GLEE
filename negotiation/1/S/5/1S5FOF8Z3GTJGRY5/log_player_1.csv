Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be useful, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we try $13,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $13,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation."
