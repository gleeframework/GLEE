"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $950,000 is certainly a good price, I'm looking for something closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $975,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I respect your offer, $975,000 isn't quite in the ballpark I'm aiming for. To make this work for both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you, and it's closer to my desired value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
