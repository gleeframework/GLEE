"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum threshold of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's above my minimum threshold of $80, I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a price of $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to earn a significant amount of money for the product. I hope this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $82. While it's getting closer to my minimum threshold of $80, I still believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm offering a price of $88. This is a significant concession from my previous offer of $90, but it's still a reasonable price considering Bob's value of the product at $100. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, as I don't want to risk losing too much time in further negotiation and potentially have to settle for John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $84. While it's only $4 above my minimum threshold, I'm concerned about running out of time and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $80. This offer guarantees me a decent profit, and I'm willing to close the deal."
