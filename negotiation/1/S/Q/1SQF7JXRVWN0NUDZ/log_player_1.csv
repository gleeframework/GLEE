"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also signals to Bob that the product is valuable.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low for me, as I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit. I hope Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better.  I'm going to try and counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  I'm willing to go a little lower than my minimum to avoid selling to John, but I'm also not going to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. I'm running out of time, and Bob's offers are still too low. I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price from John to avoid further negotiations and ensure a sale."
