"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned you value it at $800000. Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy the product from her, I'll be paying $900,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal for me.
