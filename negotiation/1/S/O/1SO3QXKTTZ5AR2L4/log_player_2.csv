"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe $800,000 is a bit high considering my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it reflects its true value to me."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, which is good. However, $700,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price.  I'm confident I can get it down closer to my initial counteroffer of $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I recognize the value of the product, $700,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $650,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now closer to my target price.  While I'd like to continue negotiating, I'm concerned that pushing further might risk losing the deal altogether. At this point, accepting Alice's offer and paying $675,000 is a good outcome. It's a substantial savings compared to buying from John, and I've achieved my goal of acquiring the product at a price below my initial target."
