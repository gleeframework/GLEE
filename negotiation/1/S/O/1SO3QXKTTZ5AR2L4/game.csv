"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to your business.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe $800,000 is a bit high considering my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it reflects its true value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I recognize the value of the product, $700,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $650,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",675000.0,Alice,5,
