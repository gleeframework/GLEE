**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand and presented her ""final offer.""  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk she won't budge, forcing us to either accept her offer or go with John for $1,000,000. 

Securing the product for $775,000 is a reasonable deal, saving us $225,000 compared to John's offer.  It's better to take this deal now rather than risk losing out on any savings."
