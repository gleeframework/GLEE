"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and its potential benefits warrant a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has a high intrinsic value, but I still think $1,700,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
