"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your absolute bottom line ($1,500,000). This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price that benefits you.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). His reaction will give you insight into his willingness to negotiate and how much he truly values the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By explicitly stating you're ""open to discussing this further,"" you signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. He jumped straight to what he perceives as a fair price, indicating he might be willing to go higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and its potential benefits warrant a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer helps maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Hold Ground, But Compromise:**  We're coming down from our initial offer, signaling flexibility, but the price is still significantly above Bob's and ensures a profitable deal for you.
* **Clear Justification:** Highlighting the ""intrinsic worth and potential benefits"" reinforces the product's value proposition. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Proposing to ""meet halfway"" frames the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has a high intrinsic value, but I still think $1,700,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,600,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) and a substantial profit.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob explicitly stated this is his highest offer. Trying to push further might lead to him walking away.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, a good deal in hand now is often better than risking a no-deal outcome later."
