Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $8,000, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This allows me to potentially get a better deal than selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've earned a decent profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth negotiating further.  If his counteroffer is too low, I'll either make a counteroffer or accept John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000 and closer to my minimum value of $8,000.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $11,000. This will give Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer of $12,000 was rejected, and Bob's offer of $9,500 is too low. This counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:** It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, but it's also a price that I'm comfortable with. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** This price is significantly higher than the $8,000 offered by John, making it more desirable to sell to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good outcome.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or finally accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting too low:**  While $9,000 is still more than John's offer, it's getting dangerously close to my minimum value of $8,000.
* **Negotiations are stalling:** We've been going back and forth, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go much higher.
* **Risk of losing time and potential profit:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a better outcome.  Continuing could waste time and potentially result in a lower final price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting John's offer is the most logical choice:** It guarantees a quick sale at a price that's close to my minimum value. It's better than risking a lower offer from Bob or potentially getting stuck in a long negotiation process."
