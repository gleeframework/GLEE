"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $150. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll really love it!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $125 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's the best I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we try $115? It's a compromise, and I think we can meet in the middle from there.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I can go up to $100. I hope you can see that this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $100 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",110.0,Alice,7,
