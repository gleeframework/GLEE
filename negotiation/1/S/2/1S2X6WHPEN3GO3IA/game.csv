"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring the price down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",850000.0,Alice,5,
