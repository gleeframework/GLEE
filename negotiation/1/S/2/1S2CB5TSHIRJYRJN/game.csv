"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to move down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To move this forward, I can go up to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  While I appreciate your willingness to move up, the gap between our positions remains significant.  I could consider $1,250,000. This is a firm offer, as I'm already making considerable concessions.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This is pushing my absolute limit, but I value the product and believe we can make a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
