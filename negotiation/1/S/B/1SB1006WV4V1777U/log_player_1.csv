"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) and higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and encouraging to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hoping to get him thinking about its potential benefit to him.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider the remaining rounds. 
* If his counteroffer is close to my minimum value ($1,000,000), I might accept it.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still within a range that I think he might accept.
* If the negotiation stalls or his offers are too low, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum value to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's still interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining My Value:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be the safest option, but I'm willing to risk further negotiation to potentially secure a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* I'll keep a close eye on the remaining rounds, knowing that I can always sell to John if I need to guarantee a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price still offers you a significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while protecting my interests.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to convince him that this is a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, great! I've secured a good price.
* If he rejects, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer. If it's close to my minimum, I might accept. Otherwise, I'll make another counteroffer.
* I'll continue to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $700,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While Bob is moving closer, it's not yet an acceptable price.
* **Opportunity for Compromise:**  Bob's message shows he's willing to compromise further.  This suggests more negotiation is possible. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  While selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, there's a chance Bob might come up to a more acceptable price in the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to $700,000 but still protects my minimum value.  I'll aim for a compromise that's fair to both of us. 
* I'll closely monitor the remaining rounds, knowing I can always sell to John as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's try $850,000. That's a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, bringing the price closer to his offer while still being above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $850,000 is still above Bob's estimate of the product's worth to him, but closer to what I need.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great!  If not, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or sell to John.
* **Consider the Rounds:** With 5 rounds remaining, I'll need to balance finding a deal with Bob against the potential of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a strong offer and would allow me to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While Bob is getting closer, it's not yet a price I can accept.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** With only 4 rounds left, there's still time for Bob to increase his offer further.  I'm not willing to settle for a loss at this point.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, I'm still hoping to get a better deal from Bob.  This decision involves weighing the risk of a lower offer against the potential for a higher one.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while protecting my interests.
* I'll closely monitor the remaining rounds, knowing that I can always sell to John to ensure a sale."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is still a bit low for me,  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, fantastic! I've secured a reasonable price.

* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to making a decision to either close the deal with Bob or secure a guaranteed sale with John."
