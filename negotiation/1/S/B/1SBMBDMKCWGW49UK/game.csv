"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000,  which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a profitable deal.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000, which is $887,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
