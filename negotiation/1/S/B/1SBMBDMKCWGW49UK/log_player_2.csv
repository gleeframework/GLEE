# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000, which is $887,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can likely get a slightly lower price by counteroffering, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $887,500.  Accepting the offer gives Bob a good deal while ensuring he gets the product."
