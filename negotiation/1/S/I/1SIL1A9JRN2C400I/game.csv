"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $16000. Let's see if we can work something out.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product but my budget is firm at $17000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $17500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $17500 is still slightly out of my budget.  To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to go up to $17250. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",17250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $18000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the absolute minimum I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,7,
