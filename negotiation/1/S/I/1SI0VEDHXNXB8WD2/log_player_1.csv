Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob is willing to pay more. My goal is to get as close to his perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,150,000 leaves a good portion of the potential profit for Bob, making it a tempting offer he's likely to accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in negotiations.  If Bob rejects the offer, I still walk away with a substantial profit."
