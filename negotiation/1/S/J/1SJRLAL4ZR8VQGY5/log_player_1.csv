Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""true worth,"" you create a perception of the product's value exceeding the asking price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing further"" signals flexibility, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than reject outright. 

**The Goal:**  This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest at a premium price. It either:

1. **Secures a highly profitable sale:**  Bob accepts the high price or a slightly negotiated figure.
2. **Provides information for negotiation:** Bob's reaction helps determine how much lower you need to go, knowing John provides a safety net."
