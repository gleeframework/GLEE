"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is a good deal, you can likely do better.  You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice values the product at $120. This means there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $75 is a good first step. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and still leaves room for potential negotiation. It signals that you are serious about purchasing the product, but also that you are looking for a good value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is now very close to your maximum price of $100. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether or ending up paying more than you initially wanted.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
