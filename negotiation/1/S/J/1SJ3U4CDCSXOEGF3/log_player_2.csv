Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $80. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice is unlikely to come down to $80.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
