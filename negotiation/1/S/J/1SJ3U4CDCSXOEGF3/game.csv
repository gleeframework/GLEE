"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do like the product, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $120. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could we settle somewhere around $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $80. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
