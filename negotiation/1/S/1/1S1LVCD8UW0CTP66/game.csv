,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 was a bit high, but $15000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck in a loop here. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $16250. If that's still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16250.0,Alice,7,
