"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let's make it happen!",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and we could finalize the deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,
