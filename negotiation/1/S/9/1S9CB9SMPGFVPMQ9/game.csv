"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the price is still a little steep for me.  Could you consider $950,000? That would make this a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $1,050,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",990000.0,Alice,7,
