Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $950,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. You can still try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.

Alice is now asking for $980,000, which is getting closer to your limit, but still higher than what you're willing to pay. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000. You'll save $180,000 compared to buying from Alice."
