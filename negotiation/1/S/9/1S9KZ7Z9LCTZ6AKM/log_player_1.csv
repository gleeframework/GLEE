{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. I'm hoping to get a counteroffer from Bob and then negotiate from there. I'm also keeping John as an option if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum and  I'm getting closer to my bottom line.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, and John's offer is much more appealing at this point."
