"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  A $100,000 saving is significant, but it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price.
* **You have 10 rounds.**  This gives you plenty of opportunities to try and push for a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within the realm of what Alice might consider. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's still a $50,000 gap between your offer and Alice's initial price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **First move:** It's important to establish a lower starting point for your counteroffers, as Alice will likely counter back with a price closer to her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise.** It's only $25,000 higher than your initial counteroffer and represents a significant saving compared to both John's price and Alice's initial offer.
* **There are still many rounds left.** While you could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases with each round. Accepting now secures a good deal without risking further delays."
