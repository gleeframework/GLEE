"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $130, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $110 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $95 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good opportunity to get something great for a reasonable price. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'd be willing to pay $98 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet at this price.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While $98 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $101.50. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",101.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $101.50 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, so I hope we can make a deal.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your final offer of $99. While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal.  How about we settle at $100? It's a small difference, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm still not willing to pay $100. I've already made it clear that $99 is my maximum. I'm not going to go any higher. I think it's time to walk away from the deal. I'll buy the product from John for $80.,99.0,Bob,10,
