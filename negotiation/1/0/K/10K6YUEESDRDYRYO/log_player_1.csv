"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $130, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly approach can encourage Bob to engage and potentially make concessions.
* **Focus on Value:** Mentioning the product's value subtly suggests that the price is justified. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving a good amount of space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a favorable position while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below my initial offer of $130. Accepting this would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired price point, hoping to find a compromise.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I can afford to reject a few offers and see if Bob will increase his counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's, aiming for a midpoint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate that the price is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach an agreement in this round. If Bob rejects again, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing or moving on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $110 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $95 is slightly better than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob seems willing to negotiate, suggesting there might be room for a higher offer from him.  
* **Time is on My Side:**  With 6 rounds left, I can afford to reject a few more offers and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $95 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good opportunity to get something great for a reasonable price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm continuing to show a willingness to compromise by reducing my price further. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product again, reminding Bob that $105 is still a good deal for him.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that is closer to Bob's price point while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'd be willing to pay $98 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $98 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Limited Negotiating Room:** Bob claims this is his final offer, suggesting there might be less room for further negotiations.
* **Time is Still on My Side:** I have 4 rounds left, giving me some time to assess if there's a chance Bob might increase his offer if I reject. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $150 is still an option, but it's wise to explore if there's any chance I can secure a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's final offer, hoping to find a compromise.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider selling to John, but I'll keep negotiating as long as it seems possible to get closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While $98 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $101.50. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 101.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's final offer ($98) and my previous offer ($105).  This shows a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I reiterate the ""meet you halfway"" aspect, hoping to make it clear that I'm serious about finding a solution.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer is enough to persuade Bob to accept. It's still above my minimum but is a more substantial move towards his desired price. If he rejects, I'll need to consider selling to John or making another counteroffer, depending on how much time is left and how determined Bob seems to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $101.50 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, so I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $99 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has declared this his final offer, but I have two rounds left to try and push for a higher price.
* **Close to Target:** While I'm not getting my desired price, $99 is the closest Bob has come. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob, but there's also a chance that a counteroffer could sway him.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. I'll aim to find a price that is a compromise between my desired price and his final offer, hoping to reach an agreement in the next round. If he rejects, I will then need to seriously consider selling to John, as I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your final offer of $99. While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal.  How about we settle at $100? It's a small difference, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm calling this my final offer to put pressure on Bob. This is my last chance to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a price that's only $1 higher than Bob's final offer, demonstrating that I'm genuinely interested in reaching an agreement.
* **Win-Win Frame:**  I'm emphasizing that $100 is a win-win for both of us, creating a sense of fairness.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk.  I'm hoping to persuade Bob to accept this small compromise and close the deal.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I don't have much room for further negotiation in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to pay $100. I've already made it clear that $99 is my maximum. I'm not going to go any higher. I think it's time to walk away from the deal. I'll buy the product from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Stance:** Bob has made it clear that he won't budge on his offer of $99. He's also stated that he'll buy from John for $80, which means he values the product at $80.
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $150.  
* **Time is Up:** This is the final round of negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit, which is more than what Bob is offering. 

**Conclusion:**

It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point. He's shown that he's unwilling to meet my minimum, and I'm now in a position to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
