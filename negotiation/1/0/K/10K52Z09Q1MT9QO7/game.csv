"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $107.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $109.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
