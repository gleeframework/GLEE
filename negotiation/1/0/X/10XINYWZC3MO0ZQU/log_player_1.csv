Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $14,500. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves me a good amount of profit if Bob accepts immediately.  I'm willing to negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer, but I will also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This shows flexibility while still keeping my profit margin above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he's not willing to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $13,500 will ensure I make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
