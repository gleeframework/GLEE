"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering what the product is worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about we settle on $9,000?  That's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
