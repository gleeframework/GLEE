"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's below your maximum, but you can potentially get a better deal.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have a clear advantage here, knowing Alice's minimum price is $10,000.  
* **You can always fall back on John.**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a backup option. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming to get the price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000. It's a good price for me, and still allows you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12000. This still allows you to get a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.**  It's still a decent saving for you compared to John's price, and it's likely close to Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Further negotiation might be risky.** Pushing for a lower price could lead to Alice walking away, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John. 
* **Time is money.**  You can secure the product now at a good price.

**Next Steps:**

Accept Alice's offer and finalize the purchase!"
