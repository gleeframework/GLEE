Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $8,000 to John, and $10,000 to Bob, so it's worth pushing for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer Bob's $8,500 to see if I can get closer to my desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  How about $8,900?  It's a small increase from your offer, and it would be a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8900}
