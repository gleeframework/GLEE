"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $9,500 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $9,000? ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand this is a tough spot, but I'm really hoping we can find common ground.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $8,800 as a final compromise? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and this price reflects a great value for you.  Let's close this deal.",8800.0,Alice,7,
