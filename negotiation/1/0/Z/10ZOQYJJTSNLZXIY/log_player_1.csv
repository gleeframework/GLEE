"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still below Alice's minimum.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below Alice's minimum value of $12,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. Selling to John immediately would guarantee the minimum value, but Alice still has 9 rounds to try and get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $9,500 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Alice proposes $9,000, a compromise between her previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message reiterates that $8,500 is too low and proposes a specific alternative. It also emphasizes finding a middle ground to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to Alice's minimum value, it's still not ideal. She has already made two concessions and Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. Alice should continue to push for a higher price, aiming to reach a deal closer to her desired $9,000.  Selling to John would guarantee the minimum, but Alice still has 6 rounds to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $9,000 for this to work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,750 and $9,000.  How about $8,875?  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Alice proposes $8,875, again finding a middle ground but this time closer to her previous offer. This shows a commitment to finding a solution but also reinforces that she's not willing to go much lower.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes understanding Bob's budget, but reiterates the need for a higher price.  It also introduces a sense of urgency by mentioning ""final offer"" and ""other options"" to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is close to Alice's minimum value, it's still below her desired outcome, and she's still at an advantage due to having 4 rounds remaining. Accepting Bob's offer would guarantee a sale, but Alice has shown she's willing to walk away from a deal if she doesn't get the desired price.  

Here's the thinking:

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise.  With a few more rounds, Alice could potentially convince him to increase his offer a bit further.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Alice has the power to choose to sell to John. This leverage gives her a strong position in the negotiation.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While selling to John would be a safe option, Alice has already invested time in negotiating with Bob. By continuing, she has the potential to earn more without a significant risk. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, Alice maintains the possibility of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a tough spot, but I'm really hoping we can find common ground.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $8,800 as a final compromise? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and this price reflects a great value for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Alice proposes $8,800, a slight compromise that shows flexibility while remaining above Bob's last offer.  This price is closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a margin for Alice.
* **Message:**  Alice emphasizes her desire to find common ground and highlights the value proposition for Bob. She uses the phrase ""final compromise"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap and secure a deal that is reasonably advantageous for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,750 and $8,800. How about $8,775? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,775. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,775
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is running out of time. With only two rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob agreeing to a higher price is low.  She's already made numerous concessions and is getting closer to her minimum acceptable price.  

Here's why selling to John is the best strategy now:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees Alice her minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring a profit.
* **Time Constraint:** Two rounds left is not enough time to significantly push Bob higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While continuing with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, it also carries the risk of no deal at all, forcing Alice to settle for her minimum.

Selling to John minimizes risk and maximizes her guaranteed profit, making it the most logical choice."
