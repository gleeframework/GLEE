I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get closer to my target.  While his offer is getting closer, it's still not in the range I'm aiming for. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but given Bob's last offer and his comment about going to John, it seems like he's not willing to go much higher. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed sale, and although it's not the ideal price, it's better than nothing."
