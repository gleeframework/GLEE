"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me and allows for a profitable deal for you. ",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. I believe the product's value to you is $8,000, and this price takes that into account.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This would be a win-win situation, allowing you to sell the product and me to acquire it within my budget.  I hope you'll consider my offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
