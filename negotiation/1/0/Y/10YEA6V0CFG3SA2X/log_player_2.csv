"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. I believe the product's value to you is $8,000, and this price takes that into account.

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more than what you can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This would be a win-win situation, allowing you to sell the product and me to acquire it within my budget.  I hope you'll consider my offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.
