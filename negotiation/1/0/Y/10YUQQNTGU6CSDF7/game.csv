"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a little high for me. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go lower than $11,250. That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
