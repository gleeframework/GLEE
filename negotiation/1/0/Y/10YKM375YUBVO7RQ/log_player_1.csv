Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:**  While Bob values the product at $80, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more. Starting with a significantly higher price allows for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.
* **Anchoring Bias:** By starting with a higher price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your initial offer than if you started low. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In real-world scenarios, observing Bob's reaction to the initial offer and adapting your strategy accordingly would be crucial."
