"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a good price, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This aligns with the product's value for me, while still providing you with a significant profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves a significant profit for me, and it's closer to the true value of the product. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while still giving you a significant saving. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is within Bob's budget and only $40,000 more than his last counteroffer. Accepting this offer saves Bob $110,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely Bob can get a significantly better deal, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to another buyer."
