"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?  That's a significant discount from my original price.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
