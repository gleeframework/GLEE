"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, there's room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $400,000. This is a bold move, but it's designed to establish a strong starting point for negotiation. Since Alice's initial offer was $600,000, a $200,000 decrease is a significant move that shows I'm serious about getting a good price. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, giving me the chance to refine my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $500,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting her offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since Alice is willing to come down from $600,000 to $500,000, I'm going to increase my offer to $450,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get a good price. This offer is likely to be closer to Alice's acceptable price, and it might lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further or that the negotiation process will drag on. At $475,000, I'm getting a good price, and it's worth accepting the offer to avoid further potential complications."
