Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price given my budget.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap and finalize the deal.
