"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price given my budget.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap and finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $925,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
