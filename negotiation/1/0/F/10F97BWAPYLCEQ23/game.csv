"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go down to $90 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table.",95.0,Alice,3,
