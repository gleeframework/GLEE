"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price.  Since John is offering the same price, and you have no reason to believe Alice will drop her price, you should buy from John. There's no gain from negotiating with Alice, as the risk is too high."
