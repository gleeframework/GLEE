Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he wants the product badly enough. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than John's offer ($8,000), ensuring Alice a good profit even if Bob declines."
