Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You are willing to pay no more than $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While it's a better price than the initial offer, you are still trying to save as much as possible. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really hoping to get the product for $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  You're getting closer to your target price, but you still have a few rounds to try and negotiate a lower price. It's worth pushing a bit further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to consider that, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your budget. You've gone as high as you're willing to go, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to convince Alice to go lower. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to guarantee you get the product within your budget."
