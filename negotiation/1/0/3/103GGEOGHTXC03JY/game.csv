"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really hoping to get the product for $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to consider that, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",12500.0,Alice,7,
