"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value and my budget.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more than that based on its features and market value. I could come down to $20,000.  This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and my budget.

It's getting close to the point where continuing the negotiation might not yield a significantly better result than accepting Bob's offer. Accepting $17,000 is better than potentially getting stuck closer to John's $15,000 offer."
