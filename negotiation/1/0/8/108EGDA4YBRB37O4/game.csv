"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time.  This is my best and final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate. To find middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. This considers its unique benefits and future potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try this - I can come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. While I am very interested in your product, I am sticking to my offer of $1,000,000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I truly believe it is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
