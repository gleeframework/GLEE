"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob can likely do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, Alice has already come down from her initial price and is offering a price that is still below Bob's maximum. It's a good deal for Bob and a good deal for Alice."
