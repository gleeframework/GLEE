"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as he's shown interest. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we compromise at $7,800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident John will buy the product for $8,000, so I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiations and ensure I get my minimum value."
