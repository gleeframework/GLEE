"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $135.
* **Saving money:** This is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it."
