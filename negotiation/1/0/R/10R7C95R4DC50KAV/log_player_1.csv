{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you some room to negotiate, but it's also lower than your minimum acceptable price, giving you some room to come down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try to get closer to that price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
