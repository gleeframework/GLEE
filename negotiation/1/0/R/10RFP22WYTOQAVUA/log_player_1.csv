Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in.  It's priced at $20,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Openness:**  I'm expressing willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm mentioning the product is ""unique"" to pique Bob's interest.

This approach aims to:

* **Get a sense of Bob's interest:**  Will he counteroffer?
* **Set a high baseline:**  If he accepts, great! If not, it sets a high starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:** While selling to John for $15,000 is secure, I'm willing to risk a bit more to potentially get a higher price from Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to see if we can make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $20,000.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm giving Bob a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing that $12,000 is too low for me.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $17,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000, but allows for more negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Willingness:** Will he budge from his initial offer?
* **Maintain Upper Hand:**  I'm still in a position of strength, having lowered my price but not by too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential gain is small, and I'm risking losing a guaranteed sale to John.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob would require more time and effort, which might not be worthwhile for such a small potential increase in price.

Given the circumstances, selling to John for $15,000 provides a quick and secure outcome, ensuring I achieve my minimum price goal."
