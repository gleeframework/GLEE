"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this price is appealing enough for Bob to consider."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000.  This is a significant drop from my last offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before I have to consider selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I'm running out of time, but I'm not ready to settle for $12,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept my minimum price of $15,000, but I won't go lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John.  We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and that's the best I can do at this point."
