"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 
This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget. This allows for room to bargain without immediately closing the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price. There are still rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This counteroffer represents Bob's final offer. It matches the price he's willing to pay from John, making it a  strong signal that he's serious about buying the product from Alice if she accepts. This also leaves less room for Alice to counteroffer, increasing the pressure on her to accept the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his ideal price point. With only a few rounds left, Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price, hoping to find a deal closer to his desired price."

Round 8

{""product_price"": 13000}
