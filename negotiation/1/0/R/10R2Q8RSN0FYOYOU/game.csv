"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $105. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a high-quality product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $95.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal!",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which is $100. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a high-quality product.",100.0,Alice,5,
