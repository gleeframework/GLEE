"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $150 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $140?  That's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and lets us close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push for a price closer to $150. I have several rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a reasonable compromise, and we can finally finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I still believe I can get a better deal. We've made progress, and I'm confident I can push Bob a bit further. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $125 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy we're getting close, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $118.  Let's close this deal with a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob isn't likely to yield a significantly better price.  He's consistently offering slightly less than my minimum acceptable price, and I've already rejected his last two offers.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
