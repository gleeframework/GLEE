"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the last time I'll be willing to budge, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
