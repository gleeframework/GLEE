"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my last offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.
