"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it's clear we both see the value in this product.  $975,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm confident it's worth more.  Let's settle at $1,010,000.  This is a very competitive offer, and I'm afraid I won't be able to go any lower.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
