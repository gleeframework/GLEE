"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know if that's a price you can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product will continue to be a valuable investment for your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $14,000. If you can meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
