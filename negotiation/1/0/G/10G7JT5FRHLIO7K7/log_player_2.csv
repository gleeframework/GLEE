"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and I'm better off seeing if I can get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low.  It's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than $110, it's still quite a way from my budget and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you value the product at $120, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $85 for this. It's a fair price considering it's worth $120 to me, and it's a great deal for you since it's worth $80 to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm only $5 away from John's offer now.  It's worth one more try to see if I can get it for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle this right now at $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
