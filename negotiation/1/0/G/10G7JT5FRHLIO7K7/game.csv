"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low.  It's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you value the product at $120, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $85 for this. It's a fair price considering it's worth $120 to me, and it's a great deal for you since it's worth $80 to you.  Let's make this happen!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle this right now at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
