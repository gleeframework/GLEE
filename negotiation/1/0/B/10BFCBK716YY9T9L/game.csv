"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $115? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really keen on the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to budge from my original offer of $110. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, though - I'll include a premium accessory that's usually worth $20, absolutely free. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
