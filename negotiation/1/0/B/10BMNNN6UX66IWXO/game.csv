"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $120.  It's the most I can afford at this time. Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is the lowest I can go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",145.0,Alice,7,
