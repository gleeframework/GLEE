"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down to a price closer to Bob's $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $13500? It's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work with you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $13,500 is better than $14,000, it's still above his ideal price of $12,000.  He has a chance to get closer to that target by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  There's still potential for Alice to come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I think that's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
