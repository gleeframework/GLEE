"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $780,000? I'm sure we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $780,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $820,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
