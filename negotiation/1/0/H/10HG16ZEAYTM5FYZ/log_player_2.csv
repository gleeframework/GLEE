"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate further. It's likely Alice is willing to come down a bit more, and I'm confident I can get it closer to my desired $8,000 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,500. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,250 is still too high for my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm not willing to pay that much. At this point, it's more cost-effective to buy the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
