"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $107.50 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $105 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $108. It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.",108.0,Alice,5,
