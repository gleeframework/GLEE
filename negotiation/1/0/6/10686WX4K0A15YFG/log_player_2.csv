"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, so anything above that price is a loss for him. Alice's offer of $180 is too high, so Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me first. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $180 is already a significant discount on what it's worth to me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $150 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $120.  It's better to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiations."
