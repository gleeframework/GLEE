"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  Considering the value to me, I'm offering $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a realistic figure, it's still below my bottom line. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
