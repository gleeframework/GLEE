"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $12,000. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,000?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to lower the price further by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm just a little bit away from accepting.  How about $10,750?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has made a few counteroffers and Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 isn't Bob's ideal price, it's significantly better than his initial offer of $10,000 and is closer to his target of $10,500.  It's also cheaper than buying from John for $15,000.  It's a good compromise, and Bob is better off accepting the offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the product altogether."
