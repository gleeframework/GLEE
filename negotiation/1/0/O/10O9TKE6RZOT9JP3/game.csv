"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $12,000. Let's talk!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,000?  That gives us both a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm just a little bit away from accepting.  How about $10,750?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
