"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:** Starting high establishes a strong initial position and sets the tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my minimum, it allows for potential concessions in future rounds if needed. 
* **Testing Bob's interest:** This first offer will give me a gauge of Bob's seriousness and willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my target:** While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not the optimal outcome.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and continue negotiating.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I prefer to try and get closer to my initial target. Selling to John is a safety net if negotiations with Bob completely break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further from his initial offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  If Bob rejects, I can still lower my price slightly in future rounds, but I don't want to give away too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:**  Accepting now might leave money on the table. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** I want to see if I can get closer to $1,600,000 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant drop:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to close the deal.  
* **Staying above my minimum:**  I am still aiming for a price above my minimum value.
* **Potential for agreement:**  By making a small concession, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to reciprocate and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $1,525,000 is only $75,000 away from my previous offer, and it's significantly closer to my minimum than selling to John.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining,  continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is a safer option than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with no sale at all."
