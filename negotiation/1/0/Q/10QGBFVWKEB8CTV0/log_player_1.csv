Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net.  It's in your best interest to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives Bob the impression that it's valued even higher, potentially exceeding his perceived value of $10,000. This creates room for negotiation and increases your chances of securing a higher price. 
* **""First Refusal"" Tactic:** By framing the offer as a pre-public listing opportunity, you create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, making Bob feel like he's getting a special deal. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your offer and messaging."
