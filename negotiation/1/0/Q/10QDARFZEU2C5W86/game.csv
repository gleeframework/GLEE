"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",160.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $155? It's still a bit above your budget, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality and value.",155.0,Alice,5,
