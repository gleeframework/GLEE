Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000, so anything below that is a loss.
* **John's Offer:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, providing a baseline.
* **Potential Gain:**  By offering $9,000, you're leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob values the product higher, you might get a better deal. 

This approach aims to balance your need for profit with the risk of losing the sale to John."
