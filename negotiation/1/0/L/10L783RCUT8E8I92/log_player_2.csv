"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my minimum price of $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price point ($12,500). While it's closer to my target, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more off the price. I'll reject and counter offer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not ready to give up on the extra $250 yet.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my ideal price point of $12,750, it's close enough that it's worth accepting.  It's significantly less than what I would pay from John, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  I'm confident that I've gotten a good price."
