Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial price. If he's interested, he'll likely counteroffer. If he rejects it outright, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is close to John's offer, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a compromise,  meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe this shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to get more than $800,000, I have to consider that:

1. **Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price.**  I've already stated that I won't sell for less than $800,000. 
2. **We're already in round 4.** The clock is ticking, and I have limited rounds to close the deal. 
3. **John's offer is the same.** There's no guarantee I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.

Therefore, it makes the most sense to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. It's a good price, and it's unlikely I'll get a better one."
