Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially extract a higher price without risking Bob walking away completely.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I can confidently reject it and potentially counter with a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my minimum desired value. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a better price if I counteroffer. 
* **John provides leverage:** Knowing I have John as an alternative buyer gives me confidence to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the potential for negotiation open without significantly jeopardizing my desired outcome. I'm still significantly above Bob's perceived value and can potentially leverage John's offer if Bob rejects. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation, leading to a profitable deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum, but Still Unsatisfactory:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.
* **Risk of Further Reduction:**  If I continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer, potentially forcing me to accept a price far lower than my desired outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and allows me to exit the negotiation with a satisfactory outcome.

**Conclusion:**  Given the potential risks of continued negotiation and the guaranteed profit with John, selling to John is the most rational and advantageous decision at this point."
