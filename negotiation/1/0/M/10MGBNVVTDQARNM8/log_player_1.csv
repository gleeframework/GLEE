Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $80 is a big drop from your initial price, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could try to push for a little more, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **It's more than my minimum:** I'm getting $100, which is a $50 profit over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is not guaranteed:** There's always a chance something could happen with John's offer, and I'd be left with nothing.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already at round 4, and further haggling might not yield significantly better results. 

Accepting $100 now secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
