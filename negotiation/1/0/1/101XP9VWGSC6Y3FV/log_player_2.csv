{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $135, and it's clear she won't budge.  While you could try to haggle further, it's unlikely you'll get a better price from her. John offers the product for $150, and at this point, it's better to secure the product at that price rather than risk losing it entirely by continuing negotiations with Alice."
