Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for a good profit. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
