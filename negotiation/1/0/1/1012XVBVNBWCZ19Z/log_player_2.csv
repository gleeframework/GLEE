"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price:** You're looking to pay no more than $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $10,000. You can try to get a better price.
* **John's price is your fallback:** You have a backup option with John at $15,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** This counteroffer is $2,000 below Alice's initial offer, which is a significant discount. It shows you're serious about buying but also trying to get a better deal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're not offering the minimum you'd pay. This allows for some back-and-forth and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintains a focus on value:** The message emphasizes that you're interested in the product, but the price is the sticking point. 

This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to consider a lower price without immediately resorting to your backup option (John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise, and it's within your budget. 
* **Saving money:** You're getting the product for $1,000 less than John's price.
* **No guarantee of a better offer:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the deal altogether. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money while securing the product within your budget."
