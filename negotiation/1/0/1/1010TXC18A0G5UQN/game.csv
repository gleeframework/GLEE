"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
