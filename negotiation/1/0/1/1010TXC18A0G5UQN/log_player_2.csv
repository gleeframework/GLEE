"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for me. I can do better. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  If that doesn't work, I can always go to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to my desired price, but $1,150,000 is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice has consistently been coming down in price.  At $1,125,000, I'm still getting a good deal compared to John's offer, and it seems unlikely Alice will go any lower.  It's time to accept and move on."
