"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 doesn't cover the true value of this product for me.  To make this work, I'd need to come down to $950,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
