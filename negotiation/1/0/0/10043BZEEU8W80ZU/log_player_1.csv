"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This allows for back and forth to potentially find a price we're both happy with. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the high value I place on the product to give Bob a sense of its worth. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my $1,200,000 floor as possible without losing the deal to John. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he acknowledges the product's value. This suggests that further negotiation is possible. 
* **Selling to John is a good backup:**  Selling to John would guarantee my desired profit, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 doesn't cover the true value of this product for me.  To make this work, I'd need to come down to $950,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still leaves a significant margin for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that even at $950,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for future negotiation:**  This price leaves room for one or two more rounds of negotiation before I need to consider selling to John.

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to find a price that both Bob and I are comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go down further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for future negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a significant profit and still leaves open the possibility of future negotiations with Bob for additional benefits or services.
* **Risk of losing to John:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a lower profit. 

**Strategy:** 

By accepting this offer, I secure a profitable sale while keeping the door open for potential future collaborations with Bob."
