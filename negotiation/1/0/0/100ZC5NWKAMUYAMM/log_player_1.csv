Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my minimum price point. This way, if Bob doesn't accept, I can immediately turn to John and get my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but not too much. $11,000 is still a decent price for me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is close to my minimum price point of $12,000 and is the best I've gotten so far. It's a bit of a compromise, but I'd rather secure the sale with Bob than risk losing him and having to deal with John, who might not be as easy to work with."
