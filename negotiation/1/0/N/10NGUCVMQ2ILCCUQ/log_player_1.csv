Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he has a clear incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the value I know the product holds for Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $900,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I believe this price is fair considering Bob's known valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired price point. I will counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap and reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $890,000. This shows further flexibility and demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement with Bob. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offers and my own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal considering the negotiation history. Bob has shown a willingness to pay close to my desired price point, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of a potential stalemate or a lower offer from John."
