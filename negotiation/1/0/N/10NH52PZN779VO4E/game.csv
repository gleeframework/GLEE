"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price that's still attractive to both of us. I'm asking for $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a significant discount from what the product is worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair considering its value to you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 is still not workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,275,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this point.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
