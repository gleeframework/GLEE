"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $760,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
