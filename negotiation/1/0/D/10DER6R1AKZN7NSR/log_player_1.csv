Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $85 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
