Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price makes the offer seem more appealing to Bob."
