"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're really serious about getting the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8250.0,Alice,5,
