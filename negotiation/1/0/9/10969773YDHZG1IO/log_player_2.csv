"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,500 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a price closer to his $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range given his budget. This initial counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness about acquiring the product while also demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  By offering $10,500, Bob is leaving some room for compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a better deal than her previous offer, there's still room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the possibility of reaching a more favorable price.  He can counter-offer again, trying to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price within his budget. Offering $11,000 shows Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a little more than his ideal price, but he's still not willing to pay Alice's full asking price.  This move puts pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still above his ideal price.  At this point, with limited rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a price higher than $10,000 becomes too high.  

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget. It's a safer choice, ensuring he gets the product within his financial limits and avoids the possibility of overpaying in the remaining rounds."
