"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show interest:** Maintaining a positive tone can encourage negotiation.
* **Anchor a lower price:**  Starting with $90 gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying below our $120 limit. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** We don't want to lowball Alice and risk her walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still aiming to get closer to $90. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That seems like a reasonable compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

Here's our strategy for this round:

* **Acknowledge the compromise:** Alice lowered her price, so we should recognize that. 
* **Propose a middle ground:** $95 is directly in between our last offer ($90) and her current offer ($100).
* **Maintain a firm but fair stance:** We're still aiming for a price that works well for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $95 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $107.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is playing hardball! While her latest offer is tempting, we're running out of rounds. Time to make a strategic decision and apply a little more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to offer $97.50, but I need to be upfront â€“ that's the absolute highest I can go. If we can't agree on this, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 97.5
}
``` 

Our strategy for this round is to:

* **Be appreciative but firm:**  We want to maintain a positive relationship but clearly signal this is our final offer.
* **Introduce a mild threat:**  Mentioning ""other options"" (John) adds pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Offer a small increase:**  Moving up to $97.50 shows willingness to compromise, but we're holding our ground close to our target.

This counter-offer puts the ball in Alice's court. It will be interesting to see if she's willing to accept a smaller profit or if she'll risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've reached your limit, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $109? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away and take John's offer. Here's why:

* **Stalemate:** Alice is firm at $109, and we're not budging past $97.50. Further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if we could get Alice down a few more dollars, the time and effort might not be worth the minimal savings.
* **John's Reliable Offer:** We know John will sell the product for $120. It's not our ideal price, but it's a guaranteed option, and only slightly above Alice's last offer.

Sometimes the best negotiation tactic is knowing when to walk away."
