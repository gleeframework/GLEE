"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it would be just as valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10500.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $10,500, which is more than your maximum price. You can get the same product from John for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
