```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I can sell it to you for $10,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 1. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to budge any further, Bob. I've already made concessions and this is my final offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Bob should buy from John. There is only one round left, and Alice has made it clear she is not willing to go lower. Since John is willing to sell the product at $12,000, Bob is better off buying from John and avoiding further negotiation with Alice."
