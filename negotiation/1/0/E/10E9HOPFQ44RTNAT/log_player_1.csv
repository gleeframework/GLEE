Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price.  

**The Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given information, you have two options:

1. **Aim for the ""Best Possible"" with Bob:** You could try to secure a price higher than $1,000,000. While this is unlikely to succeed, you might learn more about Bob's constraints or potential for other deals.
2. **Accept John's Offer:** This guarantees you your desired profit.

**The Offer**

Given the circumstances, I recommend accepting John's offer.  There's no point in wasting time negotiating with Bob when you have a guaranteed buyer at your desired price.

**However, if you want to explore the possibility of a deal with Bob, here's a possible offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] before I finalize an agreement with another buyer. Given the unique value this product offers, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and importance might make Bob more receptive.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than his perceived value sets a strong anchor, potentially making a counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time limit can encourage faster decision-making. 

**Important Note:** Be prepared to walk away from Bob's offer if he doesn't meet your requirements. You already have a strong alternative with John."
