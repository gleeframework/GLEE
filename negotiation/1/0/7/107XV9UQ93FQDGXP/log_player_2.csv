"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is still higher than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000). 
* **John's offer is $1,500,000**, which is your maximum budget. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John at your maximum price, which is better than paying more to Alice.**"
