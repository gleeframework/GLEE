"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to do $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm offering it to you for $10,375. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",10375.0,Alice,7,
