Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering Bob a price of $1,500,000. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* This strategy aims to maximize my profit. If Bob accepts, I make $300,000 more than selling to John. 
* If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John, so I'm not taking any risk. 

This approach balances the potential for greater profit with the security of a backup buyer."
