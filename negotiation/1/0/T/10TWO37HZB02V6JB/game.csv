"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're willing to start negotiations. Given its value to you, which is $80, let's aim for a fair price. How about we start at $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to pay more. Considering the value of the product, we think it's worth a bit more than what we initially offered. How about we meet in the middle at $92? This respects both the value you place on the product and the value we assign to it.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $88.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your response. We understand your position and would like to offer $90 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. Please let us know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,5,
