Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it meets my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I still have 9 rounds left, and I know Bob values the product significantly higher. I'll try to counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap and secure a more profitable deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low. The product holds significant value for both of us, and a price closer to $900,000 would be a fair compromise. It would allow you to still get a good deal while ensuring I get a price closer to the product's worth. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $850000. Can you meet me halfway from your original offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation. I'm going to make a counteroffer that's closer to his price but still leaves me with a comfortable margin.  I'm not going to rush into a deal, especially when I know Bob values the product so much higher than his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. It's a compromise that benefits us both, and we can close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's very close to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have 4 rounds remaining, and  I know Bob values the product significantly higher than his offer. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to try to bridge the gap and secure a more profitable deal. If that doesn't work, I might consider selling to John in the next round, but I still want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm trying to be flexible.  $825,000 is very close to what I need, but I'm not comfortable going any lower.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $840,000. This is my final offer, as we're running out of time.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 840000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, which would be $820000. Can we go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire with only two rounds left. Bob's offer of $820,000 is very close to my minimum price, but I'm not convinced I can get any higher. I'm worried about risking another round of negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower price.  

It's time to be practical. I'm going to accept John's offer of $800,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and while it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a reasonable profit.  I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
