"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me halfway?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low. The product holds significant value for both of us, and a price closer to $900000 would be a fair compromise. It would allow you to still get a good deal while ensuring I get a price closer to the product's worth. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's split the difference and go with $875000. It's a compromise that benefits us both, and we can close this deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm trying to be flexible.  $825000 is very close to what I need, but I'm not comfortable going any lower.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $840000. This is my final offer, as we're running out of time.  Let's close this deal.",840000.0,Alice,7,
