"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering $1,500,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
