"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It is a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, we are offering it to you for $1300000. We believe this price reflects the quality and potential impact of the product, while also providing a fair margin for us. We look forward to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than his target of $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product. While I see its potential, my budget for this investment is $1,200,000.
