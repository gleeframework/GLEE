"Thanks Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $13,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
