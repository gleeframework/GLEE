"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate further, $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
