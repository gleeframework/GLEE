"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
