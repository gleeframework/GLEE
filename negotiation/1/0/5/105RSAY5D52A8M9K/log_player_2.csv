"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth your while to consider this offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $750,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob doesn't know the product's value to Alice, the offer is still a good deal for him."
