"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let go of the product for $1,350,000. This takes into account the significant value it brings to your operations.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
