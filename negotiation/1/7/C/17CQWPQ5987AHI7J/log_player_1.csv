Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous.
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still netting Alice a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
