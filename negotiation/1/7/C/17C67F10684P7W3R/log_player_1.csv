{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This offer gives Bob a chance to accept and saves me the time of going back and forth with counteroffers. 
*  If Bob rejects, I can use this initial offer to gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. 
*  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. 
* I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,500** is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* The message acknowledges Bob's offer and explains why it's not acceptable. 
* It also offers a counterproposal that is more in line with my desired outcome, while still being open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $11,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still not profitable enough for me. 
* I will reject his offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can get a better price from Bob, or I can always sell to John for $15,000."
