"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can do $95, but that's as close as I can get to your price. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
