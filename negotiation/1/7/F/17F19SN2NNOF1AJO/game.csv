"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true worth and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, my budget still doesn't allow for $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Bob,4,
