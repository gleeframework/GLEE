Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. In light of your proposal, I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives Bob a chance to get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $890,000 for our product. This figure strikes a balance between the value of the product and your budgetary considerations. I hope this offer is acceptable and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is a good compromise. It's still a considerable saving for Bob compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000. However, considering the potential for more negotiation to be time-consuming and uncertain, accepting the current offer is a strategic decision that secures a good deal and avoids unnecessary delays."
