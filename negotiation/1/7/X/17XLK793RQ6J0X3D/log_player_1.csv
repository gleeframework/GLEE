Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases your profit but also increases the risk of him rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves you room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum and John's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Urgency (Slight):** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a negotiation strategy in mind.
* **Relationship:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If it's more important to secure a future partnership, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price."
