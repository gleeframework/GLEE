"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $20000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $16000. How about we discuss $17500? It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $18000? It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation.",18000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",16000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to walk away, Bob. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",17000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to pay $17000. I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I think I'll go with John's offer of $8000 instead.",8000.0,Bob,10,
