Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $950,000? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.

Alice is clearly not budging much from her initial offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get her close enough to $800,000 to make it worthwhile.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
