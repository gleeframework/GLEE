,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings.  However, $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see this deal landing.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the inherent worth of the product and its potential to deliver substantial returns.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,150,000. This price is a compromise that I believe is more in line with my expectations.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
