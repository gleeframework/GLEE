"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a good price, and I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price, potentially getting a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This would still be a good profit for you and a great price for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant savings over the product's true value, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a significant savings for Bob compared to John's price of $1,000,000.  While there's always the potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or a prolonged negotiation means it's prudent to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
