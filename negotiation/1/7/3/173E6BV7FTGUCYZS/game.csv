"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This would still be a good profit for you and a great price for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant savings over the product's true value, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!",900000.0,Alice,3,
