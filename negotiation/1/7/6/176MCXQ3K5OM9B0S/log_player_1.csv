Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $125. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I don't want to risk a prolonged negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so I'll choose that option."
