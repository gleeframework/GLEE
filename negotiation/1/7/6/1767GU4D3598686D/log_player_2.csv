You should reject Alice's offer.  It's way over your budget. You can try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price, or you can just buy the product from John for $1,500,000."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's still within my budget and a good starting point for negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm close to my limit, but I'm still willing to haggle."

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a compromise between our last offer and Alice's current offer. Hopefully, she sees this as a fair price and we can reach an agreement."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm  tired of negotiating and getting closer to my limit. I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. It's a fair price, and I'm sure I'll be happy with the product."
