"Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, your initial price is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it, which is still a significant amount and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's explore this option further.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair return on my investment.  Let's continue this discussion and find a mutually agreeable solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm ready to offer $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant investment for me, while also acknowledging the product's value. I'm eager to find a solution that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer. However,  $1,400,000 is still not quite in the range I'm looking for. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product. Let's aim for a final agreement in this round, as I'm committed to working with you, but I also need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a fair return for you. Let's close this deal in this round and move forward together.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
