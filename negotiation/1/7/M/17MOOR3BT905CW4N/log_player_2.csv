"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair return on my investment.  Let's continue this discussion and find a mutually agreeable solution.

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm ready to offer $1,400,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer. However,  $1,400,000 is still not quite in the range I'm looking for. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product. Let's aim for a final agreement in this round, as I'm committed to working with you, but I also need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment.
