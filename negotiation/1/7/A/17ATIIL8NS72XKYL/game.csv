"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, like $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $75 is getting a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $85? It's still a great price for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
