"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it at $135.  It's reasonable to try to negotiate a lower price.  We have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer and trying to get a better price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer of $125, which is still above Alice's value but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate further while still being a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $140 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further since we have rounds left and her previous rejection shows she is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

We're increasing our counteroffer to $130.  This shows we're willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer. We're hoping this will be a more attractive offer for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is sticking to a price higher than our target. We still have rounds left and her previous rejection shows she's open to negotiations. Rejecting the offer and continuing to counteroffer is our best strategy to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

We're sticking to a price slightly higher than our last offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows we're serious about getting a deal, but we're not willing to give in entirely. We're hoping this will finally get Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $150 is the same as John's price.  We've already tried negotiating with Alice and haven't been able to get a lower price. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
