Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer.  However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $1,075,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, and I'm offering $1,090,000.  This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll get from this product.  I believe this is a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,090,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,090,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a bit more of a compromise.  I'm willing to go to $1,080,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us to both move forward."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,080,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,085,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that acknowledges the value of this product for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,085,000, which is just a bit higher than my last counteroffer.  It's a good deal for me considering John is asking for $1,200,000. At this point, it's probably better to accept and finalize the purchase.  It's possible I could negotiate a bit lower, but there's a risk she'll walk away, and then I'll be stuck paying John's higher price."
