Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is a bold move, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation. I'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, but I'm still not satisfied. I want to push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. I think this price is fair, considering Bob's initial offer and the fact that I have a backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable number. It's important to remember that I have a solid backup offer from John, so I don't need to rush into accepting a price that doesn't satisfy me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible while still trying to earn a decent profit. I believe there's still room for negotiation, but I'm also aware that John is waiting in the wings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  While I'd love to make more, I'm happy to accept John's offer and get a good price for my product.  It's time to move on and secure a deal that meets my financial goals."
