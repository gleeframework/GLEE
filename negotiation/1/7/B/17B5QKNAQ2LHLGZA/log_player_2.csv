"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,150,000 is already a very competitive offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This reflects my best effort to find a middle ground.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."

This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe this product is worth more, I value closing this deal. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While it's lower than her original asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially going back and forth for many more rounds, Bob should choose to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures he gets the product at the best possible price within his budget."
