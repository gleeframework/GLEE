Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have a strong position to aim high. 
* **Value Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the product's ""value and potential"" aim to justify the higher price.
* **Urgency and Competition:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This offer assumes Bob sees a significant potential return on investment above $1,200,000. If the product's value to Bob is capped at $800,000, this offer is unlikely to succeed.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price will be crucial in any counter-offers."
