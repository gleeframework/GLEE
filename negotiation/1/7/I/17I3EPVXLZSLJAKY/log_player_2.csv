"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1,300,000.  This price reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the value it brings to your business.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Here's my message:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000.

Can you meet me at this price or is there some flexibility you can offer?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,200,000. This price still represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to go a bit further to close this deal.  $1,150,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  This price would allow me to move forward while still giving you a great deal on the product.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I think we can do better than that.
