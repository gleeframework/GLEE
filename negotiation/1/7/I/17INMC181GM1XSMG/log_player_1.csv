"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. It also demonstrates that you are confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. You have 9 rounds left, and there's potential to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a good portion of your desired profit margin.  It also shows Bob that you're serious about reaching a deal, but not desperate to sell for his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While selling to John is an option, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer is still the best strategy at this point. Bob's offer is too low, and you have more rounds to reach a better price. You're still within your acceptable range with John as a backup, which allows you to be more aggressive with Bob and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

You're starting to get closer to John's offer. This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to come down but you still believe the product is worth more.  It's a strong position to be in, and you're still leaving room for a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of reaching a deal is becoming increasingly uncertain. While $1,000,000 from John is your minimum acceptable price, it's a guaranteed profit at this point. Selling to John guarantees you a secure sale and allows you to avoid further negotiation with Bob, who might not reach your acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
