"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115? This is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $105? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",105.0,Bob,4,
