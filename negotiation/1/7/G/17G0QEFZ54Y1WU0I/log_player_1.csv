"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Expressing openness:**  Mentioning that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Highlighting value:**  While I haven't explicitly stated the product's value to me, I'm implying it's valuable by suggesting Bob would appreciate it.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while setting a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 

I will now proceed to the next round and counter-offer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  $95 is still above my minimum ($100) but closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  Mentioning ""fair price for both of us"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and cooperation.
* **Positive tone:** Using ""appreciate"" and ""willing"" maintains a positive atmosphere for continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $92.5 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's very close.
* **Time pressure:**  As we progress through rounds, the pressure to close the deal increases. Selling to John for $100 is always an option, but accepting Bob's offer would be a quicker and more profitable outcome in this round.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm completely giving up on getting closer to my initial price. If Bob is happy with this price, I may be able to negotiate further in future rounds. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a good deal while leaving room for potential improvement in future rounds."
