"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price significantly closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""potential value for [Bob's] business,"" we are framing the price as an investment, not just a cost.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  We avoid being overly aggressive and signal that we're open to negotiation with phrases like ""initial offer"" and ""proposing."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to our minimum, but it's still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We're early in the negotiation and have room to counter.  We'll aim to guide him closer to our desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings, especially to your specific operations, is substantial. Let's find a middle ground - I'm proposing $1,360,000."", ""product_price"": 1360000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer ($60,000), showing flexibility. However, we're still holding firm above the halfway point between our starting point ($1,400,000) and his offer ($1,300,000).
* **Reiterating Value:** We are subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique value proposition tailored to his needs (""especially to your specific operations"").  This helps justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The phrase ""Let's find a middle ground"" encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation, rather than an adversarial one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,320,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically using the ""meet halfway"" tactic, but he's basing it on our conceded offer ($1,360,000), not the true middle ground between our initial positions.  We are still significantly above our minimum and have time to negotiate further.  The risk of losing the deal at this stage is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this deal. How about we settle at $1,340,000?  That's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while recognizing your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We are reducing our concession size to $20,000, signaling we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Finding Compromise:** We explicitly use the word ""compromise"" and acknowledge both sides' perspectives to create a sense of fairness.
* **Justification:** We're again lightly anchoring the price to ""the product's worth"" while acknowledging his ""budget constraints"" to create a more persuasive argument.
* **Time Consideration:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. This offer aims to strike a deal soon while still maximizing our profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,330,000, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the market value of the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is still a very profitable deal for us. It's $130,000 above our minimum selling price to John.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The concessions from Bob are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll get much higher than this without risking the entire deal.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further increases the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a significant profit. 

While we could push for a bit more, the potential upside is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept and secure the profit."
