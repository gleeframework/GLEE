"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer you a great deal on it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there is still room for further negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get the price down even lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would give you a decent profit while still being a good deal for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $11,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $11,200 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get the price closer to his target of $10,500 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,750? It's a good compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer you the product for $11,300. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price but has only a few rounds left.  Alice's offer of $11,300 is close enough to his target of $10,500 that it's worth accepting.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John for a significantly higher price.  It's a calculated risk to accept and secure the product at a good price."
