Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves a good buffer between your asking price and both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and negotiating style.  His response will give you valuable information for your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. You have the option to counter and potentially secure a higher price, moving closer to your initial ask of $1,300,000. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be leaving money on the table at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept right now. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This classic negotiating tactic often feels fair to both parties. It signals a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By countering at $1,250,000, you're holding firm on a price significantly above your minimum. You're communicating that the product is valuable and you're not desperate to sell at any cost.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's still potential for Bob to negotiate further, offering you a final opportunity to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $1,250,000, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you could continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant profit above your minimum of $1,000,000.  Here's why it makes sense to accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental increases at this point.  The time and effort involved might not be worth the potential gain.
* **Strong Offer:** $1,150,000 is a very good offer, and pushing Bob too hard could risk him walking away from the deal entirely. 
* **Certainty:**  Accepting now guarantees the sale and provides immediate profit."
