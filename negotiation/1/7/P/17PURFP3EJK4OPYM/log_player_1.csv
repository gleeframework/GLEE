I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better price, and I have more rounds to try."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price, and I'm not quite ready to accept John's offer yet.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  We're at the halfway point in our negotiations with Bob, and it's clear he's not going to come up to my desired price.  I've already missed my chance to sell to John for a higher amount, and I don't want to risk missing out on that sale entirely."
