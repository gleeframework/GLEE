Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a competitive price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents excellent value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still leaving some room for you to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still holding firm at $1,050,000, but I'm not ready to give up yet.  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can persuade Bob to come up a bit higher.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000.  This represents a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's the closest I can come at this point.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a very good deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly sticking to his $1,050,000 offer. With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of him increasing his offer to something closer to my desired price is low.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a deal below my minimum is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
