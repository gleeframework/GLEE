"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still leaving some room for you to make a profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000.  This represents a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's the closest I can come at this point.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a very good deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
