"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds immense value to me and I believe it would be equally beneficial for you, given its worth of $8,000 to you. Considering its unique features and the benefits it offers, I am extending this offer to you at a special price of $10,000. I am confident that this investment will provide you with significant returns and meet your needs perfectly. I look forward to hearing your response soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims the product is worth $8,000 to me, I know I can get it for $8,000 from John.  Her offer of $10,000 is not in my best interest."
