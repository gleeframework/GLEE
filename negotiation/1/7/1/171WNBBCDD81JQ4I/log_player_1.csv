Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, but it is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident this will initiate a conversation with Bob while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm still confident I can secure a higher price than Bob's offer. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal."
