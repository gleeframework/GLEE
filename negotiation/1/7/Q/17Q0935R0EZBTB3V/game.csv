"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to you and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
