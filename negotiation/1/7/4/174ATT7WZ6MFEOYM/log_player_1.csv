{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer that is too low.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  This shows that you're confident in the product's value. 

Remember, you can always counter Bob's offers, and if negotiations stall, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm not willing to accept his initial price.
* **Lower than my previous offer:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum acceptable price:** I'm still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $8500. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  I'm still not willing to accept his price.
* **Lower than my previous offer:** Shows I'm committed to finding a compromise.
* **Closer to my minimum acceptable price:** I'm getting closer to my goal. 

I'm hoping this offer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $8800, but that's as high as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is getting frustratingly close to my minimum acceptable price. To avoid further negotiation and potential deadlock, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed deal and ensures I meet my financial goals."
