"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1 million to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
