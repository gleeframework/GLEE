It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. $120 is still too high for Bob, as he's only willing to pay $80."

While $100 is closer to Bob's target, it's still more than he's willing to pay. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, and if not, Bob can still buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go below $95. While $95 is closer to Bob's target, it is still above his limit of $80. To save money, it is best for Bob to buy the product from John for $80."
