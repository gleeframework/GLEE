"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a high-quality item that's worth more than its value to you. Don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal since it's below your $80 maximum and saves you money. There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Alice through further negotiation."
