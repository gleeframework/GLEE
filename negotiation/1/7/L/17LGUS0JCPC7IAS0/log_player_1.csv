Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive but still profitable for her.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$12,000 or higher:** Bob is highly likely to reject this offer since it's more than he values the product.
* **$8,000 - $10,000:**  While this range might seem tempting to ensure a sale, it leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table for Alice."
