"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation space and sets a high baseline. I believe the product is worth more than $800,000, and I'm hoping Bob sees its potential value as well.  I'll be watching his reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but that offer is far below the value I know the product holds. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm dropping my offer to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident the product is worth this amount. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my offer and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$700,000 is still not enough for me.  While I am starting to feel the pressure of time, I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.  I'll see if Bob is willing to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to $850,000. This is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will agree. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where time is becoming a factor, and I'm not confident that I can get a better deal from Bob. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $800,000 from John is a guaranteed sale and a good outcome. I'm going to sell to John."
