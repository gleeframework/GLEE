"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,900. Can you consider this price?",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,900 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
