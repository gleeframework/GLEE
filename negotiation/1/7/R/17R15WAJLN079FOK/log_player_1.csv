Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's counteroffer of $100. Hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept while still allowing me to get a good price for the product."
