Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still within your budget and significantly lower than John's price of $150. It's likely you won't get a better deal from Alice, so accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous option."
