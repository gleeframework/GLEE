"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it meets your needs perfectly. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a little more than I'd like to spend.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the same price John is offering, so I have to consider that as well.",10000.0,Alice,5,
