Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, I'm not quite ready to accept $1400000.  Given the unique value and potential of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer and still allows for a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.
