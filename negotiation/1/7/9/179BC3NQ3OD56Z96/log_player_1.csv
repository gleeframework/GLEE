Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will prove to be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to be ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** Aiming high emphasizes the product's value. While $1,500,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, it opens the door for negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives you space to potentially negotiate downwards while still securing a profit beyond your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves the risk that Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk, given your backup buyer."
