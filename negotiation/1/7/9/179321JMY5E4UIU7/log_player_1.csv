"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob.  I want to leave room for negotiation but also maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for that low, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks again for your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my initial asking price. I think this could be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now and we're not making much progress. I'm starting to run out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale with John.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
