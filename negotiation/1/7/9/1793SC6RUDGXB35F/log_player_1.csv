"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a good starting point, high enough to potentially maximize my profit, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away.  I'll see how he reacts before adjusting my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  $92 is tempting, but I feel like I can get closer to my desired price with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 94}
```

I'm going to counter with $94.  It's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not giving in too easily.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal done this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're running out of rounds, and $91 is still a good profit.  There's a risk I could get a better deal later, but also a risk I might not get any deal at all.  It's time to take the sure thing."
