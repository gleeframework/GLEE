"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $96?",96.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $96 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
