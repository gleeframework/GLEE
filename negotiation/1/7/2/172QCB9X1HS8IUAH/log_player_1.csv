Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm confident it's worth $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully sold the product!
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below the $15,000 I'd get from John.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room to negotiate with Bob further and potentially get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, but still within a range that might be appealing to him. I'll need to balance the potential for a better deal with the risk of losing Bob entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've secured a good deal while maintaining my minimum profit margin.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll need to assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If his counteroffers keep falling below my minimum, I'll move on to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Bob:**  If I continue to reject Bob's offers, there's a good chance he'll walk away, leaving me with the option of selling to John.  
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation might take longer and there's no guarantee of a better offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. I've secured a decent profit and avoided the risk of losing him entirely."
