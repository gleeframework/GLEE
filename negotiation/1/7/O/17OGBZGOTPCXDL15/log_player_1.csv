Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $990,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.

It's getting close to the wire, and while I'd like to push for more, Bob is clearly committed to a price point in this range. Accepting his offer of $990,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum."
