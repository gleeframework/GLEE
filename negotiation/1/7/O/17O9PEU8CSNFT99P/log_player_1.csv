"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is my opening offer.  I'm starting high, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high, but I'm still interested in purchasing it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I think is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  There's still room for a better price, and I don't want to rush into a deal that leaves me underselling the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $935,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 935000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's only slightly above Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but also leaving room for some negotiation if needed.  I'm hopeful this will close the deal and avoid needing to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of reaching a deal below my ideal price is getting too high. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
