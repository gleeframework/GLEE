Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $800000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of revising my offer to $1200000, which is my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm happy to make the sale. However, if not, I'm open to further negotiations.

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm thinking of revising my offer to $1100000.
