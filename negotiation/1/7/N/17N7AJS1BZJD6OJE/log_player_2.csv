"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I would like to reject the offer. The product is worth $120 to me, so I don't think $125 is a good deal. I'll consider buying it from John instead.
