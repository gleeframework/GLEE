"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible opportunity. This product is a unique and valuable asset that I'm confident you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1200000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit low for my comfort level. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $975000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $975000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. My counteroffer is $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $995000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",995000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $995000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $995000, Alice, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you accept that?",995000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any higher than $995000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've made several concessions already, and I need to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $1050000, but I'm willing to do one more thing to sweeten the deal - I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $25000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional services, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1050000. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $995000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000.",995000.0,Bob,10,
