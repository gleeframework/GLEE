Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer below that is unacceptable.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to gauge Bob's interest.  A price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit above your minimum.

**Strategy:**

This offer starts the negotiation with a strong position. It's possible Bob will accept outright. If not, it opens the door for counter-offers, and you can gradually decrease the price, always keeping your $800,000 safety net in mind."
