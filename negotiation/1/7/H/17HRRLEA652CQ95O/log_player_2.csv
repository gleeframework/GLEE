"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** The product is worth $80 to Alice and she's asking for $95.  This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's better to try and get a lower price.**  By rejecting the offer, I can try to get a better deal from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If I can't get a good price from Alice, I can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is lower than Alice's offer:** I'm offering $85, which is lower than her asking price of $95. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but want a better price.
* **Offer is within my budget:** $85 is still within my budget of $100, so it's a reasonable counteroffer.
* **Message is polite and open to negotiation:**  The message expresses interest in the product while also indicating my willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $90 is still above what the product is worth to her ($80) and leaves little room for me to profit.
* **There's still potential for a better price.** I can continue to negotiate and see if I can get Alice to come down further.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  However, I want to exhaust all options with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer:**  I'm increasing my offer to $87, which is closer to Alice's offer of $90, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Offer is still within my budget:**  $87 is still within my budget of $100, so it's a reasonable offer.
* **Message is polite and emphasizes finding a middle ground:**  This encourages Alice to see the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I'm willing to come down to $89. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to my target price:**  $89 is only $2 away from my ideal price of $87.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's risky to continue haggling. There's a chance I might not get a better price, and I could end up buying from John for a higher price.
* **Accepting this offer is a good compromise:**  While not my ideal price, it's a fair deal that allows me to buy the product within my budget and save money compared to buying from John."
