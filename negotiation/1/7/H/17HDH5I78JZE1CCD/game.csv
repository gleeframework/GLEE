"I'm very interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $920000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $880000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $880000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you a price of $900000, which is the same as my initial offer, minus a small discount. I believe this is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not willing to go above $880000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $880000 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to pay any more than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $880000?",880000.0,Bob,6,
