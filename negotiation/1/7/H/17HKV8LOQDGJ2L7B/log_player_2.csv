# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the sale of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range. To be honest, $1,125,000 is the absolute highest I could go. It's a fair offer that keeps us both  moving forward.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,125,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My next offer is $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, so let me know if you're willing to meet me here or if we need to part ways. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,250,000.  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John with no further negotiation. It makes the most sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
