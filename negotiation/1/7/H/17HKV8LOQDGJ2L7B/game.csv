"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the sale of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range. To be honest, $1,125,000 is the absolute highest I could go. It's a fair offer that keeps us both  moving forward.  Let me know if that works for you.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,125,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My next offer is $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, so let me know if you're willing to meet me here or if we need to part ways.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
