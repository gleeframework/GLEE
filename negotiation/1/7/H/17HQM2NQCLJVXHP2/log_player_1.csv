"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price of $130, knowing it's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm above my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still a good price for Bob since he's willing to pay $110, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is now pushing for a price below my minimum. While it's tempting to take the $105, I'm going to hold out and see if I can get closer to my target.  I still have rounds left and John is a reliable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since Bob is willing to pay $105, there's room for a compromise, and this offer ensures I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and we are running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120. While it's not ideal, it guarantees I at least break even and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
