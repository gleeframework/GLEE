"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be ready to adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I will reject and counteroffer to get closer to my desired price.  While $1,500,000 is a good fallback with John, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation, and is closer to my desired profit. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower. While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm still determined to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price point. This counteroffer is only $50,000 less than what I could get from John.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I've already made significant concessions and it's clear he's not willing to meet me halfway.  I'm happy to accept John's offer and secure a profitable deal with a buyer who is willing to pay a fair price."
