Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point that allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer and significantly better than selling to John. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price."
