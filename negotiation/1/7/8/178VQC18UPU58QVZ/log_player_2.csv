"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000 since it's worth $8,000 to Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by aiming for a significant discount, offering a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. This allows for room for negotiation and incentivizes Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $10,000, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $15,000. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially ending up paying John's higher price outweighs the potential benefit of saving a few more dollars."
