"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your $100 maximum and leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.** This gives you the chance to lower the price and potentially get a better deal.
* **John's offer is a backup.**  You can always buy from John, so you're not pressured to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $90 is still a bit more than you'd like, but it's less than John's price.
* **It's likely the best you'll get.**  Alice has already lowered her price from $95 to $90, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Time is a factor.** Further negotiation could take longer, and John's offer is always available as a fallback."
