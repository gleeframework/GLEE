"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and this price gives you a good opportunity to secure it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject the offer. I can get the product for $12,000 from John, so paying $15,000 to Alice is not a good deal for me.
