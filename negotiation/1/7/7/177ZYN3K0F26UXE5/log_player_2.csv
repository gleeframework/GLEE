"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $8,000. Let's discuss if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to immediately buy from John when there's a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the product, but $8,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant but reasonable counteroffer:** Bob is starting with a significant discount, but not an unreasonable one. A $500 reduction is a good starting point to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay within Bob's budget:**  The offer is still within Bob's budget, giving him room to potentially compromise.
* **Be polite and direct:** The message is clear and polite, establishing a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and the current market conditions, we propose a price of $7,800 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $7,800 is still within Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Significant progress made:**  Alice has already lowered the price by $200 from her initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and possibly ending up buying from John at $8,000 is too high.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product."
