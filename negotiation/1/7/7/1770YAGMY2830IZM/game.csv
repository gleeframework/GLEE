,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, but I think I can do even better than that. How about $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $9,800 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200, but I don't think there's much room for further compromise.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,800, but I think $9,600 is a fair price for this product. Can you consider it?",9600.0,Bob,6,
