"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob. Alice's initial offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum price.  There's potential to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's offer was significantly lower than Bob's maximum price, a counteroffer of $400,000 is a good starting point. It's still a substantial discount from Bob's maximum, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come up from her initial offer and is now closer to Bob's counteroffer. Accepting the offer at $450,000 saves Bob $350,000 compared to buying from John. While there's still some room for negotiation, accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids potentially getting stuck with a higher price later."
