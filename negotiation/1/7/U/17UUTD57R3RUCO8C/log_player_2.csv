"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between Alice's offer and my maximum willingness to pay.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come up from her initial offer, and $8,500 is a good price, saving me a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
