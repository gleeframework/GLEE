Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price without risking losing Bob to a counteroffer or having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I need to try and push for a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but it is a compromise. I am willing to go lower than my previous offer, but I am not willing to go as low as Bob's offer. I hope that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, but I am prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum value, it's still not where I want it to be.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping to squeeze a little more out of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to try a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above his last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
