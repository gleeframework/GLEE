"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this deal happen.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $155? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
