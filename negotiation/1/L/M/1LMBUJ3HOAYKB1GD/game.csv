"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $15500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
