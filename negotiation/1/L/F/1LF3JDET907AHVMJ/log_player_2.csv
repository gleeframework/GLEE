# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
