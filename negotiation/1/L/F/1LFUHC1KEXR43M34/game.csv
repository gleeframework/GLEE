,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  It's a fair price for a valuable product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
