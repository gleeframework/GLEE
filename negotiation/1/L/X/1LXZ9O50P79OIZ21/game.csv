"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for $950,000, but I'm still only comfortable with $875,000. This price is closer to my initial offer, and it's a fair compromise given the value I place on the product. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not willing to go much higher. ",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on $925,000, but that's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.  It's the absolute highest I'm able to go. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,6,
