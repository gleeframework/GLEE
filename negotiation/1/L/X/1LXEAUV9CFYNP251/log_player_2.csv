"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price of $80. It's always beneficial to accept an offer that's within your budget, especially in the first round. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
