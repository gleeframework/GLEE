"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $1,300,000 just isn't going to cut it. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
