Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging to get Bob interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows good faith and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will be fruitful.  I'm going to accept the offer from John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.  It's a sure thing, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
