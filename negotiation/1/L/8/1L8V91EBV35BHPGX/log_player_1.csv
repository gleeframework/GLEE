"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room for negotiation.  I believe I can secure a higher price, especially since I'm aware of the product's value to him.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,250,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get a higher price, considering the product's value to him.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation process going and allows me to see if he's willing to come up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?  That's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in Round 6, and the negotiation has gone on for a while.  Bob has shown some willingness to go higher, but he's clearly holding firm at his offer of $1,275,000.  

* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he'll get even more stubborn and the price might drop even lower.
* **Value of the deal:** While I would ideally get closer to my initial target price, $1,275,000 is still a good deal and well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

Given the time constraint and the possibility of a less favorable outcome, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point.  It secures a good price and closes the deal."
