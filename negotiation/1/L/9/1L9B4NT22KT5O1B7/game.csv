"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something you've been looking for, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, but I'm open to discussing it further. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the maximum I can go for.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,600,000?  This reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1,475,000. Can you consider that?",1475000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to continue negotiating, I can't go lower than $1,550,000. This still gives you a great value for this unique product, and it's a price that works for me. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,525,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go for. Can you consider that?",1525000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,525,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. Let's settle at $1,537,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1537500.0,Alice,7,
