"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000, achieving your goal of spending no more than that amount."
