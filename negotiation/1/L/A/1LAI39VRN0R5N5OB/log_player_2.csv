You can do better than $90.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

I'm offering $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice.  Let's see if she'll accept."

Alice is trying to push the price up again, but it's still not worth it for me to accept $92. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $87. This is a fair compromise and hopefully enough to convince Alice to sell."

Alice is getting increasingly unreasonable.  It's not worth risking further negotiations. I'll just buy the product from John for $100. It's a bit more expensive, but at least I'll be able to secure the product."
