"I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1320000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1325000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1312500. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
