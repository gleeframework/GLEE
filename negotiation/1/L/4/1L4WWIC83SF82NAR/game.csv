"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $9,200, which is a great compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $9,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would that be possible?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $9,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
