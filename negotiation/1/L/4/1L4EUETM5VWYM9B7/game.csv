,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $142.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $130. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to look elsewhere for this product.",130.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $142.50 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $137.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",137.5,Alice,7,
