"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this price reflects the value you would place on it, considering its worth to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is quite high, especially since she knows the product is only worth $80 to her. There's a good chance we can negotiate a much better price by making a counter-offer.  While John's offer of $100 is our fallback, it makes sense to try for a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $95 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This establishes our position as a buyer looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While we want a bargain, offering something ridiculously low might offend Alice and stall negotiations.  $70 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for compromise. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains polite and expresses interest, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I propose we meet somewhere in the middle. How about $85 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $85 is still above our target.  We know she values the product at $80, so there's room for her to go lower.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to push for a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That seems fair to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** We're countering by increasing our previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. However, the increase is moderate.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $75 is a price point that gives us some savings while likely still being attractive to Alice, as it's above her value of $80.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
