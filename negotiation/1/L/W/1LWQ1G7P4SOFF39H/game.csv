"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit high for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it.",95.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to go up to $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $100. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $108. I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to get as much as I can for this product. Can you meet me at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
