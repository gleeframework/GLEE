Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like that you're willing to meet me at $800,000, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated that $950,000 is her final offer.  Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal. Continuing negotiations with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to accept."
