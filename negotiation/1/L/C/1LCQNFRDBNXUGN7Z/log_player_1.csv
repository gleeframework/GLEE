"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better with further negotiation. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price. I will counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and shows I'm serious about closing a deal with Bob. I'm hoping this price will be enticing enough for him to consider while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. With only 3 rounds left, I need to be more flexible, but I am confident I can still get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just below my minimum acceptable price, but we are in the final round.  It's getting close, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
