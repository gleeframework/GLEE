"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market demand. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high for your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there's still room for you to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. Considering the product's value to me and the market demand, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above your budget. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like she's not willing to come down significantly further. It's getting close to your limit of 10 rounds, and you risk not getting a deal if you keep rejecting. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer, which is within your budget."
