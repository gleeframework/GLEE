"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market demand. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. Considering the product's value to me and the market demand, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
