Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a slight incentive to consider buying from you. You're leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit. Remember, you can always accept John's offer of $10,000 if Bob doesn't meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your desired $10,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,500 is tempting, it's a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at your minimum price point.  There is no benefit to rejecting and making another counteroffer, as you're unlikely to get him to go higher. It's best to accept and secure the sale at the price you're comfortable with."
