Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This would still allow you a good profit while also getting me a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it can bring substantial returns for your business.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,350,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,360,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on his $1,350,000 offer.  It's a strong price, and continuing the negotiation risks losing him as a buyer altogether. Accepting now secures a significant profit."
