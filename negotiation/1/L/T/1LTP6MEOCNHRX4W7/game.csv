"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially even more than my asking price. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This would still allow you a good profit while also getting me a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it can bring substantial returns for your business.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your offer. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,350,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen.  I'm willing to accept $1,360,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1360000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,360,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
