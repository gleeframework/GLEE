"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This allows me to stay within my financial constraints while still showing appreciation for the product's value.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not sure I can meet you at $10500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still not able to meet you at $11750. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $11250. I believe this strikes a good balance between respecting the product's value and staying within my budget.",11250.0,Bob,6,
