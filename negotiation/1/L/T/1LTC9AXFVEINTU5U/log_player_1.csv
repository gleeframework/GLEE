"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation while ensuring I'm still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $140. This is a compromise, lowering my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to what I believe Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I will reject his offer and see if we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a further compromise, but I believe it's a fair price given Bob's previous offers and the limited rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a price closer to my desired amount. While selling to John would mean losing some potential profit, it guarantees that I meet my minimum acceptable price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
