Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Creating Urgency:**  By offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager. You can then decide if a slightly lower price is acceptable."
