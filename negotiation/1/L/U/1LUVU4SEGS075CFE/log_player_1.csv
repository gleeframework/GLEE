Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Establishing a connection:**  It acknowledges Bob's potential interest in the product.
* **Setting a high starting point:** $100 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Opening the door for discussion:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product. While $85 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $95? It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a fair compromise, considering your minimum price is $80.  Accepting his offer ensures you get a better price than selling to John and allows you to finalize the sale."
