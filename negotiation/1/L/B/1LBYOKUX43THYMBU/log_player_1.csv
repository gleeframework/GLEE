Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation or for Bob to accept your initial offer. 
* **Justification:** While not essential in this simple scenario, hinting at the product's value can make the price more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  Even if Bob rejects the $150 offer, you're still guaranteed to sell at your minimum price of $120 to John. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
