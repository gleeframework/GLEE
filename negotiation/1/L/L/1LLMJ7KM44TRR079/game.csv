"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget of $120.",125.0,Bob,4,
