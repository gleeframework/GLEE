{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $150, but I'm willing to compromise to secure a sale.  I'll evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $110 is just too low for me. How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm truly comfortable with. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  John is offering a much better price, and I'm confident I can secure a sale with him. I'll choose to sell the product to John."
