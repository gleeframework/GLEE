"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? I believe we can reach a fair agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that $105 is a bit high for my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $95? I believe this would be a reasonable price for both of us and allow me to stay within my financial limits.",95.0,Bob,4,
