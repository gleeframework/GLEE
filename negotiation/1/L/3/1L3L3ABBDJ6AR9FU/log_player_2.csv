"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $14,000. This is a special offer considering its worth to you and the unique opportunity we're presenting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's offer of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. This price is fair given the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to offer it to you for $13,500. I believe this price strikes a good balance between the value of the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Although Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his $12,500 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiations, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully and I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $13,250. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise, or Bob might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a price that's within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of losing out on the deal."
