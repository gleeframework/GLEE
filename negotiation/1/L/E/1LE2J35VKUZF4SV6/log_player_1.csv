Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $130. I think it's a great deal, especially considering its value to you."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to test Bob's willingness to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  By mentioning the product's worth to Bob ($150), I'm subtly anchoring his perception of its value, making the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I'm setting the initial price with the awareness that I have a backup buyer. If Bob repeatedly rejects offers close to $100, it makes more sense to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to my valuation of the product. Would you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet me at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward, reiterating my interest in selling but also my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $115. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $115 is a reasonable compromise. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $15, which is a good outcome compared to the alternative of selling to John for $100."
