"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, encouraging Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I believe the product is quite valuable, but I am only able to pay up to $85. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
