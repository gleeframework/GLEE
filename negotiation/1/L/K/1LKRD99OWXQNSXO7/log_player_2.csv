"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a great price, and it's below what I would get from another buyer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
