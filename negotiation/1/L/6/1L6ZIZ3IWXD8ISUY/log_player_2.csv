It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice. $9,000 is a good price, but it's not the absolute best."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price but is still not there yet. I have only one round left to negotiate, and the risk of not getting a deal is high. I'm better off buying from John for $10,000 to ensure I get the product."
