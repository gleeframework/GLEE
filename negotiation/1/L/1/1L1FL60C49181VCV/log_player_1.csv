Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit lower, while still ensuring Alice gets a great deal.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, increasing the chances he'll be willing to pay a premium.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a safety net with John's offer of $1,200,000, ensuring she won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
