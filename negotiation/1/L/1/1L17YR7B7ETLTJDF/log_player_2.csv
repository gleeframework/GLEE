"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get closer to the $12,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $10,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Justification:** While I'm not giving a specific reason for the lower price, the phrase ""a bit steep"" implies it's beyond my comfortable budget.
* **Polite and Respectful:** The tone remains positive and respectful, aiming to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. It's a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll receive. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above John's offer. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate further, even if it's just to split the difference and get a slightly better deal than John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $11,500, I'm showing a willingness to compromise and meet Alice closer to the middle ground. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""ready to close the deal"" add a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to accept this offer as potentially the last one before I walk away.
* **Justification:** Highlighting it as a ""fair compromise"" subtly emphasizes that Alice is also benefiting from moving closer to my price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value and quality of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll receive and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500.  While it's only a $500 difference, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which aligns with my goal of saving as much money as possible."
