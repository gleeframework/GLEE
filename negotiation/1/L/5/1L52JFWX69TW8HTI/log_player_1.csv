Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $19,000 feels psychologically less expensive than $20,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important:**  While we start high, it's essential to be ready to adjust if Bob shows resistance or provides a counter-offer."
