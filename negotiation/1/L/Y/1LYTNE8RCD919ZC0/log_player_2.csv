Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.

You're still within your target price range and have more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this moment. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the potential benefits it will bring to my business. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement that can be reached."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be firm on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've gotten Alice's offer down to $1,320,000, which is within your target range.  While you could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the price John is offering, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to get a better deal with Alice in the remaining rounds. It's a good time to accept and secure the product."
