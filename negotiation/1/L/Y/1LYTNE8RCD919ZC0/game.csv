"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this moment. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the potential benefits it will bring to my business. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement that can be reached.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be firm on this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
