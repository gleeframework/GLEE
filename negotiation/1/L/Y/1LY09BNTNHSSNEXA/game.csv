"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its unique features and potential benefits. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is there any room for negotiation?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 may be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1800000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1600000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my own profit margins. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1400000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins any further. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $900000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1200000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,9,
