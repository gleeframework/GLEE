"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere. Can you meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,165.0
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $150. I can do $165, but that's as low as I can go. I think the product is worth a bit more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to make the sale.",165.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,155.0
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can meet you halfway between $140 and $165, which is $152.50. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this unique item.",152.5,Alice,5,,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet on a price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can meet you at $137.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this product.",137.5,Alice,7,,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I can meet you at $132.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",132.5,Alice,9,,
