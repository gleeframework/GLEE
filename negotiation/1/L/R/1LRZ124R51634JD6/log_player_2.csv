# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $7,800.  It's the best I can offer right now."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While they're getting close, Bob is now within 5 rounds of having to buy from John. To avoid risking the chance of not getting the product, Bob will buy from John to ensure he gets the product for his maximum budget."
