Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're leaving some room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a strong offer:** This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, but you're not giving away the farm.

I'll need to see how Bob responds before I can make a counteroffer or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming up from your initial price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
