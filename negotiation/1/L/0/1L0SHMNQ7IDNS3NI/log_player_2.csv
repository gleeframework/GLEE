"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $800,000 and gets Bob closer to his desired price point of $700,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth the potential for a few thousand dollars more in savings."
