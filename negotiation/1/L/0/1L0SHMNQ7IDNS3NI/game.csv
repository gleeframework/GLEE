"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
