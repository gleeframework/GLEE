Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his potential budget. 
* **Fallback Option:** Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
