Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000 to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my budget.
