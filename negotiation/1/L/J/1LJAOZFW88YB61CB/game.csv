"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
