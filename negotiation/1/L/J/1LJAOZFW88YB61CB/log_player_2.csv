# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?
