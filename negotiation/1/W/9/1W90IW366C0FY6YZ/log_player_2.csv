"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000), and also lower than the price John is selling it for ($1,500,000). Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
