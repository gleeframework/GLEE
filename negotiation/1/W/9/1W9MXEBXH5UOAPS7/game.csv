"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
