"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not able to meet at $16000. I would like to propose a price of $14000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll sell the product to you for $15000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
