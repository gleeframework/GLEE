"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still fair given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more opportunity to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $10,900?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $10,900 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.
* There are still 5 rounds remaining, so there's time to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
