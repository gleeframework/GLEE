"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to reject and see if Alice will lower the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and is still well within Bob's budget.  It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a fair price. This approach allows for potential negotiation and hopefully, a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are still more rounds to negotiate, and Bob is better off rejecting this offer and attempting to get a lower price.  He can potentially meet Alice halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,200 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about we settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to receive a good price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight reduction from Alice's last offer and is still well within Bob's budget. It shows that Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, demonstrating a commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. It also leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds, potentially leading to a final price that benefits both parties."
