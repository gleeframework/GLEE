"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I'm sure we can find mutually beneficial terms.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be priced much more realistically. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,900,000 is still well beyond what I'm able to spend. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be in a price range that makes sense for me.  Would you consider $700,000? This is a significant investment on my part, reflecting the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal come to fruition.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're making to find a compromise, but we're still quite far apart. I need to be realistic about my budget, and $1,600,000 simply doesn't fit within my limits. I'm prepared to offer $750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my constraints. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I also have to be mindful of the product's value. While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one last push to close this deal: $1,400,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my end, and I believe it's more than fair.  If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options for selling the product.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we're at an impasse. I understand your position, and I've been upfront about my budget from the beginning. I'm not able to go any higher than my last offer.  It represents a fair price for me, and I'm still very interested at that price. However, I do need to be respectful of my time. If you're not able to accept my previous offer, I'll need to pursue other options.",750000.0,Bob,8,
