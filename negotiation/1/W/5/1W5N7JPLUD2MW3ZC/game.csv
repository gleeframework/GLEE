"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think the starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,320,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,320,000 is still pushing the lower limits of what I can accept.  My final offer is $1,360,000.  This offer takes into account its value and allows me to feel comfortable with the deal.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $1,360,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,340,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really close to walking away and buying from John for $1,000,000, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",1340000.0,Bob,6,
