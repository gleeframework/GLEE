"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it still allows me to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $10,200, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,900. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9900.0,Bob,6,
