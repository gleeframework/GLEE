"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, it's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above what the product is worth to you. Buying from John lets you get the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay."
