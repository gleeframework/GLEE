It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice is consistently moving closer to your desired price point.  $920,000 is a significant reduction from her initial offer.
* **Time Constraint:** You're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. While you could push further, there's a risk Alice won't budge much more. 
* **Savings:** Accepting this offer saves you $80,000 compared to John's price. 

While there's a small chance you could get the price lower, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of Alice walking away or the stress of continued negotiation."
