Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that you value the product at $12,000. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is still too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,750.  Let's split the difference."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,600 to purchase the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $9,600 is close enough to my desired price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John for a price I'm not completely satisfied with."
