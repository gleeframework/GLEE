Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth to you and the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still pushing my budget constraints.  To be completely honest, I've also been exploring other options.  If you're able to come down to $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I might need to consider those other options seriously.
