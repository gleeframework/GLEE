"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer takes into account both the product's worth and your interest. Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $1,350,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
