"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will encourage negotiation and potentially lead to a deal closer to his $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a better price, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to negotiate while still staying below his $10,000 limit. This counteroffer demonstrates his commitment to a deal, but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,800 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's important to remember that he has the option to buy from John for $10,000, so he should push Alice to get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but there's still some room to negotiate. Offering $10,200 shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still pushing for a price lower than Alice's last offer.  This also leaves room for Alice to counteroffer again, which could bring the price closer to Bob's $10,000 goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $10,500 is only $500 over his budget, he's now approaching the end of the negotiations. It's worth risking another round to see if he can get Alice to agree to $10,000 or close to it, as John's price is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is Bob's final offer. He's pushing for his target price, and if Alice rejects, he can simply buy from John.  He's shown willingness to negotiate, and it's time to see if Alice will meet him halfway."
