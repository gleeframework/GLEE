"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $12,000 to you, so you're willing to pay up to that amount.
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's offer of $12,000.
* However, there is room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer was $11,500, and I'm aiming to save as much as possible.
* A counteroffer of $11,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. 
* It's also a price that still benefits me, as it's lower than my maximum willingness to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $11,250, which is still a better price than buying from John for $12,000. 
* While I could try to negotiate further, the difference is only $250. 
* Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal with Alice altogether, especially if she's unwilling to go lower. 
*  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking losing the deal."
