Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110:**  This price is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it gives me a decent profit while still potentially being attractive to him.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product. This sets the stage for a potentially positive negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a higher price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can then use the information to adjust my next offer, or potentially accept John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest and expressing my willingness to negotiate.  The message is positive and aims to keep the negotiation amicable. 

**Strategy:**

I'm sticking to my minimum price but trying to be flexible and find a solution that works for both of us.  This approach is likely to encourage Bob to accept the offer, as it shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $100. How about $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that the process will drag on and I might end up with an even lower offer.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids further negotiation."
