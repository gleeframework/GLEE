"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. I believe it would greatly enhance your operations and bring significant value to your business. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I am offering it to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He wants to save as much money as possible and can get the product for $8,000 from John. It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice, as he might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's quality, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, considering the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and the importance of closing this deal, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to offer the product to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still closer to his target price of $8,000 with John, and it's worth seeing if he can push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I am proposing to offer the product to you for $8900. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to his target price, it's still $900 higher than what he can get from John.  With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice to drop her price any further, and it's not worth risking losing the opportunity to buy the product from John at his desired price."
