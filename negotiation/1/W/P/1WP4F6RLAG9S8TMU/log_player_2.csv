"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm very passionate about and I know you'd appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $12,500, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is within your budget of $15,000 and saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's a risk she might refuse and you'd end up paying the full $15,000 to John."
