"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
