"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to bargain since John is willing to sell for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the lowest possible price I'm willing to pay, which is John's price.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and make a small profit, or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can push Alice down further.  If I can't, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. $11,500 is a reasonable compromise, considering Alice's last offer and my willingness to pay John's price. This should keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still not ideal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Alice down further. If she rejects, I'll happily buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a final push to see if Alice will budge. Offering $12,000 is only $1,000 above my limit, and it allows Alice to make a small profit. If she still refuses, I'll gladly accept John's offer."
