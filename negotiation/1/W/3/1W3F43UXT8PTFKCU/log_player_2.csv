"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is above your budget. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead."
