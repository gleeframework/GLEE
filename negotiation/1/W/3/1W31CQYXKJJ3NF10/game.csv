"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in [Product Name], but I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value [Product Name] at significantly more than $700000, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to reduce my price to $850000. This offer reflects the unique value and potential of [Product Name]. I believe this price is fair for both of us.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on [Product Name]. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,
