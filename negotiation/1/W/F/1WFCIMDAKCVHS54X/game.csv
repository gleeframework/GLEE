"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to me, at least $1,500,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price.  I know this product is valuable to you as well, and I want to make this a win-win situation.  Let's talk numbers. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price. What do you say? ",1300000.0,Alice,1,
