{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,500 is greater than your $10,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $1,500 of potential profit for Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** If Bob is truly interested in the product, he's likely to accept or at least counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I want for the product. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$11,500 is a good compromise. It's a bit less than my initial goal, but it's still significantly better than selling to John.  I'm confident I can find another buyer later on who might be willing to pay closer to my ideal price."
