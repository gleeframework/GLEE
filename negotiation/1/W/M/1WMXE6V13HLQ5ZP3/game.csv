"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference at $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
