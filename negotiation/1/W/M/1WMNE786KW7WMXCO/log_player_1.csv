"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing it's likely too high for Bob. This sets a strong initial bargaining position.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and highlights a ""great deal."" This aims to make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open-ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
