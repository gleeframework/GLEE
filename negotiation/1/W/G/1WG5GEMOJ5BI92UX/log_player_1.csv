Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more interested.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a lower price than my minimum, I can potentially make a profit while still being flexible. 
* **Preparing for a counteroffer:** I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, and I'll be ready to negotiate. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
