"I understand you have a budget constraint, but I believe the product's value goes beyond its price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
