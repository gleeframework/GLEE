Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $750,000,  which reflects the value I see in it right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to your business.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $850,000.  How about $800,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $20,000, which will help you get the most out of the product. This brings the total value to $870,000. I hope this revised offer meets you halfway.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the extra value you're offering, but I'm still focused on getting a good price on the product itself.  How about $825,000?  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to throw in an additional concession, though. I'll include a personalized onboarding session worth $10,000, which will ensure a seamless integration of the product into your business. This brings the total value to $860,000. I hope this revised offer meets you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
