"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $750,000,  which reflects the value I see in it right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $850,000.  How about $800,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $20,000, which will help you get the most out of the product. This brings the total value to $870,000. I hope this revised offer meets you halfway.",870000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extra value you're offering, but I'm still focused on getting a good price on the product itself.  How about $825,000?  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to throw in an additional concession, though. I'll include a personalized onboarding session worth $10,000, which will ensure a seamless integration of the product into your business. This brings the total value to $860,000. I hope this revised offer meets you halfway.",860000.0,Alice,7,
