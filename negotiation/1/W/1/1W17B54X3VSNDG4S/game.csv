"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,18000.0
"Thanks for your honesty, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18000 is still a bit more than I can manage. I'm very serious about wanting this product, but $10000 is the absolute highest I'm willing to go. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,,
