"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $95. If we can agree on that, I'll take it off your hands.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
