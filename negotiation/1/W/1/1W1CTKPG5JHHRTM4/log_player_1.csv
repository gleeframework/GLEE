Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, hoping to get close to my target while still being attractive to him. I'm also emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to reject it and see if we can negotiate a more favorable price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also reiterating the importance of finding a fair price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer is still below it. I'm going to keep negotiating in hopes of getting closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm sticking to a price that is above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing that this is a final offer, creating pressure for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $925,000 is still a touch high. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a firm offer from my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000 and I'm confident we can close the deal now."
