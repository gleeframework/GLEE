"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $7875.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",7875.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're getting close to the price I was initially looking for, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8000, but that's as low as I can go. It's the lowest price I'm willing to sell for, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
