,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price is fair.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Let's make this deal happen!",105.0,Alice,5,
