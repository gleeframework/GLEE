Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point because it:

* **Sets a price higher than your minimum.**  $150 leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures you're getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **Shows flexibility.** By mentioning being ""open to discussing a fair price"", you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Focuses on value.**  Mentioning that Bob ""would really enjoy it"" subtly suggests the product's worth, without revealing your true valuation.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum of $120, so I can't accept that.  I'll counteroffer and try to get a price closer to what I need."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price is fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$95 is still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to make another counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
