"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000 is too high for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000 but wants to save money.
* **John's Offer:**  $15,000 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay.  
* **Strategy:** It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000 is too high, so a counter-offer significantly lower is necessary. 
* **Strategy:** A $12,000 offer is a good starting point, as it's likely Alice will counter with something closer to the midpoint between her desired price and Bob's offer. This allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value to me is quite high. Could we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,000 is still too high for Bob.
* **John's Offer:** $15,000 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **Strategy:**  Reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. While $13,000 is closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,000 is still too high, but shows Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Strategy:** Offering $12,500 keeps the pressure on Alice.  It's a compromise that's more appealing to Bob than $13,000 and less than Alice's offer, making it a potential sweet spot."
