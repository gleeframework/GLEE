"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better price.  I have 10 rounds and John's offer is my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice,  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $800,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still have room to negotiate.  I'm going to try to push for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to go further.  If not, I can always buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 right now.  Let's work together and find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $875000? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $875,000 is a good price and gets me closer to my goal of saving money.  We're only 5 rounds in, so there's still time to try to negotiate further if I really want to push for a lower price. However, given the current pace of negotiations, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower. I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing out on the deal."
