"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $18000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",18000.0,Alice,3,
