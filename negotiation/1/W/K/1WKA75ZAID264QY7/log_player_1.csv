Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers $1,000,000, Alice wants to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **High but Potentially Acceptable:**  $950,000 is a high price, but it leaves room for Bob to still find the deal worthwhile considering it's worth $800,000 to him.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning another buyer, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John as a safety net."
