Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's in great condition and I think you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are willing to pay $80 maximum, and Alice is asking $90.  It is better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
