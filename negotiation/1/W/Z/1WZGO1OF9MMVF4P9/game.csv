"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. However, $10,500 is still a bit too far from what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at this price. Let's make this happen!",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,400. Can you consider this price?",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this amazing product.  $10,400 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $10,600, which is a fair compromise given its value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,300. Can you consider this price?",10300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,300 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise and come down to $10,500. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price, and I hope we can reach a deal.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to make one last offer of $10,200. If you're willing to accept this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",10200.0,Bob,10,
