"Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, however, $700,000 is significantly below its true market value. I would be willing to meet you halfway and lower the price to $875,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I'm working within a budget. Could we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here. While I appreciate your budget considerations, the $760,000 offer is still too low.  How about we split the difference again and land at $817,500? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",817500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To make this work on my end, I could go up to $780,000.  Let me know what you think.",780000.0,Bob,6,
