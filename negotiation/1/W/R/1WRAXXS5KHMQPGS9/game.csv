"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value to me, I'm looking to pay closer to its market value. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This still gives you a good profit and leaves room for us to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,400,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering your value and the potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,350,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering $1,280,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
