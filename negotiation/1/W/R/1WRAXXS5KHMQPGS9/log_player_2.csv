"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you ($1,500,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value to me, I'm looking to pay closer to its market value. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This still gives you a good profit and leaves room for us to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,400,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still a bit high. You can likely get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price. It also demonstrates your willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering your value and the potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,350,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering $1,280,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is getting close to her value of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will result in a smaller gain for you.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price."
