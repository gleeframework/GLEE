"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
