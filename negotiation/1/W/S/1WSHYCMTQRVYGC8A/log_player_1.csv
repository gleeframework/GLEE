Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Selling to John at $800,000 would be a safe option, but I'd prefer to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  This would still allow me to make a decent profit while being within a reasonable range for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget constraints. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal at this point.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we might not reach an agreement, and then I'd be forced to sell to John for the same price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
