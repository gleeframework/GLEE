"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  This would still allow me to make a decent profit while being within a reasonable range for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget constraints. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
