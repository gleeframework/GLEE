Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than mine. By starting high, I can gauge how interested he truly is and how flexible he might be. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have the security of selling to John for $150, so I can afford to be a bit bolder in my initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer is above his own valuation of the product, which indicates room for negotiation. 
* **Below My Minimum:** $120 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price and encourage him to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm glad you're interested, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway and settle on $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offers. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $160 keeps the price well above my minimum and also above the midpoint between our starting points ($160 vs $110). This maintains some pressure on Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how flexible Bob is and if a deal above my minimum is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  
* **Securing a Profit:** Accepting $140 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
