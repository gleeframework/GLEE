"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still within a range that Alice might consider, given she values the product at $1,000,000.  We'll see if she bites."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still offering a price that's above my limit. It's worth seeing if I can squeeze out a better deal before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying well below Alice's initial offer and my own limit.  Hopefully, this shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my limit, I still think I can get a better deal. I've already shown I'm willing to negotiate, so there's no reason to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer a little bit more, but still staying below my limit and closer to the middle ground between our current positions.  Alice seems to be willing to budge, so I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $890,000 is very close to my limit, I'm still going to try and negotiate a slightly lower price.  Alice is clearly getting closer to my offer, so I'm optimistic about finding a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

I'm going to make one last push with a counteroffer just below Alice's latest price.  This shows that I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to go above my limit. If she rejects this, I'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to my limit. There's only one round left, and if I reject this offer, I risk having to buy from John at a higher price. This is the best deal I'm likely to get from Alice, so I'm going to accept it."
