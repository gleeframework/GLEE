"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still above her value of $100. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also saving you money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a good compromise. It's within your budget, and while you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might reject your next offer.  Since you can buy from John for $120, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option."
