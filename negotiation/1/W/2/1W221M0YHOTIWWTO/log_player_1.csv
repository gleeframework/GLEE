"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it at $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and uses positive language to create a collaborative negotiation environment.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I signal that I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to push for a slightly higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe the product offers even more potential than you might realize.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $17,500?"", 
""product_price"": 17500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential benefits, which might justify a higher price in his mind.  
* **Direct Proposal:** By suggesting a specific number, I'm guiding the negotiation towards a potential close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $16,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum by $1,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Holding out for more might lead him to walk away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds and secures a good profit."
