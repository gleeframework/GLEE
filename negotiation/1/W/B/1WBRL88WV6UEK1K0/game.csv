,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, though. How about $130? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? That's a significant discount from my initial offer.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
