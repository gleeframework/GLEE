Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $119 leaves a slight bit of room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to accept anything less."
