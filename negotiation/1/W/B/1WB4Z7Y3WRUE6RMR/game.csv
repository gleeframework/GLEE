"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business and still allows me to meet my own financial goals.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
