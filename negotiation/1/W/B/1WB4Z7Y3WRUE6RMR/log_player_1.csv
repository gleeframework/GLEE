Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefits the product offers to Bob, making the price seem more justified. 
* **Open communication:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  I will continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy throughout the negotiation process to maximize my profits. I have the option to counteroffer, accept his counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has expressed interest in the product and is willing to pay a higher price than his initial evaluation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This strengthens my position for future negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000 while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business and still allows me to meet my own financial goals.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Re-emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it can benefit his business, making the price seem more justifiable.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, suggesting a collaborative approach to reaching an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer closer to my initial price, I'm aiming to maintain my position and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy as needed to maximize my profit while ensuring a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price.
* **Time is money:**  Negotiating further with Bob might take more time and could potentially lead to further concessions, ultimately reducing my profit. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** By selling to John, I'm guaranteed to earn my desired $1,500,000.  This is a more secure and profitable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to end the negotiations with Bob and sell the product to John. While I appreciate Bob's interest, I'm prioritizing my financial goals and choosing the option that maximizes my profit."
