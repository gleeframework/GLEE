Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120, giving me some room to negotiate.  It also allows for the possibility that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more for a product he knows is valuable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's better to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a great price for a product worth $120 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. It's a nice product and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that this process will drag on, and I might not be able to secure a price I'm happy with.  It's more efficient to sell to John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
