"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $9,500.
* While this is a good deal, you can still get it for less from John (for $10,000). 

Therefore, it's strategically better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
