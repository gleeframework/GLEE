Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation and acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still a significant loss compared to your initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. $110 is a bit high for my budget. How about we try $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but accepting Bob's offer at $105 is the best option.  It's only $5 less than your counteroffer, and significantly more than selling to John.  At this point, further negotiation risks losing the sale altogether."
