# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal. Accepting at $800,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
