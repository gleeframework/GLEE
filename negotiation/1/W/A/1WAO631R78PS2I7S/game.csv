"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
