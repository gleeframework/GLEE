"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know you'd get a lot of use out of it. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is selling it for $10,000. This means you save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're getting a good deal.**  The product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's willing to sell it for $10,000. This suggests she's motivated to sell and is willing to make a small profit. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
