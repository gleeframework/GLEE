"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe  $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $600,000 is a bit low for me. Considering the value you place on the product is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for profit, while also acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  To be frank, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $700,000.  If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you've found a similar product elsewhere, Bob, but I'm confident that this one is superior in quality and features. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I need to make a profit. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
