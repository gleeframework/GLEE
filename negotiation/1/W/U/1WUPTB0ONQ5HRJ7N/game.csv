"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $10,250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to budge a bit as well. How about $9,750? That gets us closer to a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10000.0,Alice,7,
