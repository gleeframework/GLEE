Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is still too low, but I'm starting to run out of time. I'll counteroffer and see if we can close the deal before I have to sell to John."

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation rounds and Bob isn't budging much.  I'm not sure if I can get a better offer than $1,000,000 from John, so I'll sell to him and avoid risking losing even more money by continuing to negotiate."
