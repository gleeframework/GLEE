"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1400000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know if you're interested, or if you'd like to discuss other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go as high as $1,250,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal.  While $1,350,000 is closer to his maximum budget, he's still willing to risk a further round of negotiation to see if he can get a lower price.  If he accepts, he loses some potential savings."
