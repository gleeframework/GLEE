You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, even though there's a risk she might reject his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price and knows that John is willing to sell for $10,000. This is his best starting point to see if Alice is willing to meet his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and he should try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $12,000, which is halfway between his maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This shows Alice he's serious about buying, but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging much, and her offer of $16,500 is still way above Bob's budget. At this point, Bob has had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like Alice is not willing to go lower.  It's now more advantageous to buy from John for $10,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
