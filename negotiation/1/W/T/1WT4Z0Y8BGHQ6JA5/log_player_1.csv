Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
