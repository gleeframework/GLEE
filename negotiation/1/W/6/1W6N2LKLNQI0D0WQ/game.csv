"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to invest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see that we're getting closer.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you a little closer to the middle at $1,280,000. This would still be a significant gain for you, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we'll never meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,220,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
