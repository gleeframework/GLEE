"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to invest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction.
