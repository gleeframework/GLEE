"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're trying to work with me. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a price closer to Alice's value ($100). 
* **Compromise:**  $105 is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while also seeking a better deal.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's initial offer, making the counteroffer more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains leverage in the negotiation.  He can continue to push for a lower price.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Rushing into an acceptance could mean missing out on an even better deal later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $112.50 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  Would you consider $110? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** Bob is proposing a small increase from his previous offer, showing he's serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Fairness emphasis:**  He emphasizes ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Alice's sense of compromise.
* **Finalizing the deal:**  The message suggests that this price point could be the final step to close the deal."
