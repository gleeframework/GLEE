"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1200000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my desired price, but it's closer. I have 7 rounds remaining, so I can continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value and my budget. Let's aim for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price with her offer of $1,075,000.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm within my budget, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep pushing. Accepting the offer is the best choice to avoid the risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at a much higher price."
