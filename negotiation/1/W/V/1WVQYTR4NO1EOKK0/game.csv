"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit lower than I was expecting.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1200000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1200000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value and my budget. Let's aim for a final agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
