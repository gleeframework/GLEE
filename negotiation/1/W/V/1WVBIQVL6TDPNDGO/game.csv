"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still significantly lower than my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could I offer you $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $12,000.  Would you consider $14,000?  This is a significant discount from my original asking price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $13,000?  That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
