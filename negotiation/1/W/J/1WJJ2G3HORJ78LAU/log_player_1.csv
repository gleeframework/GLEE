"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There are still rounds left, so I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Selling to John at this point would leave me with a much better profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $725,000 is still significantly lower than my target. I have more rounds left and can still try to push for a better deal. Selling to John at this point would be more profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000, which is a significant compromise. This price reflects the value the product brings to you, and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's try to find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
