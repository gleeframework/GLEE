Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm trying to balance getting a good price with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum price of $120, Bob is getting closer to my price.  $90 is a reasonable compromise, and it's important to close the deal before he walks away completely."
