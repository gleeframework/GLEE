Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable offering $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly increased his offer, but it's still below John's guaranteed offer. There's potential for Bob to go higher, so it's worth negotiating further."
