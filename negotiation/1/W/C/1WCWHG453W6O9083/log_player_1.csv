Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic. Here's why:

* **Higher than John's offer:** It's above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you make more than selling to John.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as the product is worth more to him. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob may counter-offer, giving you room to negotiate a price closer to your desired outcome."
