"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I propose a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer ($1,100,000), I leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Enthusiasm:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still substantially lower than my initial ask and leaves a considerable sum on the table compared to his perceived value.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe the value of this product sits significantly higher than your proposed price. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,025,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly reduced my ask from $1,100,000 to $1,025,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer is a strong signal that I'm aiming for a price above $1,000,000. It also encourages Bob to counter with a more aggressive offer if he's truly interested. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're in Round 3 out of 10, so there's still time to negotiate, but I need to push Bob closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I still think $950,000 is a reasonable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly staying near his initial offer, and while he moved a bit, it's clear he's trying to anchor the negotiation close to his starting point. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a price closer to $1 million.  By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not going to easily concede, and hopefully encourage him to make a more substantial jump.  I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. To be frank, $975,000 is significantly below what I believe to be the true value of this product.  Let's aim for a more substantial agreement. How about $1,000,000 even? This shows significant movement on my side and demonstrates my willingness to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stand:** I'm holding firm at the $1,000,000 mark, making it clear this is a significant threshold for me.
* **Justified Value:** I'm reiterating that his offer is significantly below my valuation, emphasizing that I'm not just negotiating for the sake of it.
* **Final Push:** By offering a round number ($1,000,000) and framing it as a significant concession, I'm applying pressure for him to accept or make a meaningful counter-offer.
* **Time Factor:**  We are halfway through the rounds, and I need to gauge his seriousness.  If he doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, I may need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While $980,000 is slightly below my target, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of losing Bob entirely.  
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent six rounds negotiating. Accepting now saves time and provides certainty in closing the deal.
* **Strong Position:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating genuine interest and willingness to compromise. 
* **Solid Profit:** $980,000 is a substantial profit margin above my minimum sale price.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and having to settle for John's $800,000 offer is too significant at this point.  Accepting $980,000 secures a very favorable outcome."
