Alice's offer of $600,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

While Alice's counteroffer of $550,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before resorting to buying from John."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $525,000, which is within my budget and a good deal considering the product's value to me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll walk away or I'll run out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
