"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
