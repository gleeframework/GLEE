Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's standing offer of $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price for the product and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling out below that threshold."
