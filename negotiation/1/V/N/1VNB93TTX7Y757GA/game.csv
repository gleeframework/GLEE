"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's see if we can make this work!",800000.0,Alice,3,
