{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and positive, aiming to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. Based on Bob's response, I will adapt my strategy. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* I will always keep in mind my minimum acceptable price of $120 and the option to sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's message shows interest in the product, indicating there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer is the best strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price point. I will consider factors like Bob's initial counteroffer and the value of the product to me when crafting my counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about $130? That's still a good price for a quality product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $150 to $130.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $130 is a reasonable counteroffer, considering my minimum price of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Positive Language:** The message maintains a friendly and positive tone, aiming to keep the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between finding a price that's acceptable to me and remaining open to negotiation.  By offering a price closer to Bob's initial offer but still above my minimum, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price without losing too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $130. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob is showing persistence and willingness to negotiate, indicating there's still room for improvement.
* **Counteroffer is the best strategy:** I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a bit more.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $115 and my minimum of $120. I will emphasize the value of the product and the fact that I'm already compromising."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $115 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  This product is really high-quality, and I'm already compromising.  Would you be willing to go to $118?  That's just a little more, but I think it's fair considering the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, showing willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality, justifying my slightly higher price.
* **Finality:**  The message implies that $118 is my final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to reach a final agreement with Bob while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  By offering a price close to Bob's last offer but emphasizing the value of the product, I hope to convince Bob to accept the deal. If Bob rejects, I will still have the option to sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is high-quality, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $118. How about $116.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close but not enough:**  Bob's offer of $116.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still slightly below.
* **Negotiation is tiring:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it's possible that further negotiation won't yield a significant increase in price.
* **John's offer is a secure option:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a slightly higher price, I'm choosing to minimize risk and ensure a guaranteed profit by accepting John's offer. It's a strategic decision to avoid the potential for further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
