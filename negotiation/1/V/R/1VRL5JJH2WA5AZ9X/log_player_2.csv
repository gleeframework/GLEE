"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $8,000. Let's discuss if this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since Alice's first offer is exactly her valuation of the product, there's no immediate advantage to accepting. It makes sense for Bob to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. While I'm interested, $8,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a middle ground at $7,750? This respects your budget while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $7,750, Bob can save $250 compared to buying from John.  While Bob might try to negotiate further, the potential savings are not significant enough to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John.  It's a good deal for Bob."
