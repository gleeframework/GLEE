Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I would like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget.

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a better deal before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is a good deal for me, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than John's offer. It's also important to note that Bob stated this is his final offer, so if I reject it, I risk losing the deal entirely."
