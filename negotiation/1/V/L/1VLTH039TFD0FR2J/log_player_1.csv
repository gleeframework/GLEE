"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least my minimum of $10,000.  I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, I still have room to negotiate. I want to see if I can push for a better price before potentially settling with John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have a few rounds left and I'm not yet desperate enough to take his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,000, my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob, having rejected my previous offers, will finally agree to this price.  If he doesn't, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
