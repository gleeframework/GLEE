"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'd like to get it as close to that as possible. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand you're looking to get close to $8000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $9500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $11000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9000.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new offer of $9500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. However, I'm also considering buying from John for $8000 if we can't come to an agreement. Can you consider my final offer of $9500?",9500.0,Bob,8,
