"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $750,000 is a bit higher than my budget at the moment. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is still a fair price, considering its value to me. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
