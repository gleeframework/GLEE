Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $750,000 is a bit higher than my budget at the moment. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is still a fair price, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
