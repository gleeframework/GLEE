Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows you a good profit margin while also ensuring I can achieve my desired outcome. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.
