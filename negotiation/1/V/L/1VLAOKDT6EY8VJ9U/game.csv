"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll be able to generate significant returns from it. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to make a fair profit, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows you a good profit margin while also ensuring I can achieve my desired outcome. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, as I mentioned earlier. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price that balances our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,
