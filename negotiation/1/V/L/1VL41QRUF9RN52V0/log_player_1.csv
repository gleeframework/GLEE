Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000).
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a win-win."
