Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a price that is higher than my minimum threshold of $10,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob, as the product is worth $12,000 to him. This initial offer allows for a potentially mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, but it's still not ideal. I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly to $11,250. This is still below Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my desired price point.  I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both benefit from the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it's only slightly lower than my minimum threshold. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale and potentially losing the deal altogether, as I can always sell to John for $10,000. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale with a profit, minimizing the risk of losing out on a better deal."
