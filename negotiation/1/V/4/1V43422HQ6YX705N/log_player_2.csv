# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is still far too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $850,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the significant value this product offers. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal."
