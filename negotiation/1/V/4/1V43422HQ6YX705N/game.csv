"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we settle around $600,000? I think that's a fair price that  acknowledges the value while working for my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, acknowledging your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is still far too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $850,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the significant value this product offers. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
