"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,500,000 is above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly.  However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let's close this transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything below $1,275,000. This offer reflects the value this product brings.  Let me know if this works for you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this done.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
