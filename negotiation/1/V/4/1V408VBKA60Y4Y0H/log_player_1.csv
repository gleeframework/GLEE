Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation without going over.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By framing the offer as ""exclusive"" and highlighting the ""potential value,"" the message aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a unique deal."
