"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's important to negotiate and try to get a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** My first counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm seeking a good deal. 
* **Polite and Positive:** While firm, my message maintains a respectful and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Target Price in Mind:** I know John offers the product for $8,000, so my goal is to get Alice's price significantly closer to that before considering accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $9,000 is still higher than John's offer. It's worth negotiating further to see if I can get Alice closer to $8,000 or at least a bit lower than her current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  I'm making it clear that $8,000 is my final offer. This emphasizes that I'm serious and limits back-and-forth.
* **Matching John's Price:** By offering $8,000, I'm putting the decision in Alice's hands. She can either accept my offer or potentially lose the sale altogether. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" adds a touch of urgency, encouraging Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but $8,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has stated that $9,500 is her final offer.  She's already shown she's willing to walk away from the deal at a lower price.
* **Saving Money is Key:**  John's offer of $8,000 is significantly better than Alice's final offer. Saving $1,500 is substantial and makes walking away worthwhile. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** While we have a few rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will change her mind significantly enough to justify continuing the negotiation."
