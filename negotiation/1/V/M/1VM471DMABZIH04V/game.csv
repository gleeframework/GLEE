"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but $8,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",9500.0,Alice,5,
