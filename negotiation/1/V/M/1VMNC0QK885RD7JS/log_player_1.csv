Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still having a high chance of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **For Bob:**  The offer is still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $1,200,000. He gets a $50,000 discount. 
* **For me:** This offer gives me a profit of $150,000, which is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.

There is a chance Bob might counter-offer, but this starting point should encourage him to accept."
