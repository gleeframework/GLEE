"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also significantly lower than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000). There's plenty of room for negotiation. It's best to reject the initial offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is still well below my maximum budget and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but it's still above what I think is fair, considering what the product is worth to her. I'm not in a rush and there's still time to negotiate. I'll reject the offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me, but we're getting closer to a deal. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price with a little more negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to get her down to my last offer of $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this out!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1,062,500, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,062,500 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,050,000. It's likely that we won't get much closer with further negotiation.  Since I have a limited number of rounds and John's offer is much higher, accepting this offer will save me a significant amount of money."
