Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $950,000 is considerably less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle; would you consider $1,075,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me here.  That being said, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $1,000,000 even? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While we could push for more, Bob has met our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee we can get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
