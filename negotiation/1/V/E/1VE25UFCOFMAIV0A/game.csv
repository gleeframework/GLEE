"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you do $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting close. How about $78? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy at that price.",78.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I can go down to $95, but that's my final offer.",95.0,Alice,7,
