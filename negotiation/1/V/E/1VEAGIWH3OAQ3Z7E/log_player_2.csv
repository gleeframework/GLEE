"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with her first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her. We'll see if she takes it or counters with a better offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will try to negotiate a lower price again."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,400,000. This is a good compromise point, as it's still lower than Alice's offer but closer to the value she places on the product. This may be a good enough price for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my limit. It's possible that if I reject this offer, Alice might counter with an even higher price, especially since she's already rejected two of my counteroffers.  Buying from John is still an option, but at this point, it's a safer bet to accept Alice's offer and get the product."
