"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $92.50. Can you consider this price?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $92.50, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet at $95?  This is a fair compromise that gives us both something to gain.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're so close!  I'm willing to come down a little more to $94.  This is my final offer. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If you don't, I'll have to move on to other options.",94.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $94 is still a bit too high for me. I'll offer $92. Can you meet me at this price?",92.0,Bob,8,
