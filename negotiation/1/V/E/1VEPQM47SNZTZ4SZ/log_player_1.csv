Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $90, I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I believe I can get closer to that price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $92.50, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet at $95?  This is a fair compromise that gives us both something to gain."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

You have three options:
