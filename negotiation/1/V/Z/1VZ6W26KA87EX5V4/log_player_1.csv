Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price of $11,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. 
* You could adjust the initial offer slightly lower if you believe Bob might not negotiate and is highly price-sensitive."
