I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get close to what I want.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still want to get a good deal. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to negotiate at this price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with $95, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'll see if I can get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still confident that I can get a good deal. This is my last offer before I consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the best I've gotten so far, and it's only a little below my minimum. I'm satisfied with this outcome and it's better than selling to John."
