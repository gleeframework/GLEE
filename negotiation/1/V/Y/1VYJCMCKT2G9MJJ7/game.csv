"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which still allows you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move forward, I could consider $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations. I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
