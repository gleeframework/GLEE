``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, but it's still above my preferred price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push the price down further before going with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and support package, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already made a final offer, and I'm not sure further negotiation will get me any lower.  John is offering the product for my maximum budget, so it's the safest option to avoid any further risk of a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations."
