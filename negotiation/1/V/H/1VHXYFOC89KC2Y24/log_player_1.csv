Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives us room to negotiate while ensuring I make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is still a good price, but I believe I can get closer to my desired $1,450,000.  I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but this is the closest I can come."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,325,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm confident I can get a better price. We have 6 rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,325,000 is a bit too high, I can offer $1,300,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiations. While I could continue to counter Bob's offers, there's a real chance we won't reach an agreement that satisfies me.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get a guaranteed profit and don't risk losing out completely."
