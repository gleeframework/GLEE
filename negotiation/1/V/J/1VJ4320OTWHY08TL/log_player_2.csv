"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105 is a good starting point, so I'll stick with my previous counteroffer.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $105.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal with John for $100."
