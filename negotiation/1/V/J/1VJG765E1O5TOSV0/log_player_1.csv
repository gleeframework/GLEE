"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I think it's worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully encourages him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110?  It's a great price for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105? Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $105 is a good price, and I'm running out of time.  I'm not sure if I can get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk selling to John for only $80."
