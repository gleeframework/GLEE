Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000 before considering other buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000) and John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, making it an attractive proposition. 
* **Time Value:** While you have a backup buyer, closing the deal with Bob quickly might be more advantageous than waiting.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept."
