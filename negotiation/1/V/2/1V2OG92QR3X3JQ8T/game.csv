"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Would you consider a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95. How does that sound?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I understand $125 is still high for you, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is the best I can do at this point. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
