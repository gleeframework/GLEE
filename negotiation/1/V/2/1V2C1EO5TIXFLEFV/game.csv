,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only if you're prepared to go up to $1000000. This is my final offer. If you can't meet this, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. That's the maximum I can go.",980000.0,Bob,6,
