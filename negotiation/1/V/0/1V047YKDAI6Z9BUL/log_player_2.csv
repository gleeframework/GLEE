"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's mutually beneficial. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly starting high. While her message tries to inflate the product's value to you, you know your upper limit is $1,000,000. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price. This opens the door for further negotiation where Alice might lower her price to avoid losing the sale. You can always fall back on buying from John for $1,000,000 if needed."
