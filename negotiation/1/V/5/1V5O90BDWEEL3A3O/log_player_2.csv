"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better. He has a higher ceiling with John and should see if he can get Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay from John.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and a better deal than John's offer. It's also a fair compromise from Alice, indicating a willingness to meet in the middle."
