"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's fair to both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $105. How about we try $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too expensive for me. How about we try $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $97? That's a fair price, and it allows us to close this deal. ",97.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $97 is still a bit too expensive for me. How about we try $94? I'm willing to make a bit of a compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",94.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to meet you halfway again, and offer you $96.  This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",96.0,Alice,9,
