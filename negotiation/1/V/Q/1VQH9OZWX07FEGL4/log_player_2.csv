"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount compared to the product's value to him ($150). It's worth negotiating further to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his ideal price. He can likely squeeze out a better deal with further negotiation, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're pushing for a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's quality and uniqueness. How about we meet at $115, and we can call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the product for as low as possible. While $115 is lower than John's price, it is still higher than what Bob would ideally pay.  The negotiation has been back and forth, with both parties showing willingness to compromise. This suggests that a lower price is still possible. Bob can continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, as he still has a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $110. This price is within my budget and allows us to both walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'd like to throw in an additional benefit to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly? This way, you'll be getting even more value for your money. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $110 is within Bob's budget and close to his target price.
* **Added Value:** The free accessory adds extra value to the deal, making it more appealing. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, it's a good time to accept a reasonable offer. Further negotiation could lead to a better price, but there's also a risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Price:** John is still offering the product for $150, making Alice's offer significantly better.

While Bob might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the added accessory makes this offer a good deal overall, considering the limited time and the potential to lose out on a better price with John."
