"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a fair price for this great product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're pushing for a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's quality and uniqueness. How about we meet at $115, and we can call it a deal?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $110. This price is within my budget and allows us to both walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'd like to throw in an additional benefit to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly? This way, you'll be getting even more value for your money. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
