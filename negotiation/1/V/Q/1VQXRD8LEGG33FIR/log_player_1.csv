Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to try and maximize my profit by starting high and then being willing to negotiate downwards if necessary. However, I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't offer a price I'm happy with, as I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. However, it's still higher than the guaranteed price I can get from John.  Since I want to maximize my profit, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still higher than what Bob offered and significantly more than I can get from John.
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a compromise to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, hoping to influence his decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground that gives me a good profit while still being attractive to Bob. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below the $1,000,000 I can guarantee with John. I'm not yet ready to settle for a price lower than my guaranteed offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,025,000. This is a compromise, as it's exactly halfway between my previous offer and his last offer. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm focusing on the idea that this is a ""fair price"" and that it benefits both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of reason and potentially makes him more likely to accept. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly hinting at the need for a solution (""Let's find a solution...""). This creates a sense of urgency and might push Bob towards acceptance.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a ""sweet spot"" where the price is high enough for me but still within Bob's potential budget. I'm also using persuasive language to encourage Bob to accept this counteroffer. If he doesn't, I'm still prepared to accept John's offer and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's the most I can afford. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly the same as what I can get from John.  Since I'm aiming to maximize my profit, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision in this scenario. This ensures I secure the highest possible price for the product."
