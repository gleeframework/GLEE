"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit over my budget. Could you do $10,800?  That would work well for me.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a good compromise that still allows me to get a fair price for my product.  Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,5,
