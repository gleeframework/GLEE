"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the initial gesture. However, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the market and our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1350000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $1320000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1320000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1275000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
