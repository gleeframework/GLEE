{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant saving and me a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is slightly above your minimum but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 12000}
