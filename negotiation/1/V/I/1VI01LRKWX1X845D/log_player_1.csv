Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $100 for it. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
