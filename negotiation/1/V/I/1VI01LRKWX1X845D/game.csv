"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $100 for it. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with a price of $105 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
