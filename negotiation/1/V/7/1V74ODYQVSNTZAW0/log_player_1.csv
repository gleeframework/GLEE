This offer starts high, but it's still below the minimum price I'm willing to sell for.  It gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but it also shows him that I believe in the value of my product."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
