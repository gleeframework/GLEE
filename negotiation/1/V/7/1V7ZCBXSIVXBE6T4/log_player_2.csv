"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, you can likely do better.  You have a maximum budget of $150, and Alice values the product at $100. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $120, which is a good price for you.  It's within your budget, and still gives Alice a decent profit.  There's a risk that you could try to negotiate further, but you could also risk Alice backing out or going back to her original $130 price.  At $120, you're saving $30 compared to John's offer.  Accepting is the safest and most financially advantageous option."
