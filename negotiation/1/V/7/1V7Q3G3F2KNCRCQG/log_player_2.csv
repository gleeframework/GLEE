"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's within your budget, you want to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's start with a price of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to make this deal happen, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still a bit high. I'm aiming to get the price down even further. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my previous one to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value.  Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This feels like a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to move closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
