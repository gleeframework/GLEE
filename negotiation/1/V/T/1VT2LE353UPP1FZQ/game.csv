"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the potential it holds for your business.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way too high. While I see the value of this product, $2,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal considering the unique advantages this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $2,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while still staying within my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it still falls short of the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,750,000, but it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
