{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $8000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price, so I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This reflects the unique value and quality of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm proposing a price that's still above my minimum but acknowledges Bob's budget concerns. I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There's no reason to continue negotiating, so I'll accept his offer."
