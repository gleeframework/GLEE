Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm not comfortable selling the product for that price. I believe it's worth more than that. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,500 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000, and John is already willing to pay that.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
