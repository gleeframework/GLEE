Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a great investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, implying the product's ""significant value"" and it being a ""great investment"" aims to frame it as desirable.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. How much you're willing to lower your price depends on your risk tolerance and how much you want to close the deal with Bob specifically."
