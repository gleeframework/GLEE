{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the return you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay a premium.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, there's a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000."
