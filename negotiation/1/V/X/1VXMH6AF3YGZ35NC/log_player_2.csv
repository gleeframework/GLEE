"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can still potentially get a better price by counteroffering. He has the advantage of knowing John is willing to sell for $100, giving him a clear target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $105, which is halfway between his ideal price of $100 and Alice's offer of $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is only $5 more than Bob's ideal price of $100.  It's likely further negotiation won't get him a much lower price, and the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer means he could end up paying more. Accepting her offer is the best option in this situation."
