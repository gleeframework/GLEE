"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested, $1,700,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $1,400,000 is a little below what I need to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product fairly, and gives us both a good outcome.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $1,450,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,525,000.  I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,525,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,475,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1475000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
