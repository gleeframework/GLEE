"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is higher than the product's worth to her ($80), but it's still within your budget of $120. However, you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  There's room for negotiation, and you might be able to get the product for a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm interested in the product but I'm not sure I can go that high. Would you be willing to accept $90 for it? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
