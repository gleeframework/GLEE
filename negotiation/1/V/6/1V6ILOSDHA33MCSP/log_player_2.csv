It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice seems firmly planted above $12,000.  At this point, you're risking getting stuck with an even worse deal if you push further. John's $15,000 is your safety net, and it's better to secure that price than to gamble on Alice coming down significantly in the last round."
