"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1600000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground.  Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
