Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're still above your target price of $8,000, and you know John is willing to sell for that amount. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
