Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but it also sets a strong starting point. I believe the product is worth more than this to me, so I'm hoping to get as close to that as possible. I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to see if he's interested and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,500,000.  This is a good outcome for me, as I'm able to achieve my minimum goal."
