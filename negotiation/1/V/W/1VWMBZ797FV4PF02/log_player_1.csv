Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $800,000. However, it leaves him with a potential $300,000 gain if he leverages the product effectively, making it a tempting offer.
* **First Refusal Incentive:**  By offering it to Bob first, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency. This might encourage him to accept the offer rather than risk losing the opportunity."
