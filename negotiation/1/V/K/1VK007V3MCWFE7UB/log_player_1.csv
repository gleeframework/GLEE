I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

$90 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm countering with $120. It's a compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is higher than John's offer of $100. Even though it's still slightly lower than I'd hoped, it's a good deal for me and I'm happy to accept it."
