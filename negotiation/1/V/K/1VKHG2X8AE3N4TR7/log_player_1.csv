Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $9,500, we create a potential win-win:

* **Bob's Perspective:**  He gets the product for $1,500 less than our guaranteed sale price, potentially saving money.
* **Alice's Perspective:** We make $500 more than Bob values the product at, increasing our profit significantly."
