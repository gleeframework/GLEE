Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product, as that's its value to me.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price of $900,000, which is more than Bob's maximum but less than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation and ensuring a sale in the worst-case scenario."
