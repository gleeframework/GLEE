"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and would give you a good return.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and the original price I was willing to accept.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,750.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $8,625 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $9,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9100.0,Alice,5,
