"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite comfortable with $1100000, but I'm willing to pay a bit more. How about $1050000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a bit higher than $1050000.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1075000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1075000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm sticking to my original target of saving as much as possible. How about $1050000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
