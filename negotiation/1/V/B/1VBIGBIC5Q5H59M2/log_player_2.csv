```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,300,000? It's still a great price for a product worth a lot more, and it gives you a significant savings.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is a better price than her initial offer, he can still get the product for less from John. There are still rounds left to negotiate with Alice, so there's a chance he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for you as well.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down to $1,275,000, which is only $75,000 more than John's offer.  Since there are only 5 rounds left, it's likely that he won't be able to get a better price from Alice.  It's time to close the deal."
