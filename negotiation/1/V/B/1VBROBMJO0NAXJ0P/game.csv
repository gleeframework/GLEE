"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $9,600. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",9600.0,Alice,7,
