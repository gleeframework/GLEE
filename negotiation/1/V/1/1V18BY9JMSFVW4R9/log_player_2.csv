"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you're interested in, for $140. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While you could try to haggle Alice down further, accepting the $140 offer is a good deal. It falls within your budget and saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
