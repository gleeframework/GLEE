Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This price is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's still a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm confident that I can still sell the product to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a significant profit for me and closer to my ideal price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is a decent amount and getting closer to a deal.  At this point, I'm not sure if I can get him to move higher, and the risk of further negotiation might mean losing him as a buyer.  It's also worth noting that selling to John would mean I'd be walking away from a profit of $80,000.  So, I'll accept Bob's offer."
