Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but wants to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start at $120, it might make Bob feel like there's no room for negotiation and discourage him from engaging. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
