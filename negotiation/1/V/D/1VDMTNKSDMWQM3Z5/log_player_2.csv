"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He's aiming for a price closer to $8,000, and $10,000 is still too high. He has time to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $9,500. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice is getting closer to his target price, $9,500 is still a bit too high. Bob has room to negotiate further, especially since he has the option of buying from John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
