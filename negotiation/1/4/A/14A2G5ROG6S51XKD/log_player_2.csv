{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is the most aggressive offer I can make while still being within my acceptable price range.  Hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate from her initial asking price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise. $900,000 is still within my budget, and it's a reasonable step closer to Alice's current offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also still have room to negotiate."
