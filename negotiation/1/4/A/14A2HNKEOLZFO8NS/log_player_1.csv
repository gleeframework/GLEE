{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do think this product has value, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $10,250 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is what I'd be able to get the product for elsewhere.  Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $10,000 is the value I placed on the product.  It's a good deal, and I'd rather close the deal than risk losing him to another buyer."
