"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $14000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. There's room for negotiation since Alice's minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This shows he's serious about negotiating but also leaves room for Alice to compromise.
* **Value Consideration:** Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum value ($15,000) but also factoring in the need to beat Alice's minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial counteroffer is a strong starting point for further negotiation. It positions Bob to potentially get a better deal, while also keeping the negotiation process going."
