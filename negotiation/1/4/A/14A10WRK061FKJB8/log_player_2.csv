Bob has reached the 9th round, and while Alice has come down significantly, she's still above his target price. He's likely to get into a bidding war with Alice. Instead of continuing to negotiate, Bob should buy the product from John for $15,000. This is a guaranteed price within his budget and saves him time and the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
