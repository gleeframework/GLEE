"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $750,000 is a decent start.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you can try to push the price down further in subsequent rounds. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You have the option to go to John if the negotiation fails, but it's always better to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** Starting with a lower offer ($700,000) sets the tone for a strong negotiation.
* **Reasonable expectation:** While $700,000 is a significant price drop, it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.
* **Room for further compromise:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffer in the subsequent rounds, keeping in mind the 10-round limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** $725,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and a reasonable price for the product. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a price increase by Alice.
* **Time constraint:**  With 10 rounds remaining, it's important to balance the potential for further savings with the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and leaves room for potentially finding an even better price from another seller later if you decide to."
