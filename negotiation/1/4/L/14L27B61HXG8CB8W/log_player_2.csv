Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, however,  $1,500,000 undervalues its true potential. I'd be willing to part with it for $1,700,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is a price I believe we can both agree is fair.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also being reasonable for you."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  How about we settle this right now for $1,625,000?  This slight adjustment ensures we both walk away feeling good about the deal.
