Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be watching closely to see if he accepts, makes a counteroffer, or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than his last offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $98 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to go. To guarantee a profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
