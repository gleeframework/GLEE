"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my expectations.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000.

This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my expectations.",890000.0,Alice,5,
