"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value and rarity you mentioned.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for that price. Considering its rarity and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. Considering the value and rarity of the product, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1050000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $925000. I think this is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. If this offer is rejected, I'll need to consider buying from John for $800000.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm sorry, but I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to pay $975000 for the product. I'm going to have to consider buying from John for $800000.
