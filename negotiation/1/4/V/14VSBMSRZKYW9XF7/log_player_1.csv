Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still far from our minimum acceptable price.  We need to show firmness to steer him closer to a reasonable offer. We are willing to risk losing him to get closer to our target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly above $950,000. I can go as low as $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm getting close to my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob stating ""$975,000 is his final offer"" is a tactic to pressure us.  We are only in round 6. Holding firm and rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open, and we can use the next round to signal our willingness to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but to be completely transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price of $1,200,000. However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to match this offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, and I will need to move forward with the other offer."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to play our strongest card. Letting Bob know about John's offer creates urgency and demonstrates the real value of the product. It's a calculated risk, as Bob might not believe us, but it's unlikely he'll reach our desired price without this push. This strategy forces a decision from Bob, potentially leading to a favorable outcome for us in the next round."
