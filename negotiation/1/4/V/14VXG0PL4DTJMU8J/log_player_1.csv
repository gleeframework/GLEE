Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He saves $100,000 compared to its value to him, and you earn $100,000 more than your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested parties adds a level of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you're primarily focused on maximizing profit in this single transaction. If building a long-term relationship with Bob is a priority, a different approach might be more suitable."
