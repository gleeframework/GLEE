"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the initial price point.  However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price point you've suggested. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm going to propose $950,000. This is a significant amount less than your initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $950,000 offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000 for the product. This is a compromise that gets closer to your target price while still recognizing the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
