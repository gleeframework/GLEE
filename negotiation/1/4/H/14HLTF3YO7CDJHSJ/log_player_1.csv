Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000?

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, this is a very unique product, and I'm confident you won't find this value proposition elsewhere.  I can go as low as $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative.  Would you consider $1,200,000?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating and try for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly very interested and has steadily increased his offer.  Accepting $1,200,000 now represents a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
