"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I recognize your offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, this is a very unique product, and I'm confident you won't find this value proposition elsewhere.  I can go as low as $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
