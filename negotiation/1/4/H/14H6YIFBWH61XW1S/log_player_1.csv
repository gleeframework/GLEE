"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum.** $120 is comfortably above your minimum price of $80, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value.**  At $120, Bob is still getting a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation.** You've left some wiggle room to potentially negotiate further if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, there's still room for improvement.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110? This gives us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
