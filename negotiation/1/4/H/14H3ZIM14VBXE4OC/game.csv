"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500 again. Can you meet me halfway at $9,062.50?",9062.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price point, but $9,062.50 is still a bit low for me. To meet in the middle, how about $9,150? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",9150.0,Alice,7,
