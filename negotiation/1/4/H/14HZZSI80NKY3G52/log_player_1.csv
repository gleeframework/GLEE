Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider accepting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I state it's the ""best I can do *right now*"", leaving open the possibility of moving further down the line. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product for a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have a potential buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage to push for a better price with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point and see if we can find common ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer of $11,500 and my initial offer of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise and encourages him to move closer to my price.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the value the product offers, suggesting that even at $12,000, it's still a good deal.
* **Clear Next Step:** I leave the ball in Bob's court, asking for his decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a price closer to my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, so I'd like to make an offer of $11,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  I've made concessions and Bob's offers are getting closer to his initial price, not mine. Further negotiation seems unlikely to get me to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale, securing my minimum value."
