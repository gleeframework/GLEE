"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. My initial price is $1000000. This is a fair price given the product's worth and the market value. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $700000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to achieve my target.  I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $850000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we try $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
