"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,837,500? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1837500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,837,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we try $1,387,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",1387500.0,Bob,4,
