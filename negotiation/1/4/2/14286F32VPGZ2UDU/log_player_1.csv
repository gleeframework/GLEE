Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This is the absolute maximum I can do, and I believe it's a very fair price considering John is offering the same.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my baseline price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures a fair deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
