Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($950,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. It's a significant markup from his perceived value ($800,000) but still a potential ""deal"" compared to him missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, there's some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated, allowing you to potentially secure an even better deal."
