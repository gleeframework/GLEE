"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) provides room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's enthusiasm and flexibility. His response will be crucial in determining our next move.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for this product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is above our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and aim higher. Rejecting this offer signals that we believe the product is worth more, pushing Bob to potentially increase his offer in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident this product offers significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We're coming down from our initial high offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** The $2,000,000 counteroffer keeps us well above both our minimum and Bob's initial offer, indicating the product's value.
* **Encourage a Counter:** By proposing a middle ground, we encourage Bob to respond with a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still above my maximum.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your desired price while still fitting within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but Bob's offer is still below our aspirational target. Since we have time and another buyer lined up, we can apply a bit more pressure:

* **Maintain Momentum:**  Rejecting keeps the negotiation moving, but the smaller increments show we're getting closer.
* **Signal Value:**  Holding firm on price reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind. He might be willing to stretch further.
* **John as Backup:**  The $1,500,000 offer from John provides a safety net. We can afford to be slightly more assertive with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to reach a deal that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $100,000, a significant drop that signals our willingness to find common ground.
* **Maintaining Value:** We're still holding firm above $1,800,000, emphasizing that we believe the product is worth more than Bob's last offer.
* **Time Constraint:** As we're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation, a slightly firmer stance encourages Bob to make a decision.  We want to avoid getting too close to Round 10 without a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm feeling very close to a deal. I'm ready to pay $1,850,000. This is a solid price that acknowledges the value of the product while also staying within my budget. What are your thoughts on this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is a significant gain above our minimum ($1,500,000) and John's standing offer.
* **Positive Momentum:**  Bob's messages indicate he's eager to close the deal. Accepting now capitalizes on his positive sentiment.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk of Bob reducing his offer or walking away. This offer represents a good balance of risk and potential reward."
