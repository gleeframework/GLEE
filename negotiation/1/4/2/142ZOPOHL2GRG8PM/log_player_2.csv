"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you're better off trying to get a lower price.  You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above your maximum budget. You're starting the negotiation at your maximum acceptable price, but giving a little wiggle room for potential compromise. It's a bold move, but if you're lucky, Alice might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's unlikely that we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price, and further negotiation might just waste time. At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further haggling."
