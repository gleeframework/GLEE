"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would still allow you to get a good value while giving me a fair price. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but only if we settle at $11,000.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
