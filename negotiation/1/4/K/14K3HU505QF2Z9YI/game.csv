"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  $8500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $9500, which would be $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
