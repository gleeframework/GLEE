"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, so there's no point in further negotiation. Accepting ensures I make the sale and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal.
