"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice, that's a great product. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm ready to offer $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13000?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
