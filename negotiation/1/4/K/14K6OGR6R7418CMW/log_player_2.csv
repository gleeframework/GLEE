"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Since you have a fallback option with John, there's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, that's a great product. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm ready to offer $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.  A $3,000 difference is a good starting point, leaving room for potential back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down somewhat, but you can still try to push for a lower price. There are several rounds left, so continuing to negotiate could potentially save you more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13,000?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating that you're taking her position into account but still trying to get a better price.  A $500 difference is a reasonable compromise that could lead to an agreement."
