{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price. I'm not willing to sell for $75, but I might be willing to go down a bit.  I'll use the next round to see if I can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is a bit below my target price of $80, but it's still a good deal, and I'd rather sell to him than John for $80.  It's always better to have a satisfied customer than to go with the sure thing.  I'm hoping Bob will be happy with the deal, and maybe even become a repeat customer!"
