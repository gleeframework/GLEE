"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We want to anchor the negotiation high, significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a premium price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" we're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value without revealing our bottom line.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob's perspective and setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Important:**  While we have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, it's too early to settle. We can get a much better deal with strategic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob immediately jumping to our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) suggests he likely values the product more than his initial offer implied. We have room to negotiate upwards and shouldn't settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the immense value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Conciliatory:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly reiterate that it's too low. By using phrases like ""significantly undervalues"" and ""true worth,"" we reinforce the product's high value.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a substantial concession from $2,250,000 to $2,000,000.  This shows flexibility but avoids a drastic drop towards Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** We're still emphasizing the value proposition without explicitly revealing our bottom line, encouraging Bob to move closer to our target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still feel that $2,000,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I hope this is a price that aligns better with your expectations and remains within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to pay more than his initial offer.  We're still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate further. We want to test Bob's upper limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, we make a smaller concession of $100,000, signaling that we're reaching the higher end of our acceptable range. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  By highlighting it as a ""fair offer,"" we subtly put the onus on Bob to move closer to our price.
* **No Further Justification:** We've already emphasized the value proposition. Now, the focus is on the price negotiation itself. 

We're getting closer to a potential deal, but we still hold a strong position. We'll see how Bob responds to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,850,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is significantly higher than John's offer and represents a substantial profit above our minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the gains are likely to be small.  Bob's increments are decreasing, suggesting he's nearing his upper limit. 
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in our negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures a great deal without the risk of Bob walking away.  

It's time to close the deal and secure a very profitable outcome!"
