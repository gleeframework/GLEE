"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $70 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $82? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $79? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",79.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $85. At this price, I'm still making a profit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Alice,5,
