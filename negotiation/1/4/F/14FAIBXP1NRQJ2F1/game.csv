"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the potential benefits you stand to gain.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer reflects. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential returns you'll see.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I've tried to be flexible, but I have another buyer who's offering closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one final opportunity: $1,400,000, and that's my absolute best offer.  It's a fantastic deal for you, but if we can't agree, I'll need to move forward with my other buyer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit skeptical about the product's value. Can you meet me at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,8,
