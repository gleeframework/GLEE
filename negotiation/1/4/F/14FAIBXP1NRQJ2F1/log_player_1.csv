Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the potential benefits you stand to gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Bob's offer is far too low. While his counter is expected in a negotiation, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss. It's time to steer the negotiation closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While his offer is slowly increasing, accepting $900,000 would still be a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer reflects. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is increasing, but very slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a significantly better deal with him in the remaining rounds. We risk leaving a lot of money on the table if we continue with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I've tried to be flexible, but I have another buyer who's offering closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one final opportunity: $1,400,000, and that's my absolute best offer.  It's a fantastic deal for you, but if we can't agree, I'll need to move forward with my other buyer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit skeptical about the product's value. Can you meet me at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Bob has reached his maximum price, and it's unlikely he'll go any higher.  Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of money. John's offer guarantees the product's full value to us, and it's not worth risking that for potentially small increases from Bob."
