"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its benefits, I'm offering it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are 9 rounds left to potentially lower the price further.  Buying from John is the worst option since it's the highest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate the value you see in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he's making a significant counteroffer.
* **Strategic Discount:** A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer shows Bob's seriousness while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:**  $12,000 is still above Alice's minimum value, giving her incentive to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price of $13,200 is fair for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice has come down in price, but Bob is still in a good position to negotiate. There's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's preferred price.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, and buying from John at $15,000 is not an option right now.
* **Continuing the Process:** By rejecting, Bob can continue negotiating and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,200 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,800, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob is increasing his offer by $800, showing a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  Bob emphasizes that his offer is a ""good compromise"" to show a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Closing the Deal:** Bob is signaling that he's serious about acquiring the product, but wants to close the deal at a price that is beneficial for him."
