"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $140 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you at $115. It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
