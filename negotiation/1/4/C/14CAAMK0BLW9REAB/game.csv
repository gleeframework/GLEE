"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
