"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $12,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but how about $12,400?  It's just a small adjustment from my last offer, and it brings us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",12400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, and $12,200 is getting very close.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,300? That way we both get a little closer to what we want. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",12300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12,300 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",12200.0,Bob,8,
