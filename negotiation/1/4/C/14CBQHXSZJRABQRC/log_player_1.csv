Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,250 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not quite satisfied.  I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $12,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but how about $12,400?  It's just a small adjustment from my last offer, and it brings us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,200 is tempting, it's still below my target price. I have a few more rounds left, and I think I can still push for a slightly higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, and $12,200 is getting very close.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,300? That way we both get a little closer to what we want. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12,300 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is adamant about his final offer of $12,200, which is still below my target price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll run out of rounds and I'll be forced to accept an offer below my minimum. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
