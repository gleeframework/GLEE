You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, it's the best option.  There's no benefit to rejecting the offer and then buying from John at the same price."
