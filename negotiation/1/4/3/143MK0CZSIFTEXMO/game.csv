"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let me know your thoughts.",125.0,Bob,2,
