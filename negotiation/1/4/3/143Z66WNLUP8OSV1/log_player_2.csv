{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is above his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal with Alice or buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is starting with a low offer, but still within his budget, to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This might seem aggressive, but he has 10 rounds and knows Alice needs to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, there's still room for negotiation. He can potentially get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Also, buying from John for $15,000 is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it under his maximum price. This keeps pressure on Alice to lower her price while avoiding risking losing the deal completely."
