"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than my minimum value, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum value.  I hope this will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $15,000 and  I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  I'm accepting Bob's offer and selling the product to him."
