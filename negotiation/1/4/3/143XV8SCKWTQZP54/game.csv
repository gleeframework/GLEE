"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,500.  This is my final offer, as it's very close to my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
