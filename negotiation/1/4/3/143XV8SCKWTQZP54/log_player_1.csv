Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than what Bob values the product at ($15,000), so he has room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's room to increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more.  

By starting at $14,000, you can see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, or if you need to negotiate further. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I cannot accept that offer as it would result in a loss for me. While $12,000 from John is not ideal, it's better than selling to Bob at a loss.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering is essential:** Bob's offer is too low, but I don't want to walk away yet. Counter-offering shows him I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle:** My counter-offer of $13,000 is halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, subtly implying he's getting a good deal even at $13,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's closer than his previous offer, it's not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe there's still room to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,500.  This is my final offer, as it's very close to my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stressing this is my final offer to show Bob that we're nearing the end of the negotiation. This creates a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($11,500). 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options (John) if he doesn't accept this offer. This subtly increases the pressure on him.

By offering $12,500, I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my minimum. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely have to accept John's offer to avoid losing money."
