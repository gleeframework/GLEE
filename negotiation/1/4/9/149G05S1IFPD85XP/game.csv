"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its worth to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a serious offer reflecting a willingness to find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement.  However, we're still quite a ways apart on price. To be frank, I need to see the numbers move closer to my original ask for this deal to make sense for me.  I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
