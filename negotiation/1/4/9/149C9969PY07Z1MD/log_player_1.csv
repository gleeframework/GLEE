Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable. My price for it is $1,100,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some wiggle room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic message sets a positive tone for the negotiation and may make Bob more inclined to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By leaving some space between my offer and my minimum acceptable price, I allow for potential counteroffers from Bob. 

This strategy allows me to try and maximize my profit while staying open to negotiation. I'll be ready to counter any offers from Bob, or to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

While I could accept his offer and move on, my goal is to maximize my profit. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $950,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still give you a great deal on a product you know is valuable, and it would be a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows I'm willing to be flexible but still protects my interests.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that this price is still a great deal,  making it more enticing. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I maintain a friendly and open tone to keep the negotiation positive and encourage a deal.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable option while remaining close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping for a quick resolution at this point, but if Bob rejects again, I'll have to carefully consider my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I understand that we are not yet aligned on the price, but I would like to remain open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while keeping it within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I have to weigh the following:

* **Potential Loss:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rejections and potentially a lower price or no deal at all. 
* **Time Factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more time and energy I invest with no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **Certainty:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price, and it avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical and practical decision at this point. While it's not my ideal price, it secures a sale and minimizes potential losses."
