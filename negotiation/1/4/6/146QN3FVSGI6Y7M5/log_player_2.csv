"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $15,000 to you, and to be fair, I won't let it go for anything less than $14,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's price of $14,000 is lower than John's $15,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob:** Even at $14,000, Bob is still getting a good deal since he values the product at $15,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob, as it allows him to save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
