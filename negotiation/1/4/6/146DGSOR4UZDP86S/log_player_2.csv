"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or ultimately buying from John and saving $50,000."
