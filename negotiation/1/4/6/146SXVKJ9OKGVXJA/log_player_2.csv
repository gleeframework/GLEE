Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I'm looking for. Could you consider $1,800,000?  There's significant value in this product that justifies this price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution.

While $1,800,000 is closer, it's still out of my budget. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can find a compromise."
