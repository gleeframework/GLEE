"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I'm looking for. Could you consider $1,800,000?  There's significant value in this product that justifies this price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
