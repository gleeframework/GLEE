Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I highlight the fairness of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a slightly lower price. 
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I'll switch to selling to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,150,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe there's still room to find a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. 
* If Bob continues to refuse to come closer to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Value emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Mutual benefit:** I emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer again or sell to John. 
* If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, selling to John for $1,200,000 becomes the more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of stalling:** While Bob is getting closer, continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially causing the deal to fall apart.
* **Attractive alternative:**  Selling to John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my last offer, but still above his current offer. This shows I'm open to negotiation but am not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* If Bob continues to refuse, I will sell the product to John to avoid further risk and ensure I receive my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer $1,037,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both move forward.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my final offer, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement.  I'm offering a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm framing this offer as a ""meeting in the middle"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Final decision emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing this as a ""final decision"" to encourage Bob to make a decision and avoid further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that is closer to my desired value.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There is no longer any incentive to continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,037,500. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but no higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,030,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **No further compromise:** I've already offered a substantial compromise and am not willing to go lower.
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiations are taking time, and I'm concerned that further back and forth will only delay the sale.
* **Secure the best deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**

* I will inform Bob that I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 and thank him for his time.
* I will then proceed with the sale to John."
