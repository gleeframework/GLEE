"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer $1,037,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both move forward.  Let me know your final decision.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,037,500. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but no higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
