"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident in its potential to bring you a significant return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I need to stay within that range.  It's a fair price, considering the value I see in the product.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
