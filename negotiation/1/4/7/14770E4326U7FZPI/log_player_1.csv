Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I need to stay within that range.  It's a fair price, considering the value I see in the product.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000 valuation and avoids the risk of Bob stalling negotiations further."
