Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000. I know this is a unique item that you're interested in, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes our potential profit if he accepts.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $19,000 offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** By framing the price as ""fair given its value,"" we subtly imply that the product might be worth even more than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  We don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. A very aggressive initial offer might turn him off.
* **Market Knowledge:** We assume Bob doesn't know about John's guaranteed offer. If Bob knew about John, our negotiating position would weaken. 

This offer balances risk and potential reward. It gives us the best chance of maximizing profit while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept."
