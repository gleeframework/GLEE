Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price, and it gives Bob room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get as close to the $1,500,000 value to Bob as possible, but I want to leave some space for negotiation. I can always lower my price if necessary, but I want to start high to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It allows me to secure a sale without risking a further reduction or a protracted negotiation process."
