Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $975,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1 million, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting his offer of $925,000 secures a substantial profit over John's standing offer of $800,000. It's always better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it by pushing for too much and potentially getting less later."
