"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued, $900000 is a bit out of my comfort zone. I'd be willing to consider a price of $750000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",815000.0,Alice,5,
