Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, making it seem like a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $900,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving room for potential counteroffers and compromise. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and allowing for a possible deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me is $800,000, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This still allows you to gain a significant profit while ensuring I get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000. 
* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can still potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable agreement.

While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of a higher price with Bob. The potential for a better outcome through continued negotiation justifies rejecting Bob's offer for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our potential partnership, I can't accept $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still offers you a good deal while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's true value. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and highlighting the fair deal my offer represents. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, potentially leading to a successful negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. However, given my valuation and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a price of $900,000, which is closer to your initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and lead to a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks that he might walk away, leaving me with only the $1,000,000 offer from John. 
* **Mutual benefit:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a deal and provides a significant profit for me, while also allowing Bob to acquire the product within his budget. 

Given the potential for a stalemate or a lower price from John if I continue negotiations, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option."
