"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This allows me to maximize potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so a high starting offer could incentivize him to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell at that price. I'm hoping to get more, and I'm confident I can with a counteroffer.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profit greater than my minimum. If Bob accepts, it's a good deal. If he rejects, I'll have more information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. I've already been through two rounds of counteroffers and his offer is getting lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  $15,000 is my minimum, and I'm not going to risk losing even more money trying to negotiate with Bob."
