"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John, so any offer above that is not worth accepting.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is still lower than John's price but is closer to Alice's potential profit.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, you can still get it cheaper from John. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're not willing to overpay.  It's a slight increase from your previous offer, which might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97 is only $3 more than John's price.  You've already rejected multiple offers and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation.  It's not worth risking another round, as you might not get a better deal."
