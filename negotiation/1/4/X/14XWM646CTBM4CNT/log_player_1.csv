Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but I also want to make the sale to Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $19 in value ($100 worth to him - $119 price = -$19, a negative loss means a gain).
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell it to John for my minimum price."
