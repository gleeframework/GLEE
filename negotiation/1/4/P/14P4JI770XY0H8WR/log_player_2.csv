"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit too high for me though. How about $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value for the product ($100). This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Polite and Positive:** I want to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more.  $115 seems like a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a range I'm thrilled about. I think there's room for her to go a little lower, and I'm willing to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $110 would be my limit. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price while still trying to stay under my ideal budget. 
* **Setting a Limit:** By stating my ""limit"" (even if it's not entirely true), I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious about this price and unlikely to go much higher. 
* **Remaining Flexible (Slightly):**  There's still a tiny bit of wiggle room if Alice completely refuses $110."
