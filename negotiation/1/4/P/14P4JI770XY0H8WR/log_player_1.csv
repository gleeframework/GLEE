{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation, recognizing that Bob values the product at $150.
* **Friendly message:** Starting with a friendly and open tone helps establish a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning that Bob might ""really love"" the product subtly emphasizes its value to him.

This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still securing a decent profit for you. If he rejects it, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $100 if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit too high for me though. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit low considering the product's value to him ($150). Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, you show that you are not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Potentially secure a better deal:** You can use your counteroffer to aim for a price closer to your initial offer of $130. 
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to increase his offer in the next round.

By choosing to reject Bob's offer, you are strategically positioning yourself for a potentially more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more.  $115 seems like a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  I'm offering $115, which is a compromise from my initial $130 but still above Bob's offer of $105. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to come closer to my desired price. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while also maximizing my potential earnings.  If Bob is serious about buying the product, he might be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for countering, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $110 would be my limit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my last counteroffer of $115, and it's significantly higher than what John is offering.  

Here's why accepting is the best strategy:

* **Profit:** While it's not the ideal price I initially hoped for, it still yields a decent profit ($10 more than selling to John).
* **Minimizing risk:**  Further negotiations might not result in a higher price, and there's always a chance Bob could back out completely.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting the offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities.

Ultimately, accepting Bob's offer balances the need for profit with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
