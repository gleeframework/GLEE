Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 aims to maximize profit. This price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Below Bob's Perceived Value:** The offered price is still below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, making it an attractive proposition for him. 
* **Alternative Buyer Strategy:** By having John as a backup buyer, you have a strong fallback position. This allows you to confidently negotiate with Bob, knowing you won't be left empty-handed."
