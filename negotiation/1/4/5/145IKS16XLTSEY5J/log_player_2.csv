"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $13,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $15,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value, and I hope you'll consider it.

Alice's offer is now $15,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.  Accepting the offer is the best option as it meets Bob's price limit and avoids the potential for further negotiation."
