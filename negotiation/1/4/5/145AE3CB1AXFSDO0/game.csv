"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure I can afford it.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $87.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think?",87.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $87 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",82.0,Bob,6,
