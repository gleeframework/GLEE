Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the gesture, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
