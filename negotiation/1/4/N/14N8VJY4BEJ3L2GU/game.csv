"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the gesture, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
