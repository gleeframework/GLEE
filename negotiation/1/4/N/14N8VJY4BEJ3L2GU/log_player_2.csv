"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.  It's better to try and negotiate further to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the gesture, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still below your maximum price of $1,200,000 and is closer to your ideal price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away or counter with a higher price.  Accepting this offer saves you money and secures the product."
