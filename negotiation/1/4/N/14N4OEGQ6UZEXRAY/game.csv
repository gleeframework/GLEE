"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",750000.0,Bob,4,
