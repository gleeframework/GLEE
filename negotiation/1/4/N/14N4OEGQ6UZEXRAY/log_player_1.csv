"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach our $800,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, making it the safest and most profitable option at this point."
