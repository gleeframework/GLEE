"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a significant investment. Could you tell me more about the product and its potential benefits to my business? I'm interested, but I need to understand its value better before committing. To show my interest, I'm willing to consider an offer of $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $500000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident this product will generate substantial returns for your business.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product has value, but I need to be sure it aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $650000?  This price reflects the potential I see in this product while allowing me to make a responsible investment.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  It's truly unique and has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $750000? This price allows you to invest in a potentially lucrative opportunity while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's make this deal happen.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $750000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant. To make this deal work, I need to be confident that the product's value justifies the investment. Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $700000? This price reflects the potential I see in this product while allowing me to make a responsible investment.  I'm open to hearing any final thoughts or details you might have about the product.",700000.0,Bob,6,
