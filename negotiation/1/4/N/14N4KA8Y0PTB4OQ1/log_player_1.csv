Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price ($1,700,000) because I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate. 

Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value of $800,000, especially if he sees the product as valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring counter-offers to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,400,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility, but maintains a profitable margin for me. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below $1,500,000. It's time to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
