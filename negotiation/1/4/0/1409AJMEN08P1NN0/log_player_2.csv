(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$8,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in trying to negotiate a better price.  We have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary.  We'll see how Alice reacts to this aggressive opening."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still above my target price. I believe there's more room for negotiation. I'll continue to make counteroffers, pushing for a lower price while keeping the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price below $7,000.  This is a strategic move to signal that I'm serious about buying from Alice, but not at an unreasonable price.  We'll see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and $7,200 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing this deal completely. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with while still leaving some room for potential savings in the future. It's a good balance of getting a good price and not risking the opportunity."
