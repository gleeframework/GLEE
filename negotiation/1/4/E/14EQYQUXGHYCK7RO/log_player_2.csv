"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great opportunity to purchase a high-quality product. I believe you'll love it! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's ideal budget of $8,000. There's room for further negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can offer it to you for $10,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's ideal budget of $8,000. There are still three rounds left, and Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. It's not time to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting the feeling we're both serious about making a deal. I'm going to raise my offer one last time to $9,750. If you're willing to meet me halfway here, I think we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation. If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he risks Alice making a counteroffer that is even higher, making it less likely he can get a better deal.  While $10,250 is a slight improvement over Alice's previous offer, it's still well above Bob's ideal budget and only one round remains. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and secure the best possible price within his budget."
