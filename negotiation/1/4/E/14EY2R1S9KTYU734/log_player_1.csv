Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  To make it work, I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate the reduction in price, however, I am still unable to meet the $17,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would this be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his valuation of $12,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best way to maximize my profit in this scenario."
