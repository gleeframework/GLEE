"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He wants to save as much money as possible, and $11,500 is still more than his target of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the initial offer, he's still paying more than his target of $12,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to come away satisfied with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,200 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he's still paying more than he wants. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his desired price.  The longer he negotiates, the more likely Alice is to reduce her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $11,200 is closer, but I'm really only comfortable at $10,900. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to come away with a win.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be fair to myself. I can offer you a price of $11,400 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's now in a position where it's more advantageous to buy from John.  While Alice has come down a bit in price, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He's already rejected several offers and there are only 3 rounds left. It's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice to come down to his target price in that time.  Since John is offering a price that's only slightly above Bob's target, it's the most logical choice."
