Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be more likely to accept a price closer to his own valuation if I start high and work down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's closer to my initial asking price of $100.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer or the need to sell to John for $80."
