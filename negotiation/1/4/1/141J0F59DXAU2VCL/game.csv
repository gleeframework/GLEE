"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm initially offering it at $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  It represents a significant investment on my part, and I can't let it go for less than $18,000. I'm confident you'll see a strong return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product represents an investment, but I'm afraid $18,000 is still beyond what I can justify. Could we meet in the middle at $14,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
