"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. I'm interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? ",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to work with you, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a sweet spot. How about we meet at $950,000? This is a good compromise that gets us closer to your target, while still being fair to me.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $750,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we settle on $875,000? This is a fair price that balances our interests and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,7,
