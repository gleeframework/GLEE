"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $15,000."
