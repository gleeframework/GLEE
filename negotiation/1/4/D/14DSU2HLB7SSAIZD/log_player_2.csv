"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 by you. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional item at a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant savings compared to the market value. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this unique opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product. She claims it's worth $15,000 to me, but I've set a maximum budget of $15,000, implying it's not worth more than that.
* Her offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000. 

By rejecting this offer, I can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a much better price."
