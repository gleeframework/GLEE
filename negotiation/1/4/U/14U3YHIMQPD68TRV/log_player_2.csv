"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than the $120 John is charging, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $108, and that's my final offer on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $108 is still within Bob's budget of $120, and is a better deal than buying from John.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her ""final offer,"" suggesting further negotiation might be futile.
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

It's a good deal for Bob, and accepting minimizes risk."
