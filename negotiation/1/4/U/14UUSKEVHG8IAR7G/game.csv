"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $925,000? This would give you a great deal and still allow me to get a fair price for the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can go up a bit. Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $900,000.  This would be a fantastic deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,5,
