"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
