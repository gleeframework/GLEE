"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $14,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, and Bob can always buy from John for $12,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and set a starting point for bargaining.  It's a reasonable move considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and he wants to save as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue trying to get a better deal, especially since he has the option to buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product. Offering $12,500 is a strategic move. It's a compromise, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while keeping his offer under his maximum budget. This might also put pressure on Alice, who may be more inclined to accept to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
