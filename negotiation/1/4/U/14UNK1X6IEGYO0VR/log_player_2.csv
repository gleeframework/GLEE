"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice is trying to convince Bob with a ""great deal,""  it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Bob can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best financial decision."
