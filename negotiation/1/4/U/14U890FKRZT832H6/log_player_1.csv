Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** While not ideal, $12,000 is still a significant profit over your minimum and John's offer.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's message suggests he's nearing his upper limit. Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time:**  We're past the halfway point, and there's no guarantee a better offer will come from Bob."
