Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  While he is showing a willingness to negotiate, the increments are too small to reach a price that is acceptable to you. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final price."
