Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering the product at $9,000 allows for potential negotiation downwards while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning your own perceived value of $10,000, you create the impression that Bob is getting a deal, even if it's above his perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential willingness to pay a premium over his perceived value if he believes he's getting a good deal."
