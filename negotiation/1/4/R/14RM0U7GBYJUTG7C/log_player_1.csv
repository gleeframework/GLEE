"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth at least $120 to me. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially see the value in the product. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $100 is a significant discount from my minimum, showing I'm open to negotiation but still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to make at least $120, and Bob's offer of $90 is still below that. 
* **Negotiation Space:** While I could accept and get some profit, there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired amount and see if Bob is willing to compromise further.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** By rejecting, I keep the negotiation open and might be able to secure a higher price later.  There's always the possibility that Bob will offer more, or I might be able to convince him to pay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll still find this product a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth of a slightly higher price. 
* **""Split the Difference"" Strategy:** This common negotiation tactic can make the offer feel fair to both parties. 
* **Maintain Profit:** $95 is still above my minimum of $120, allowing me to maintain a profit while keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I can't go above $90. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While $92 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has increased his offer.  There's a chance he might go higher if I continue to push. 
* **Time for a Counter:** I can use this round to make another counteroffer and try to bridge the gap further. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** If Bob won't budge, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $92 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit below my target.  Let's try $94.  This would be a fair compromise and allow both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the offer by a small amount ($2) to signal my willingness to compromise but still maintain some leverage. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" to make the offer feel more appealing and less like a demand. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I highlight how a deal at $94 would be ""good for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Close to My Target:**  $94 is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer and puts me within striking distance of a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. I'm willing to pay $93 for the product. Is this within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Bob's offer of $93 is only $1 away from my last counteroffer, and it's within my range of acceptable prices.  
* **Time Constraint:** We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiations, and it's getting closer to when I can sell to John. I need to make a decision soon. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd ideally prefer $94, accepting $93 guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I reject this offer, I risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower profit."
