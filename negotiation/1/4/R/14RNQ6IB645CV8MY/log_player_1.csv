"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This serves two purposes:
    * **Anchoring:** It sets a high anchor point for the negotiation. Even though it's likely to be rejected, it influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
    * **Room to Negotiate:** It provides ample space for me to make concessions, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal later on.

* **Positive Language:** I keep the tone positive and focus on the product's benefits (""great product"", ""perfect for you""). 

This strategy aims to:

1.  **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob, by some chance, accepts this high initial offer.
2.  **Set the Stage for Negotiation:**  Guide the conversation towards a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is a tempting offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's interested (""I'm interested in the product"") but trying to position the price closer to his perceived value. By rejecting and countering, I can try to nudge the final price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming up. I'm willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer (""thanks for the offer"") and make a significant concession by dropping $2,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This common negotiation tactic frames the new price ($20,000) as a fair compromise, even though it still leans more towards my desired range. 
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** The language remains amicable and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Signal Willingness to Deal:**  While I'm not accepting $18,000, I'm showing Bob I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm still above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer, giving me leverage in further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $19,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested in the product and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting $19,000 makes sense at this point for a few reasons:

* **Significant Profit:** $19,000 is a $4,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price and a good return.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. The potential gain from further negotiation is likely small compared to the risk of losing the $19,000 offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations, allowing me to move on to other opportunities."
