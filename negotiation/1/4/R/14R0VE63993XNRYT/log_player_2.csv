"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to say that $900,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I have to say that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

This seems like the time to accept.  Alice is clearly drawing a line, and while we could try to push for another $50,000 off, we risk her walking away.  This deal saves us $450,000 from John's price, which is significant."
