Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $135. I think you'll find it's a steal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By positioning the price as a ""great deal,"" we aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can always fall back on selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
