"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $120, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $120, which is $140. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",140.0,Alice,5,
