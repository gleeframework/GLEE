"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? That's my absolute maximum.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $12000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you, and this price allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $13500. How about we split the difference and go with $12750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
