Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, giving Bob an incentive to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering at $15,000, you signal flexibility and open the door for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during the negotiation if Bob shows resistance, but don't go below your $12,000 minimum."
