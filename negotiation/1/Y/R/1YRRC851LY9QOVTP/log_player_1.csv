Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob while also establishing my starting point.  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit. 
* **Initiate negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can see how far he's willing to go and adjust my strategy accordingly.  
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $15,000. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to:

*  **Test Bob's willingness to negotiate:** If he rejects my counteroffer again, I'll need to consider selling to John.
* **Maximize my profit:**  I'll try to reach a price that's closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $10,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer of $12,000 but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise while staying firm on a price that's closer to my minimum valuation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Show flexibility:**  By reducing my offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Test Bob's sincerity:** If he rejects again, it shows he's not serious about buying.
* **Set a limit:** $10,000 is still a good profit for me, but if Bob won't budge, I can sell to John for $15,000."
