"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely do better. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500. How about we settle on $8,750? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than the product is worth to her ($8,000).  You can still get a better price, so it's worth continuing the negotiation.  You know that Alice is willing to negotiate, and your goal is to get the price as close to your maximum budget as possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway in your last offer. However, $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to split the difference again. How about we settle on $8,625? This price is closer to what I can afford, and I think it would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8625}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,625. How about we meet you halfway between $8,750 and $8,625? That would put the price at $8,687.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,687.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,687.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,687.50 is still a bit higher than the product is worth to her ($8,000), but it's very close to my maximum budget of $10,000.  The negotiations have gone back and forth several times, and it's likely that Alice is close to her bottom line.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a price that is still advantageous for me."
