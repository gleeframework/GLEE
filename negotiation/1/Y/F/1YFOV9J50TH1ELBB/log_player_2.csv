"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $9,500. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than both her value and John's offer. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the opening offer, Alice. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still aiming for a price higher than your ideal. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer. We're getting close to the point where John's deal is looking more attractive. We need to push Alice a bit harder."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm on a tight budget. I can go up to $9,100, but that's really my limit. If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 9100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,300? It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, but Alice is still trying to hold onto a higher price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can push her closer to $9,000. If she rejects this next one, it's probably time to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close. This is a great product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can do $9,200, but that's absolutely my final offer. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9200
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $9,500? I know you said $9,200 was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a chance and see if we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice is stuck at $9,500.  She's unlikely to go any lower. At this point, cutting our losses and going with John's offer of $12,000 is the best choice. We've spent considerable time negotiating, and further haggling with Alice is unlikely to yield a better outcome than John's offer."
