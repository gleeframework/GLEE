"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $9,500. Is this something you'd like to consider?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the opening offer, Alice. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm on a tight budget. I can go up to $9,100, but that's really my limit. If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,300? It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",9300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. This is a great product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can do $9,200, but that's absolutely my final offer. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're really close, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $9,500? I know you said $9,200 was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a chance and see if we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Alice,9,
