Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's incredibly valuable and I know it can do great things for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** Your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (John's offer).  
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Finding a middle ground:** You want to offer a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum to incentivize him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing you a price higher than his initial valuation while still securing a sale. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit by potentially getting a price higher than John's offer. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you always have John as a guaranteed backup."
