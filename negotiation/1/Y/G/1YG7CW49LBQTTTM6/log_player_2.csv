"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at the same price, you have no incentive to accept her offer immediately. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options."
