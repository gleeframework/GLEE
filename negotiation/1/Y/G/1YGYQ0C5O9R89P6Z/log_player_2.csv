"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,125,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $1,125,000. Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $125,000."
