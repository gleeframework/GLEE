Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're still significantly above our minimum price, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is a little too low for me. How about we settle on $975,000? That's my final offer."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could try to push for a bit more, $960,000 is a strong offer and well above our minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation falling through entirely."
