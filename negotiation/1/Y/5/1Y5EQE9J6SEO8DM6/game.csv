"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this unique product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we compromise at $700000? This is a great opportunity to own a unique product, and I think it's worth every penny.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this unique product, but I need to make sure it's within my means. Can you consider a price of $650000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $650000 is a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $675000? This is a great opportunity for you to own a truly one-of-a-kind product, and I think it's worth every penny.",675000.0,Alice,5,
