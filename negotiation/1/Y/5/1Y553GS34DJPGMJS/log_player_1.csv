Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies its value, making a higher price more palatable.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly signal that Bob might lose out if he doesn't act, even though you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is crucial. By being polite and asking for Bob's thoughts, you encourage a dialogue rather than a flat rejection.

While there's a chance Bob might reject the initial offer, it sets the stage for further negotiation. You can always lower the price slightly if needed, but starting too low limits your potential gain."
