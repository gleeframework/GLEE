"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a fantastic price considering the value the product brings you. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $975,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
