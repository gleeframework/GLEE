{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter. I'm hoping to get closer to the $15,000 value it holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not satisfied with that price. It's worth more to Bob, and I can likely get closer to the $12,000 mark with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to the value you see in the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,500,  $9,750 is a good deal considering that I'm still making a profit and it's significantly better than selling to John. It's also a good sign that Bob is willing to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price."
