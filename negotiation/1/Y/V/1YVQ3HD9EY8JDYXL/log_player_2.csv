"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high.  There's no reason to accept it when you can get the same product from John for half the price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as you might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with the price I know I can get from John, as this establishes my absolute maximum price.  It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this on the first counteroffer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,500,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what John is offering. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer by a reasonable amount,  showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a good deal.  This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's most recent offer, so it feels fair and might lead to a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down in price, but it's still above what I can get from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as we are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher.  I believe that this counteroffer is close enough to Alice's offer that she might be inclined to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While this is still a higher price than I'd like, it's getting closer to my desired range.  We're now in the 7th round, and with limited rounds remaining, it's becoming more likely that Alice will be unwilling to go lower.  Given that John's offer is $1,000,000, this is a reasonable price to accept for a faster deal."
