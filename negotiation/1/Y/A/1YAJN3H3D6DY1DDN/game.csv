"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm prepared to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm seeking, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let's make this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
