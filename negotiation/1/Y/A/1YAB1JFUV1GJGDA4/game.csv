"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $125, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That seems like a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is tight.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's the absolute most I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, and I'm willing to work with you.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",100.0,Alice,5,
