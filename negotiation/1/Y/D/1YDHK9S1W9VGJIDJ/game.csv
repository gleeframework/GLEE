"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is worth $10000 to you, but I believe its value is even higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product, but that's as high as I can go.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $13000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $13000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $1000, which will give you additional benefits and support. So, the total value you'll receive is $14000. I'm confident this is a fair and attractive offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
