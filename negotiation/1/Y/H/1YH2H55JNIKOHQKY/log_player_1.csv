Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product. This price still offers a significant profit for you and is more in line with my budget.  I'm open to discussing this further.
