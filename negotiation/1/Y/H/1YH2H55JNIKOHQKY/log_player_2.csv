As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
