"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product. This price still offers a significant profit for you and is more in line with my budget.  I'm open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. This price still represents a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm proposing $875,000. This would be a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $887,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
