Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000.  This is a significant investment for you, but I'm confident it will deliver exceptional returns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. While we are moving closer to a potential deal with Bob, there's room to negotiate further and see if we can secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $2,025,000? This represents a significant compromise from my original price, demonstrating my willingness to make this deal work."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we are still above John's offer, Bob's offer is getting close to our minimum acceptable price. The increments of his counter-offers are getting smaller, suggesting he may not go much higher. Accepting at $1,900,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer."
