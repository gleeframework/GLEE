Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to the product's value to me ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  I know Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer guarantees I can sell the product for at least $120.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a perceived ""deal"" while maximizing my potential profit. 

This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
