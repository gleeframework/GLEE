"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I can see you're serious about this, so I'll meet you at $1,500,000, but only because I know I can sell it to John for that price if we can't agree.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
