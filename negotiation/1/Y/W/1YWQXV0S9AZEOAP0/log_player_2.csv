"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, you have no incentive to accept her offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future or explore other options."
