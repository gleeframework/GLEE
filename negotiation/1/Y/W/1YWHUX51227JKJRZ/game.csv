,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I can see you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about my own costs. How about we meet at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you at $132, which is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",132.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that $132 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $129. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $150.",129.0,Bob,10,
