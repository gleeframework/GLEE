Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value for the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see value in this product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000. I will counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm countering with $16,500. This is a fair compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also willing to be flexible to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value for the product, and I'm confident that we won't be able to reach a better price with further negotiations. Accepting his offer will secure the sale and save time, which is valuable."
