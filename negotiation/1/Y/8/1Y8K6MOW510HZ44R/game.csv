"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a concession to work with you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
