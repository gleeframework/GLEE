"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal.  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your maximum of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. Considering your offer of $950,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.
