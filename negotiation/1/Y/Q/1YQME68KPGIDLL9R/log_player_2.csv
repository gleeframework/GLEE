"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($80). This means there's room for negotiation and a potential to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to do $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $87 for the product. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $87, which is very close to my ideal price ($85). It's a good compromise and a better deal than buying from John for $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my offer and potentially going back up to $90 or higher is too high. Accepting the current offer secures a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
