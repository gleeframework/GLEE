"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
