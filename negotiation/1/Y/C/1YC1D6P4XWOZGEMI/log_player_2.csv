"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$60 is a great price, but I'm trying to save as much money as possible.  Since I have 10 rounds, I'll see if I can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to incentivize Alice to negotiate further. I'm aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $50, which is still a good deal considering my maximum budget is $150.  I'm happy to accept this offer and save $100 compared to buying from John."
