"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still more than the product's value to Alice. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to the product's value to Alice ($8,000). A counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and only slightly lower than her first offer.  This suggests Alice is not overly eager to sell at a lower price. However, Bob still has room to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice makes more sense than buying from John at a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to stay within his budget. $8,750 is a mid-point between his previous offer and Alice's last offer, potentially making it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking to her price, and it's clear she's not willing to come down significantly.  Bob has already made two counteroffers and seen Alice reject them.  While there are still 5 rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will budge enough to make the deal worthwhile for Bob.  At this point, buying from John for $12,000, although not ideal, is the better option to avoid further wasted time and potential frustration."
