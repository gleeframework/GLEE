"Alice, your product seems very interesting, but the price of $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its potential value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects its market value and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
