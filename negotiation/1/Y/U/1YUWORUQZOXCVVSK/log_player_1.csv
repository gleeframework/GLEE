Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems very interesting, but the price of $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its potential value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects its market value and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
