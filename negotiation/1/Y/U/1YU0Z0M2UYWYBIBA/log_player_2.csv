"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think a price of $14,000 is fair given its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm thinking $12,500 is a more realistic price considering my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm looking for a price closer to $13,500. This product offers significant value, and I believe that price reflects its worth more accurately. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.**
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.** 
* **While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the offer and ultimately make the deal with John for $15,000.** 

It's a calculated risk to accept the offer, but the potential savings make it the most reasonable option."
