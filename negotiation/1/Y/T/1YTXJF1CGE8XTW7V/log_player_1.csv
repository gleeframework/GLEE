Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $145 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your own valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still ensuring you get more than his perceived value of $100.
* **Direct Approach:** The message is straightforward and avoids being overly salesy, focusing on Bob's potential interest."
