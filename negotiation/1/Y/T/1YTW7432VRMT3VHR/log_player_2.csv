"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than what John is asking, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counteroffer process, potentially lowering the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you consider $10,500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still better than the $12,000 price from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy at the higher price from John. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price Bob is comfortable with."
