We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are getting lower.  Since I'm only one round away from having to accept John's offer of $10,000, it's time to cut my losses. I'll sell the product to John for $10,000,  which is better than selling it to Bob for a price below my minimum threshold."
