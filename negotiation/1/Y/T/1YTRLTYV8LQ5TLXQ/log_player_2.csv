Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than $1,500,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 more rounds, and a chance to get the price down closer to his $1,200,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer.  He wants to get as close to his maximum price as possible, while still being within a range that might be palatable to Alice.  A $100,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant move, and hopefully will prompt Alice to consider a further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1360000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his target price.  He's offering a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's. It's a reasonable compromise that hopefully shows Alice that he's serious about getting a deal done, but also doesn't give away too much. He's hoping this will entice Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally met Bob halfway, offering a price that's only $5,000 above his target. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  If Bob rejects this offer, he might not get a better one, and he could end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's time to secure the deal."
