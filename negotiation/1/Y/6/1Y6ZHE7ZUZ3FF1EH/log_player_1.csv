"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, and this offer gives him an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise. I want to avoid getting into a long, drawn-out negotiation, but I'm still determined to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Although $8,500 is just a little over my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, Bob might walk away and I'll be stuck selling to John for $8,000. I'd rather secure a sale now and have some profit than risk getting nothing."
