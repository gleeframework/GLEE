"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This price reflects the unique benefits it offers and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains substantial.  To be transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase the product at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would benefit you greatly.  Therefore, I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,400,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my sincere desire to reach a deal. Let me know your decision promptly.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
