Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This price reflects the unique benefits it offers and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains substantial.  To be transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase the product at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would benefit you greatly.  Therefore, I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,400,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my sincere desire to reach a deal. Let me know your decision promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above John's offer of $1,000,000.  Her mention of another buyer and a ""final offer"" suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.  It's in your best interest to secure the product at the best price, even if it means walking away from the negotiation with Alice."
