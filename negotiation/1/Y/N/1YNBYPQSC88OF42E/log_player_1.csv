Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and also gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  It's a compromise, but still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping to meet Bob in the middle, but I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my price."
