Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're getting a profit over what John would pay.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value:**  This gives Bob a strong incentive to buy and still allows him a good deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize your chances of selling to Bob while getting a higher price than John would offer."
