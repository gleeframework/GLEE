"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see how much room we have for negotiation.  While it's above his perceived value, it's not an unreasonable starting point, and it gives me some room to come down in future rounds. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that I have a backup option (John) willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a loss. I have a backup option (John) who is willing to pay my minimum.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue negotiating to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer that reflects my true value for the product.  John is willing to pay this, so I'm not willing to go lower without strong justification."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not there.  I have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to settle for less at this point. I'll continue negotiating in the hopes of getting a better offer from Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a slight concession to Bob by coming down to $950,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway, but I'm still staying above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final offer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  We've been going back and forth for a while, and it's unlikely he'll budge much further. I have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John."
