Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm showing flexibility, but also holding my ground. This price is likely more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I make a good profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering the price further, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob while ensuring a good profit for myself.  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to get closer to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to push for a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, but still one that's below my minimum."
