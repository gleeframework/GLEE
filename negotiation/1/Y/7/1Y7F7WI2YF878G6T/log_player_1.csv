I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a healthy margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $1,300,000, which is still a reasonable profit for me while being a bit closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation with him.  I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
