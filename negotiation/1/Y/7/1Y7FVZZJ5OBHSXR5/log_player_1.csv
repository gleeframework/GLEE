Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and shows you value the product. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything less than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes there's no significant cost associated with delaying the sale to negotiate with Bob."
