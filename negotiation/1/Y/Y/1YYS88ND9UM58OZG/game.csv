"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1100000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to consider my other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
