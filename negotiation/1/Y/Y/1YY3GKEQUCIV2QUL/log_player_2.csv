"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the product for the absolute lowest price possible. He knows that John will sell the product for $12,000, so this is his ideal price.  Offering $12,000 is a bold move, but it's the best chance for Bob to save the most money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not willing to budge on her price. While $13,000 is a slight improvement, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price of $12,000.  Further negotiation with Alice would only risk delaying the purchase and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
