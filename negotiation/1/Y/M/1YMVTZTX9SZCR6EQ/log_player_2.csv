"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $800,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It also leaves room to increase the offer later if needed.
* **Signaling Interest:** Explicitly stating interest in the product shows Alice that a deal is possible and encourages her to counter. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup option at $1,000,000 gives us leverage.  Alice knows we have an alternative, even if we don't explicitly mention it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I'm looking to keep this purchase closer to the $1,000,000 mark. Would you consider an offer in that range?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal Budget (Partially):** By mentioning a $1,000,000 target, we're subtly revealing our upper limit without completely showing our hand. This can encourage Alice to make a more substantial move.
* **Gauge Flexibility:** This offer will help us understand how much Alice is truly willing to negotiate.  If she flat-out refuses, we know there's little room to maneuver.
* **John Remains an Option:**  We're still prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice won't budge."
