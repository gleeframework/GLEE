Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's maximum ($80). This sets the negotiation in my favor.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer instead of walking away.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to consider a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls. I'll be ready to counter Bob's offers,  keeping my minimum price in mind, and always considering the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my target price. 
* **John is a safe option:**  John offers a guaranteed $100, which is my floor. If I can't get a better deal from Bob, I can always choose to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still allows for some negotiation. I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95? That's still a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning for price:** I'm providing a reason for my price, highlighting the value to Bob.
* **Staying above minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum of $100, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is appealing to Bob while still maximizing my profit.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to go lower or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited negotiation room:** While I'm open to negotiation, there's only a small difference between Bob's offer and my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a long and unproductive process.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John provides a guaranteed $100, which is my floor and a safe alternative. 

**Strategy:**

It's important to be pragmatic.  While I want to get the best possible price, it's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation with Bob, especially when I have a guaranteed offer from John. Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids further potential losses."
