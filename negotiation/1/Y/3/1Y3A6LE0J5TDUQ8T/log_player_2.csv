"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to your operations.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price in subsequent rounds. 
* **John's offer is a backup.**  You can always go to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I understand this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her perceived value of $800,000. This shows you are serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on budget:**  Highlighting your budget constraints can create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to consider your offer. 
* **Open to compromise:** The message ends with a positive tone, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This price still offers you a significant value proposition, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** It's closer to your budget, but you can likely still get a better deal.
* **Negotiation continues.** There's room to close the gap further. 
* **John's offer remains a fallback option.** You have a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a good deal.  Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates your willingness to find a solution.
* **Appeal to fairness:** Highlighting ""fair price"" for both sides emphasizes a win-win scenario. 
* **Urgency:**  Suggesting a ""meet halfway"" approach creates a sense of urgency to reach an agreement."
