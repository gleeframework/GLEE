"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for what I had in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront - $1,200,000 is cutting it too close. Let's make this work - how about $1,350,000 and we have a deal?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
