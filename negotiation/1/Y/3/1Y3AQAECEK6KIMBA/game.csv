"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
