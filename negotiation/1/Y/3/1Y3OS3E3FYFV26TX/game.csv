"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given my own assessment of the product's value, I'm offering $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 falls significantly short of reflecting the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm proposing $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This reflects my assessment of its value, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ my absolute minimum for this product is $800,000. I'm happy to leave this offer on the table, but I also have other interested buyers. I believe this product is truly valuable for you, so I hope we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Alice,5,
