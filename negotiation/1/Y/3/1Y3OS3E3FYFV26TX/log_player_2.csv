"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to buy from John, and Alice's offer is far too high. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given my own assessment of the product's value, I'm offering $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 falls significantly short of reflecting the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm proposing $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go above my maximum price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This reflects my assessment of its value, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ my absolute minimum for this product is $800,000. I'm happy to leave this offer on the table, but I also have other interested buyers. I believe this product is truly valuable for you, so I hope we can find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's the same as John's offer. There's no reason to continue negotiating since I can get the product at this price now."
