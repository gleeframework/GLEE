"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round. I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  $175 is a good compromise point, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I'm only $10 away from my minimum price, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations and losing out to John is too high.  I'd rather secure $140 now than risk getting less or nothing."
