"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Given its value to me, I would like to propose a price of $120 for you to consider. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of the product at a reasonable price while also allowing me to recover a significant portion of its value. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget.",120.0,Alice,1,
