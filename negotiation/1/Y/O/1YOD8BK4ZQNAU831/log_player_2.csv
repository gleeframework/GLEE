"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. While that's a good deal, you can get it from John for $150, which is still within your budget.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer and buy it from John."
