Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for a product you'll truly benefit from."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $150. Offering it slightly below his perceived value increases the likelihood of a sale while maximizing your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reinforcing the idea that the price is justified.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a profitable sale with Bob and having the safety net of selling to John for your minimum price."
