Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,875. I can offer it to you for $10,125. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $10,125 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000 price, and further haggling risks annoying Alice or reaching a stalemate."
