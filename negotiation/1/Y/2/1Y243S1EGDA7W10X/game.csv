"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the value I know it holds for you in the long run.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
