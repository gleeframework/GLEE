Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the value I know it holds for you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, the offers are escalating too slowly. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that reflects the product's value to me. Selling to John guarantees I receive my minimum acceptable price."
