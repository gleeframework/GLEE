Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is far too low. I understand you're on a budget, but  I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.
