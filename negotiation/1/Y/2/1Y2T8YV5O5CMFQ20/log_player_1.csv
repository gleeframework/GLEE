Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still well above your $15,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer is not overly aggressive, allowing for potential counteroffers and a more back-and-forth negotiation.

By leaving room for negotiation, you create the possibility of reaching a higher price, while still ensuring a positive outcome for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?  I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below his own perceived value of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is far too low. I understand you're on a budget, but  I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and although it's closer to his perceived value of $8,000, it's still not a good deal for me.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $15,000."
