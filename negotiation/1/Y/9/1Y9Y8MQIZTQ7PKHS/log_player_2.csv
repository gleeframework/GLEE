"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and John is selling the product for that exact amount, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice. There's no potential for saving money, and you risk wasting time in negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
