Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $6,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $9,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is presenting this as her ""final offer,"" there are still rounds of negotiation left, and we're getting closer to my target price. It's worth seeing if she'll come down a bit further, even though she claims $9,000 is her bottom line."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $8,000.  Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
