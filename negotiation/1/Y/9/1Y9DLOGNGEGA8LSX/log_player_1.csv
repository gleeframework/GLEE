Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $6,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $8,000.  Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below your $9,000 threshold.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob not meeting your minimum price, and you'd lose the guaranteed $8,000 from John. At this point, accepting John's offer is the most logical choice to secure the best possible outcome."
