"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth that much to you. If you're interested, let me know! Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Even though Alice is offering the product at the same price John is, Bob can still reject the offer.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $120, there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer.  This strategy allows Bob to potentially get a better deal if another seller emerges with a lower price."
