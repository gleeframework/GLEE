Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $20,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe its value will become apparent over time."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and even your minimum ($15,000) sets a high anchor.  While this price is likely to be rejected, it gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Justification for Premium:** By framing the product as a ""premium"" offering, you create a perception of higher value.  You're not just selling a product, you're selling exclusivity or a unique advantage.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussion, which could lead Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet closer to your desired price range.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy is risky. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer without countering, leading you to John's offer.
* You need to be prepared to justify the high price if Bob engages in negotiation. 
* Gauge Bob's reactions carefully. If he seems completely turned off by the initial price, you might need to adjust your strategy quickly."
