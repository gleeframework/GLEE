"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe your starting price is a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $900,000."",
 ""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($900,000) allows for room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my maximum budget. 
* **Gauging Alice's Position:** This counteroffer will give me a better understanding of Alice's bottom line and flexibility.  If she accepts, it's a great deal. If she counters, we can start working towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice decreasing her offer by $70,000 shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** The new price is still $80,000 above her value, leaving space for further negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm comfortable continuing negotiations since I have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000 if needed."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To move this forward, I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This demonstrates my seriousness in making this deal work."",
 ""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** I'm raising my offer by $75,000, a substantial jump that shows I'm committed to finding an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts us closer to the middle ground between our initial positions.
* **Time Consideration:** With rounds passing, I want to make noticeable progress towards a deal without conceding too much too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Alice is now suggesting splitting the difference, which can be a tactic to close the deal quickly. I want to see if I can push for a better outcome.
* **Still Above Value:** While $1,025,000 is a reasonable price, it's still $25,000 more than Alice values the product for.
* **Time Remaining:**  With five rounds left, I have some room to negotiate further and aim for a final price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last two offers. How about $1,000,000 even? This reflects a fair price that acknowledges both the product's value and my desire to close this deal today."",
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:**  My offer of $1,000,000 is precisely what Alice values the product for. It's a strong position that's difficult for her to refuse without potentially losing the sale.
* **Splitting the Difference Tactic:**  By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm using a common negotiation technique to make my offer seem more appealing and reasonable.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""today"" subtly introduces time pressure, encouraging Alice to make a decision quickly rather than prolonging the negotiation."
