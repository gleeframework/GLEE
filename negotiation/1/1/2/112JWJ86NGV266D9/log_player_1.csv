I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my goal in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable point. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has come up to $1,100,000, which is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away, or I might have to sell to John for less than what I'd like.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
