"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential compromise.

**Strategy:**

I want to start negotiations by setting a high price, but I'm also being realistic. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum value. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll keep adjusting my offer based on his counteroffers, always keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a profitable transaction. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price higher than his initial offer but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by mentioning a ""fair price"" and ""profitable transaction"".
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a message that conveys willingness to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. By reducing my price significantly, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to come closer to my acceptable range.  I'm also using language that emphasizes collaboration and finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not ready to settle for a price that undervalues the product.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for negotiation. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the importance of finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial asking price.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to his initial offer but still above his most recent offer.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my counter-offer by mentioning a ""significant compromise"" and ""true value"".
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage further discussion.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. By offering a price of $800,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about finding a solution but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
