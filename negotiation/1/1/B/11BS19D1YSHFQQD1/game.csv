"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a profitable transaction. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial asking price.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
