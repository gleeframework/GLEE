"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $9,750 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,250.",10250.0,Alice,5,
