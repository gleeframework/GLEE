"Bob, I understand your position. While $10,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  This gives you a significant saving compared to my initial price, and it's a price I can accept. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
