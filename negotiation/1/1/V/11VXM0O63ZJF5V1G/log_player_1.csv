Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet the minimum price of $12,000.  Continuing the negotiation is likely a waste of time and carries the risk of Bob offering even less. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
