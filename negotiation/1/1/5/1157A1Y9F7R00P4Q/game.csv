"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product. Let's split the difference and go with $9,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's fair.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
