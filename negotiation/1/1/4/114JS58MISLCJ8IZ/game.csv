"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which would be $9,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. $9,250 is closer, but I'm still needing a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $9,400 to make this work.  It's a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",9400.0,Alice,5,
