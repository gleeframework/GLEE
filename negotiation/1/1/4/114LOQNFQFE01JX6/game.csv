Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10000.  This is my absolute maximum. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is your maximum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $10000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
