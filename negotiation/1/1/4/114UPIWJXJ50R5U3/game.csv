"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value this product highly, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? This price still allows me to achieve a significant return on my investment, and it's a reasonable compromise given the value you'll receive. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm confident this product is worth more than you're currently offering.

This price reflects the true value of the product and allows me to recoup my investment.  I hope we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1000000.
