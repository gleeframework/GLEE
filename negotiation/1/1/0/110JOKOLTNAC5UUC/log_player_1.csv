Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This allows for a healthy profit margin for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and $1,000,000 undervalues it considerably. I could consider a price of $1,200,000.
