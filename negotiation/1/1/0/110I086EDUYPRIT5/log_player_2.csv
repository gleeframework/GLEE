{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You know the product is worth $100 to her, so there's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I think the product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Alice is still offering more than you're willing to pay, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get her down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little high for me.  Let's try $110 - that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $112.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

Alice has come down to $112.50, which is still a good deal considering your maximum budget is $120.  It's worth taking this offer."
