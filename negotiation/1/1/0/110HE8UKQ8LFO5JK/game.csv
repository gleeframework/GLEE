"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe $1,500,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  How about we settle on $1,900,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
