Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. My offer is significantly higher, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.
* **Leaving Room:** My offer leaves a considerable gap for potential counteroffers. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's $1,500,000 offer, which serves as my safety net. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still below it.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can potentially push for a higher price, as Bob is showing interest.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance I can get closer to that with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a profitable deal.
* **Gap for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for potential further negotiations.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I'm confident I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:**  Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired amount and avoids further time and energy invested in a potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob. 

I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed sale with John, as the likelihood of securing a higher price with Bob is diminishing."
