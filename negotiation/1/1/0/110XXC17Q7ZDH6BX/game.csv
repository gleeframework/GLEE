"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the potential returns it offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
