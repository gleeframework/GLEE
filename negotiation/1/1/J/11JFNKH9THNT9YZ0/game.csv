"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we start the conversation a bit lower,  would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While $600,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Could you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a substantial reduction on my part, while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we are still quite far apart.  To be frank,  $1,900,000 is not a price point I can meet. Would you be open to something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm committed to reaching a deal with you. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This represents a significant concession on my end while recognizing the inherent value of what I'm offering.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but are still a ways off from a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
