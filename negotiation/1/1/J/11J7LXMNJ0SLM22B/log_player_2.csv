Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we compromise at $110? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $120 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to get the price down, but you also need to weigh your options. You might be able to negotiate lower with Alice, but the price from John is a safety net. If you can't get Alice down to $100, you might need to go with John.  Rejecting the offer gives you one more round to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not there yet.  If you're willing to come down to $100, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting close to your limit, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your desired price point, and you only have 3 rounds left.  Given that you're willing to pay $120 from John, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation. You're guaranteed a better price with John than what Alice is currently offering."
