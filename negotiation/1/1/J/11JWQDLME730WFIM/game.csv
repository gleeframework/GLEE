"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable for you.  My initial price is $17,000, reflecting the premium value I know it holds.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $17,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering you a price of $14,000.  This price still provides me with a fair return while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's keep the conversation going.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, and I see that we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's settle on $13,750.  This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me to achieve a fair return.  What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to that price. Can you meet me at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I'm trying to be as accommodating as possible. However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,600, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.  What do you say?",13600.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,600 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,300. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",13300.0,Bob,8,
