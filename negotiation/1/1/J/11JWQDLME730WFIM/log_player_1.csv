Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable for you.  My initial price is $17,000, reflecting the premium value I know it holds.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $17,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000,  it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I believe I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering you a price of $14,000.  This price still provides me with a fair return while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a price that adequately reflects the product's value. I believe there's room for further negotiation, so I'll counter his offer. It's not yet time to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, and I see that we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's settle on $13,750.  This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me to achieve a fair return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to that price. Can you meet me at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is only $250 below my last counteroffer, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum price. I believe I can push for a higher price, and I don't want to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I'm trying to be as accommodating as possible. However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,600, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13600}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,600 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,300. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I don't want to risk going any lower, and I also don't want to risk another round of counteroffers that might end up with a lower price. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the best option at this point."
