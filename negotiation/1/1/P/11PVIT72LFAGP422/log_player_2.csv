"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. There's room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $9,500, but it's still above Alice's minimum selling price of $8,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial willingness to pay, it's still above his desired price.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice. He's still in a good position to reach a lower price.  He can continue to counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000. This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer of $9,700 and his previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price that acknowledges both parties' needs and leaves room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay, but it's still not a great deal for him.  The negotiation seems to be stuck, and Alice might be unwilling to budge further.  Considering that Bob can buy the product from John for $12,000, it's a better option to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John."
