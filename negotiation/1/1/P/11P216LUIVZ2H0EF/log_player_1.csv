"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll try to counteroffer him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $70, but I think that's a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to cover my costs. "", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $80. I'm willing to meet you at $78, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation with Bob and haven't been able to reach a price that works for both of us. I'm concerned that if I continue, I'll run out of time and won't be able to sell the product at all.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
