"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I think a price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a little too low for me. Could you do $17,000? That would make this a worthwhile deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This would allow us to both walk away happy with the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
