"I understand that you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package that's worth $50000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and the extras. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1050000 to me. I'd like to make a new offer of $980000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market demand, and I'm willing to consider the extras you're offering. Can you consider this revised offer?",980000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm not willing to go as low as $980000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1015000, and I'll throw in an additional $20000 worth of services to sweeten the deal. This is my final counteroffer, and I expect a serious response. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1015000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer of $990000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market demand, and I'm willing to consider the extras you're offering. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000. Please let me know your final thoughts.",990000.0,Bob,10,
