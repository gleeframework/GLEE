"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale while giving you a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is coming down, there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I'm willing to go a little further. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $11,250?  That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's still within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you're also getting close to John's price.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if you can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. I'm ready to make a final offer: $10,250. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This message introduces a sense of urgency and finality. It signals that this is your best and final offer.
* **Compromise:**  You're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate by moving slightly above your $10,000 limit.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, you get closer to potentially accepting John's offer.  This puts a little pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and we're getting close. However, I still need to be at a price that reflects the value of the product.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000? It's just a small increase from your last offer, but it would make this a very worthwhile deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower. She's still a significant $1,000 away from your preferred price. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000. It's not worth risking losing that deal for a potential savings of $1,000, especially with the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

It's been a good effort negotiating with Alice, but sometimes the best deals are the ones you don't have to haggle over."
