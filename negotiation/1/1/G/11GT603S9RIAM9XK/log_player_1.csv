Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also shows my belief in the product's value.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While selling to John for $12,000 is an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and is higher than John's offer.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can find another buyer if this deal falls through."
