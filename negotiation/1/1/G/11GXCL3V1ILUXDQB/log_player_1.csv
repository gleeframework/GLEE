I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This gives him a potential profit of $200,000 if he resells it, which is a good incentive. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, and I'm willing to negotiate with Bob to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not aiming for the absolute maximum price, I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives Bob a decent profit margin, and it's a more reasonable price than his initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as it's a good compromise."

Bob is not budging much from his initial low offer. I'm starting to feel that I'm unlikely to get a price that is significantly better than John's offer. To avoid further negotiation and potential loss, I'll sell to John."
