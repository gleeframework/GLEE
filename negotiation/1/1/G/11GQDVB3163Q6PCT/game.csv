,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. Can you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think this deal isn't going to happen.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000. If you're serious about this, this is our last chance. If you reject this offer, I'm going to sell to John.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
