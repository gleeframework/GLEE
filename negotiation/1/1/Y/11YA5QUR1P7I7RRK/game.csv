"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $950000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, which I think is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that the product will be worth it to me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which is closer to my minimum price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe the product's value to you is clear, and I'm confident that you'll see the benefits of investing in it. My revised offer is $900000.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept to make the deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but I'm not budging further. My revised offer is $920000.",920000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower than $920000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can finally meet on a price.",915000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet on a price, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $918000, which is very close to my minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. My revised offer is $918000.",918000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $915000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not sure if it's worth it for me. I'd like to discuss this one last time before making a decision.",915000.0,Bob,10,
