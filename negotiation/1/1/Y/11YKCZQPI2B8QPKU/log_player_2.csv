"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my best offer considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showcasing my serious intent to purchase. 
* **Fairness:** $1,100,000 is still a good profit for Alice, considering her value of $1,200,000. This price allows for potential negotiations but avoids being too low and risking her rejecting it outright. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for future negotiations, allowing us to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value.  While I understand your offer, I'm still confident in the original asking price. To move things along, I can come down to $1,400,000. I think this is a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my budget. I'll continue to negotiate to see if I can reach a price closer to my $1,000,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows for further bargaining."
