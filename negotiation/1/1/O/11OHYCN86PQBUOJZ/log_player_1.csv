"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  It's a bold move, but if Bob is truly interested, he'll likely counter. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is a good profit, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe I can get a better price.  It's worth taking the risk and seeing if I can push for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  $19,000 is still a solid profit for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is only $500 below my previous offer. I'm getting close to my goal, and it's risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance he could counteroffer again, and I might end up with less than $18,500.  I'd rather secure this decent profit than risk it all."
