"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your position, $1,300,000 is a significant gap from where I see the true value of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I'm confident this price reflects the unique advantages this product offers.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
