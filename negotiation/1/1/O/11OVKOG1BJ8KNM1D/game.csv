"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $25,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $25,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your initial offer.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $20,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $15,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and it's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.  I'm confident we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,
