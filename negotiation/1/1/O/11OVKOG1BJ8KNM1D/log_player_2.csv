"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $25,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $25,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* **Justification:** He's not just throwing out a random number. He's justifying the price by mentioning the product's value.
* **Open to negotiation:** He's ending with a question to encourage continued discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $20,000 is a step down from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, especially if she wants to close the deal before Bob decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $20,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $15,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and it's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.  I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** Bob is now sticking closer to his budget but framing it as a fair offer. 
* **Emphasis on value:** He's reminding Alice of the value she herself has highlighted to justify the price.
* **Closing statement:** Bob is making it clear that this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice to make a decision."
