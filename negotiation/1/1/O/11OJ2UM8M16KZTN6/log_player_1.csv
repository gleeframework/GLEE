"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point because it allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob while still securing a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my desired price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. It's better to close the deal now and secure a profit than risk further negotiation with Bob or opting for John's offer, which is only slightly higher."
