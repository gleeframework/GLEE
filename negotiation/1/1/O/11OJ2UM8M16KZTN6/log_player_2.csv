"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no reason to accept the offer at the full price. By rejecting the offer, you open the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal, but the risk is low considering you can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($1,500,000) forces Alice to consider a more substantial price reduction. This sets the stage for further negotiation, and we can adjust our counteroffers based on Alice's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your target.  Continuing to negotiate offers the potential to secure an even better deal.  You have 7 rounds left and can still fall back on John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Our counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a significant step closer to our initial offer of $1,000,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation. This is a reasonable compromise that may be acceptable to Alice, while still achieving some savings."
