Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than the absolute minimum you're willing to accept. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's still a ""deal"" compared to your guaranteed sale price to John ($150).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still profitable for you.

**Important Considerations:**

* You need to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* A lower offer is more likely to be accepted, but a higher offer yields more profit if Bob accepts."
