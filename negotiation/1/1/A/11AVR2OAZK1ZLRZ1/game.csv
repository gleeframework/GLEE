"Alice, your product looks great, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $9,800.  I think that's a fair compromise, and it would save us both some time.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try $10,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
