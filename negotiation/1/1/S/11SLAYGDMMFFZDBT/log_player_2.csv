"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

# Alice's message: I understand you have other options, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $950,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation, as exceeding the $800,000 budget is not desirable."
