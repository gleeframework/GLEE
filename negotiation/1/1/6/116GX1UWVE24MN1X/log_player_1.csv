{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while ensuring we don't leave money on the table. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" subtly implies the price is justified.
* **Alternative buyer:**  Hinting at other interested parties (""list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Clean and direct:** The message is easy to understand, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

While this initial price is ambitious, it's balanced with a clear understanding of Bob's valuation and the presence of a backup buyer (John). This approach aims to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
