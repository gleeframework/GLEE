It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to go much lower. She's sticking close to her $1,200,000 starting point and has made it clear that $1,150,000 is her bottom line.
* **Time Constraint:** We're down to the last couple of rounds.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to us losing the deal altogether, forcing us to buy from John at the much higher price of $1,500,000.
* **Reasonable Price:** While $1,150,000 isn't our ideal price, it's still significantly less than our maximum budget and a decent saving compared to John's offer. 

Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of overpaying later."
