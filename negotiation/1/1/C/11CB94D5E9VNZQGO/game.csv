"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to the higher end of the spectrum. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This price reflects the product's value to you and allows me to get a fair deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
