"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as you could potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I can meet you in the middle at $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $112.50** which is still within your budget of $150.
* **You've already rejected a lower price ($105)**, so it's likely Alice is firm on that point.
* **Accepting the offer saves you $37.50 compared to buying from John.** 

While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
