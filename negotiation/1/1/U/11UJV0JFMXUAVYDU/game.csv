,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $19,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment, but I need to stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,4,
