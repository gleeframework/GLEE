# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $9,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $8,500?  That would leave us both with a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
