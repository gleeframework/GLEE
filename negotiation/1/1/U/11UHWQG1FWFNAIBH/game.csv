"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $9,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $8,500?  That would leave us both with a decent profit.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.",8750.0,Alice,3,
