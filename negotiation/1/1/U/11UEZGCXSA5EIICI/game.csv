"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
