"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the true value of the product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
