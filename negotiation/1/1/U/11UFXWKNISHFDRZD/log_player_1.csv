Round 2

Round 4

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated this is his final offer and he's unlikely to move significantly higher.  While $1,190,000 is a decent price, it's still below your fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000.  At this point, the risk of Bob walking away and the potential for further haggling isn't worth the small potential upside. Accepting John's offer guarantees a solid price and avoids further negotiation."
