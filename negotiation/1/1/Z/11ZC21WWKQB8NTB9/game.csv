"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $140.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. It's the best I can do at this time.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $140, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
