Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to still potentially make more than selling to John. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Observing Bob's reaction to this offer will be crucial. If he seems hesitant, a slightly lower follow-up offer might be strategic."
