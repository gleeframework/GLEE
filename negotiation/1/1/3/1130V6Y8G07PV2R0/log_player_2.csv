"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to negotiate a price lower than the initial offer, but he still needs to be realistic.  $12,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice. This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation while showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my original price.  Would you consider $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money and he can still get a better deal. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to her. Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to continue negotiating and possibly reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise. He's raising his offer slightly, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway. Offering $12,500 indicates a willingness to close the deal, putting pressure on Alice to accept.  It's a reasonable price for both parties, and it keeps Bob within his budget."
