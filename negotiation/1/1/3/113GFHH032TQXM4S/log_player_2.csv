Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems like Alice isn't willing to budge much further.  To avoid potentially going through another round and still not getting a good deal, it's best to take the guaranteed price from John.  $10,000 is our limit, and this will ensure we get the product within our budget."
