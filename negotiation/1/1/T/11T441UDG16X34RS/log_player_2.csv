# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000. 
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the effort.** You've already successfully lowered the price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000.  There's a chance you could get it lower, but it's also possible Alice could refuse your counteroffer, leaving you with no deal and needing to buy from John at a higher price. 

It's a good deal for you and saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
