{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value.  This allows for room to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer, while still securing a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your desired value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price to see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
