"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your desired value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
