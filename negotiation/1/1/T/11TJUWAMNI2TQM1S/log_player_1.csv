Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.
