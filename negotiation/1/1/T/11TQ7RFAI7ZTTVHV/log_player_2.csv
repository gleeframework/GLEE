"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $1,000,000.
* Alice is offering it for $900,000. 
* John is offering it for $1,000,000. 

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than your maximum value. You can get the product for your maximum value by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
