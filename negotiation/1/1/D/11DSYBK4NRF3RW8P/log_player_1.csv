Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a bit of a gamble. It's higher than what John is willing to pay, but it's also significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob.  Here's the logic:

* **High enough to incentivize Bob:**  $950,000 is still a great deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000. He'll make a $50,000 profit if he buys it.
* **Low enough to leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob is hesitant, there's still room to negotiate down slightly.  It's better to start high and potentially compromise than to start low and leave money on the table.
* **Protects you from losing out:** If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $800,000, ensuring you don't lose out completely. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
