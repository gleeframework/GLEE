Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 1.1 million?**  This price is a compromise. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Strategic thinking:** 
    * I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also need to consider the possibility of Bob rejecting my offer. 
    * By offering a price close to his value, I increase the chances of him accepting, while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary.
    * If he rejects, I can then gauge his seriousness by his counteroffer. 
    * If he's not willing to budge much, I can confidently walk away and sell to John."

* **Why reject Bob's offer?** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Strategic thinking:** 
    * I'm confident in the value of my product and the possibility of a better deal.
    *  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further.
    *  This opens the door for a counteroffer that could potentially get me closer to my desired price. 
    *  If Bob doesn't increase his offer significantly, I can confidently sell to John, securing my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 1 million?**  This price is a compromise between my initial offer of 1.1 million and Bob's offer of 900,000. 
* **Strategic thinking:**
    * I'm trying to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me but might be more appealing to Bob.
    * By making a counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
    * If Bob still rejects, I can move closer to John's offer or walk away if his final offer isn't high enough."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why sell to John?**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I can get from John.
* **Strategic thinking:** 
    * It's clear that Bob isn't willing to pay the price I'm seeking. 
    * By selling to John, I guarantee my minimum acceptable price and avoid potentially losing more time and effort negotiating with Bob. 
    * It's important to recognize when a deal is good enough and not risk settling for a lower price just to avoid walking away."
