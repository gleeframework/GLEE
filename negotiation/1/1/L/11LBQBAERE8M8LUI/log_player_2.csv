# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Here's how to decide:
