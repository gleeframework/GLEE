Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Value Extraction:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so we don't want to risk losing Bob entirely by starting too high.

**Important Note:**  This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating style or any time constraints. In a real-world scenario, those factors could influence the initial offer."
