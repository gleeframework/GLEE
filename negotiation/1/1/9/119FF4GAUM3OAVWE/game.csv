"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. Would you be willing to go down to $98?",98.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $98 is still below my minimum.  To show my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to go down to $99. This is my final offer, I hope you'll consider it.",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $99. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $98 and $99. Would you consider $98.50?",98.5,Bob,8,
