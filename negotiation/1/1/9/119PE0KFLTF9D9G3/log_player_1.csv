Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup buyer at $120, guaranteeing you meet your minimum price."
