"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $900000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  How about $1050000? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1050000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $950000. It's a fair price that's closer to our respective values. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is closer, but I need to be at least $1000000 to make this work for me.   Let's meet in the middle at $1000000 - this ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
