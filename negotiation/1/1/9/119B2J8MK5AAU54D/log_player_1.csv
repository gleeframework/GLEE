{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $10,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum value, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential savings for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This offer starts the negotiation process. By offering a price lower than my minimum, I'm opening the door for a potential deal while still aiming for a profitable sale. If Bob rejects, I can continue the negotiation or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's still a good deal for me, but I'd like to save a bit more money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also below my initial offer of $10,000, showing a lack of willingness to meet me halfway.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal.  I'll need to make a counteroffer, but I'll aim to stay closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $9,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly but firm, acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing that I'm not willing to go too low. I'm also offering a ""good deal"" for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still keeping the negotiation close to my minimum acceptable price. By emphasizing the value to Bob, I'm hoping to get him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I've shown flexibility, Bob's counteroffer is very close to his perceived value of $8,000. This suggests he's not willing to negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a price significantly below my minimum, it's more advantageous to sell to John at $12,000.  This ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of a lower price or a prolonged negotiation."
