"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a little profit.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $89 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $89 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $88. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I don't think I can go any higher.",88.0,Bob,6,
