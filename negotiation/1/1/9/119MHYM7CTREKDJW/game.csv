"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. How about $8,625?",8625.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,800. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",8800.0,Alice,5,
