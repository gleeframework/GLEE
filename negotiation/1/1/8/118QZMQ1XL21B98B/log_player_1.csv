"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession. How about we settle on $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and will allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to move forward with the deal.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,250 is closer to my goal than the previous offers, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I believe we can find a mutually acceptable price in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob and I are at an impasse, and I've already given him my final price.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk losing the deal entirely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While this isn't ideal, it's better than potentially walking away with nothing."
