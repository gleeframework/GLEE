"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering the rarity of the product. However,  $12000 is a bit higher than my budget allows right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $11500. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit stretched with $11500. How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? I believe that's a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal for $11800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,5,
