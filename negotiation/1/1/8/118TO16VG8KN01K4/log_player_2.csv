"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering the rarity of the product. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $11500. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her original price, $11,500 is still a bit high for my target price.  I'm willing to risk another counteroffer to try and get closer to my goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit stretched with $11,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I believe that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal for $11800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,800, which is very close to my target of $10,000. It's unlikely she will go lower in the remaining rounds, and $11,800 is a good deal considering the uniqueness of the product.  It's also a significant savings compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
