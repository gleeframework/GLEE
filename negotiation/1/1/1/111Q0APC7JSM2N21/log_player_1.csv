I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still too low for me, and I have time to negotiate further."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is not budging much on his offer, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and get the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
