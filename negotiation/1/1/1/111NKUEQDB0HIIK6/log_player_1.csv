Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Starting High:** I start with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always lower the price slightly or simply sell to John for my guaranteed $150."
