"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I believe its value to you will be significant, given your unique needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
