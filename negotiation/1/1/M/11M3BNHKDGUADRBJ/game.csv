"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. It offers unique advantages that I'm certain will benefit your business substantially.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product, which is a 5% discount from your latest offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I respect your approach. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm proposing  $1,600,000. This reflects the true value of the product and keeps our deal moving forward.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,575,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I'd like to continue negotiating with you.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
