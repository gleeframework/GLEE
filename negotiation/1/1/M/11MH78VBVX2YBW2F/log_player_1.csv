Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:** $9,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but less than what it's worth to you. This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants to. 
* **It's a clear message:** The offer is easy to understand and leaves no room for confusion.
* **It's open-ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond and allows for further negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a great price for the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$8,250 is a good compromise, especially considering that Bob is likely the only buyer who will give me anything close to my desired price. I'm taking the deal!"
