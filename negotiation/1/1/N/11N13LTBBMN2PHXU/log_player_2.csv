"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you're willing to pay.  It's a great deal, saving you $300,000. There's no reason to risk going to another round of negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
