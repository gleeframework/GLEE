"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Let's negotiate! Alice's offer is too high. We can try to get a better price."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable around $650,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation.  This leaves space to potentially meet in the middle while still staying well below my $800,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value it holds.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is good, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's counter again and try to nudge the price closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",

}
```

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving us some wiggle room to potentially go up slightly from $700,000 if needed."
