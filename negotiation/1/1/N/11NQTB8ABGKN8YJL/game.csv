"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable around $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value it holds.  Let's find a middle ground.",750000.0,Alice,3,
