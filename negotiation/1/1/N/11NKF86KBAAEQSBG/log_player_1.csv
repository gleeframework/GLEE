{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that's slightly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to acknowledge the value of the product to Bob in order to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$90 is a good compromise and very close to my desired price. It's better than selling to John for $80, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
