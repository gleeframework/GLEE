Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, and I'm willing to move closer to your asking price. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer matches John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher. I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
