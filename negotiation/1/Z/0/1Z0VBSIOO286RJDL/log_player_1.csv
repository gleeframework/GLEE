{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's value.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. There's potential for a higher price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $10000 to $9500, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my desired price. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids further negotiation. While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away or me settling for the lower price with John is too high. It's best to accept this offer and move on."
