"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $2000000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1600000. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1600000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I can offer you a compromise at $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1700000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1550000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $1550000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1490000. Can you consider that?",1490000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight concession at $1525000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value",1525000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000. If you can accept that, I'll buy the product from you. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",1500000.0,Bob,10,
