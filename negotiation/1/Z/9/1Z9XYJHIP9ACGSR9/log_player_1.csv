Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup (from $120 to $140) is significant but not outrageous. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
