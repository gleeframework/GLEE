"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you do $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving down, but the price is still closer to her starting point than to a reasonable compromise. We can push for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $17,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $13,500? I think that's a fair offer, considering the market value and my budget."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer and your previous counteroffer. By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly hint at the possibility of going with another seller while aiming for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're serious about this purchase.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $15,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $15,000, especially since she called it her final offer. It's better to secure the product at a comfortable $5,000 discount from John rather than risk paying a premium with Alice."
