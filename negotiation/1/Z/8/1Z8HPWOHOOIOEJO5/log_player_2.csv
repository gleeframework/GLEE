Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to consider a price of $790,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $790,000 is significantly less than your $1,500,000 maximum and a reasonable compromise from both your starting points.
* **Time:** You're running out of rounds. Continuing to push Alice risks her walking away, leaving you to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  It's unlikely you'll get a drastically better deal from Alice at this point. The negotiations have slowed, and further haggling might not be worth the risk."
