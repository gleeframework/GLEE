"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $825,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $825,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be open to $750,000?  I think that's a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to benefit.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to consider a price of $775,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $760,000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to consider a price of $790,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",790000.0,Alice,7,
