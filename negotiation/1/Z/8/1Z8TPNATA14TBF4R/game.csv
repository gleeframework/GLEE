"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe you'll find it highly valuable, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to compromise, but not quite that low. I'm willing to come down to $750000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $750000, so how about $725000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $725000, but I'd like to add a slight premium for the value this product brings. How about we meet at $730000?",730000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $730000 is getting close to my limit. I'm willing to pay $720000, but that's as low as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",720000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach your limit, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll make one more compromise. How about we meet at $725000, just like we discussed earlier?",725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I've already offered $720000 and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm afraid I'll have to pass if we can't meet at that price. I'll consider buying from John for $1200000 if we can't come to an agreement.",720000.0,Bob,8,
