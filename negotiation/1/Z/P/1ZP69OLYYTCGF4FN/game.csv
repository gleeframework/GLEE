"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I think this is a reasonable price for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree this product is valuable, $750,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $600,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
