"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference? $160 would be fair to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $160 is closer to your target, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
