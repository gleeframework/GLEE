"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to save a bit of money. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $112? That way we both get a good deal.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $108 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we settle on $110? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $110, which would be $109. Would you be willing to accept that?",109.0,Bob,6,
