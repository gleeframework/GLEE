"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you a considerable amount of money."
