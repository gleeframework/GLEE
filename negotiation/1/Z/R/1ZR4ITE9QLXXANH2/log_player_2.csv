# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a good deal considering the product's worth to Alice, it's still not in your best interest to accept. You should try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000, and it's still a great deal for you since it's below its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000.  While it's getting closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  John is offering the product at my maximum price, so it's the safest and most economical option for me."
