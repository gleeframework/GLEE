"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000, and it's still a great deal for you since it's below its value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
