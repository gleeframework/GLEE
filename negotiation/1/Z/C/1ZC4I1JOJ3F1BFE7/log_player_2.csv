"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice's offer is $2,000 over that. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a lower price, potentially reaching a deal within your budget. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  While John offers the product at your maximum price, it's still a good option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates you're serious about buying while setting a lower starting point.
* **Be polite and express interest:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  By offering a price slightly lower than your maximum, you create space to adjust if Alice counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, it's still $1,000 over your maximum budget. 
* **Further negotiation is possible.**  Alice is showing flexibility by meeting you halfway, suggesting further negotiation could get you closer to your desired price.
* **John remains a viable option.** You have the security of John's offer if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm  prepared to pay $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close the gap:**  $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, showing commitment to reaching a deal while remaining within your budget. 
* **Highlight the value:**  Mentioning the value of the product helps justify your offer and shows you've considered its worth.
* **Express optimism:**  Ending with a positive statement keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a bit from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still over budget.**  While it's closer to your target, $10,750 is still $750 over your maximum of $10,000.
* **Further negotiation is likely.** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, suggesting a counteroffer could lead to a deal within your budget.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.**  If negotiations with Alice break down, you can still secure the product from John at your desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,750 is very close, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,250. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value we've both agreed on for the product.  Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close the gap significantly:** This offer is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, showing commitment and a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  Emphasizing the fair price based on the product's value and your budget can increase the chances of acceptance.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The upbeat closing statement keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a significant amount from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still over budget.**  While it's only $500 over your maximum, you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely Alice will come down further.
* **John's offer is the best option.**  You have a guaranteed way to get the product at your desired price. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of the deal falling apart and losing the opportunity to buy from John. 

It's better to secure the product at your target price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice that might not lead to a successful outcome."
