Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you this product for a special price of $11,000. I think it could be very valuable to you, and this is a great deal. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as much as possible from the sale. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Appeal to Value:** By highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, Alice might sway him even though his perceived value is lower than the asking price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Depending on Alice's knowledge of Bob (his negotiation style, how badly he needs the product, etc.), she might adjust her approach."
