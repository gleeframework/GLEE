"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to go to $800,000, which is a significant step closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can seal the deal at that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $900,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go to $825,000, which is a strong middle ground. If you're serious about getting this deal done, I believe this is a fair price considering the added value you're offering.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $925,000, and I'll throw in an additional 6 months of premium support to sweeten the deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,7,
