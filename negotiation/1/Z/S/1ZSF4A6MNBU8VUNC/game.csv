"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get an amazing deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is interesting, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it hard to get a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $700,000.  It's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Alice,5,
