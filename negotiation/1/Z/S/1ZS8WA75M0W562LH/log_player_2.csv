"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product at a special price of $90. I know you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is under your $100 limit, you can get a better deal from John for $100. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll go lower, or buying from John as a last resort."
