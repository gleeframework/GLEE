Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product at a special price of $90. I know you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures I get a great price.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
