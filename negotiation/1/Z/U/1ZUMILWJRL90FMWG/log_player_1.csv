Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $100, creating an incentive for him to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob the impression that you're willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your initial offer of $95. You have two reasons to reject:

1. **Potential for higher profit:** You believe you can get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer.
2. **Testing Bob's commitment:**  Rejecting the offer signals that you're not desperate for a sale and willing to walk away if you don't get a better price. This could potentially make Bob more willing to negotiate.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to get closer to your target price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but are still holding firm on your value.  $90 is a significant compromise from your initial $95 but still ensures you make a profit.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"", making it less likely Bob will feel like you're being unreasonable.
* **Positive language:**  The message remains positive and friendly, keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $87.50 is still slightly lower than you'd prefer, it's a reasonable compromise:

* **Close to your minimum:**  It's only $2.50 below your minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **No guarantee of a better offer:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will budge much further. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and may not result in a significantly higher price. 

Selling to Bob at $87.50 allows you to secure a decent profit and avoids the risk of potentially having to sell to John for $80."
