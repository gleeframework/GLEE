Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you want to start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering it at $1,350,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for price:** By mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment,"" you aim to appeal to Bob's perception of the product's worth, even though it's less than what you value it for. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have a limited time frame. If you have ample time, you might try negotiating with Bob further before going to John."
