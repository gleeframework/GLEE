"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, making Alice's current offer unacceptable."
