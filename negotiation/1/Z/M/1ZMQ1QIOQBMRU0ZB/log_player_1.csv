Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below that would be leaving money on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to still secure a price significantly higher than $800,000. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

By starting high but still within a reasonable range above Bob's valuation, I maximize my chances of securing the best possible price."
