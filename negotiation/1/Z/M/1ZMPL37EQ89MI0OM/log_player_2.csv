# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price and the price John is offering.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $12,000."
