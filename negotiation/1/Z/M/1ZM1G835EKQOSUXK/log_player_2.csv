I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to secure the product at John's price of $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice sticking to her ""final offer""."
