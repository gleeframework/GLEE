"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line.",90.0,Alice,3,
