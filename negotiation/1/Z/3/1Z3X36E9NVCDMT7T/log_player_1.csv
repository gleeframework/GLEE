Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking $110 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but still lower than what John would pay. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm indicating willingness to compromise, making Bob feel like he has some control and might be more likely to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is too low. I believe there's potential for a better offer if I counter. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If this negotiation doesn't go well, I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's $65 but still below my initial price of $110. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while staying closer to my target.
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm emphasizing that $90 is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Focus on my bottom line:** I'm subtly referencing my minimum acceptable price to signal that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is closer but still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my minimum of $100. 
* **Negotiation is not productive:**  This negotiation has gone back and forth without reaching a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $100, which is my minimum goal.  It's a safer and more predictable outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
