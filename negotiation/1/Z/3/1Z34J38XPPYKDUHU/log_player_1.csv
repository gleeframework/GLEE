Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.
