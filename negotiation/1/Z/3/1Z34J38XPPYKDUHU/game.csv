"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",8500.0,Alice,5,
