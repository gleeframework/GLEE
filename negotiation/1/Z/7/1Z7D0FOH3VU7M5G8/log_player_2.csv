While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with. You can try to negotiate further."

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, it's still more than what you can get from John.  Since you have the option to buy the product for $1,000,000 from John, it's more financially beneficial to take that option."
