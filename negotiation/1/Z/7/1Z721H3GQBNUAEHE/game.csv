"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering its value. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground here.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $16,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,5,
