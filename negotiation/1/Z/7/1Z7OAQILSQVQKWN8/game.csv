"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,500,000 was a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000, which is a $50,000 discount from my initial offer. This is my best and final offer for now.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
