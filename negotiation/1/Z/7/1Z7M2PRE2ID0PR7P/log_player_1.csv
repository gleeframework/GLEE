"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's also a price that I think is fair considering the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer immediately. I'll see if I can get a slightly better price from Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135, which is halfway between my minimum and the price I initially offered.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is closer to my minimum price than my last counteroffer, and we are nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting his offer would give me a good profit, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round."
