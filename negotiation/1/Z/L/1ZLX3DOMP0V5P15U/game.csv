"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,500,000 is a little too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to accept $1,800,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
