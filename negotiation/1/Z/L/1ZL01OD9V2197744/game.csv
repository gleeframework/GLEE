"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1350000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1300000 for the product. Is this a more reasonable price for you?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $1300000. I'm willing to consider $1320000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need you to meet me there. Can you consider that price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
