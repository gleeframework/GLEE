{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. It's best to see if she's willing to negotiate lower."

Round 2

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get the price down just a bit more.  It's still worth trying for a better deal than John's $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""This is a fair offer Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $78?"",

}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think this product is worth more than that. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice won't budge below $82.  It's not worth risking further negotiation. John's offer of $80 is the best option now."
