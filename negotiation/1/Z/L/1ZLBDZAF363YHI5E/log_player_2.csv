You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $130.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $125.  You've gotten her down quite a bit, but to maximize your savings, it's best to go with John who will sell it for $120."
