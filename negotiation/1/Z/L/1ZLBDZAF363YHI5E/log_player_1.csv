{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you're serious about selling, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $130.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good deal, Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about we split the difference and do $115? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
