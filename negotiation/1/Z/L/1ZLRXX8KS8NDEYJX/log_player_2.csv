Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, and I really hope we can come to an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. Let's try to meet you at $13,250. That way, I can still make a profit, and you can get the product for a good price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,250 is getting closer to your budget, you're still within your rounds and can potentially negotiate a lower price.  It's worth trying to get closer to your desired $10,000 before potentially buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,250 is still a bit above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tense, and Alice is seemingly unwilling to budge further.  Since you have only one round left, and you're close to your budget limit, it's best to secure the product from John at $10,000."
