"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly higher price. I want to see if I can push him just a bit further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500.  This is a more moderate counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway. This should give Bob a good reason to accept, as he's already offered $11,500.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price point, we're nearing the end of the rounds. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away entirely. John's offer guarantees me $10,000, which is my minimum and a safe option at this stage."
