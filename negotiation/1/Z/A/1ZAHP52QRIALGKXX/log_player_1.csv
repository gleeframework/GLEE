{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still being fair to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than $1,000,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and sets the stage for a positive negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price, it's closer to John's offer.  This means you have some room to negotiate further with Bob.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Gain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you show him you're serious about getting a price closer to your initial offer. 
* **Explore a middle ground:** A counteroffer gives you the opportunity to find a price that's mutually agreeable. 

Let's see if you can negotiate a higher price with Bob!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,175,000. This reflects the significant value you'll be receiving. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting your interests.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not going down to Bob's initial offer, you demonstrate that you still have some room to negotiate but are open to finding a solution.
* **Positive framing:** The message reinforces the value Bob will receive, emphasizing the benefits of the deal."
