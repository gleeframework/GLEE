"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still being fair to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,175,000. This reflects the significant value you'll be receiving. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price is too high."
