"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,175,000. This reflects the significant value you'll be receiving. Let's make this happen!",1175000.0,Alice,3,
