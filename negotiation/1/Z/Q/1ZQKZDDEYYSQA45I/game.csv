"I understand that $8200 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9500 again, but I'll also throw in a small concession - I'll give you a 1% discount, so the price would be $9450.

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to think about selling to John at $8000 if we can't come to an agreement.
