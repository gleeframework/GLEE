"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our customers. It comes with exceptional features and benefits that I believe you would appreciate.

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I've done some research and found similar products in the market for this price range. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, due to the costs and expenses involved in providing such a high-quality product, I can't agree to $60. I propose we meet halfway between my initial offer of $85 and your counteroffer of $60, which would result in a price of $72.50. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",72.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $72.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'd like to propose $67. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",67.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to finding a suitable price for our product. Considering our costs and the value provided, I'm willing to offer the product at $70. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it strikes a good balance between our interests. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",70.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $70 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $67 and $70, which would be $68.50. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",68.5,Bob,6,
