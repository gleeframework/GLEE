Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product at a special price of $145. I think it would be perfect for you, but if you're not interested, no worries!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it at $145 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down a little. 
* **Don't Lowball:** Offering it at $100 (Bob's value) is unlikely to be accepted, and it leaves no room for Alice to profit. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but makes it clear that Alice has other options if Bob declines."
