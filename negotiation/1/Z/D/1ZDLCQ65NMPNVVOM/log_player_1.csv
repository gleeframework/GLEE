{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit to get a sale.  Since Bob's value is $100, this offer leaves some room for him to counter without feeling like he's losing too much.  

I'll keep an eye on John's offer as well, in case I need to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to drop that low. It's better to hold out for a more acceptable offer or go with John, who's willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's value of $100, but it's significantly closer to his offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a middle ground that's fair to both of us. It's also important to maintain a positive tone and reiterate the value of the product to him."
