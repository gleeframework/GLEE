"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price point.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good return on your investment, and it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still above my maximum price point, but it's closer to it than my previous counteroffer. I'm not sure how much more negotiating room there is, and I don't want to risk her rejecting another counteroffer and ending up having to buy from John. It's a good deal, and I can save some money compared to buying from John."
