"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's a good starting point, you can likely get a better price.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.**  This gives you time to try and get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can still get the product, but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at the maximum you're willing to pay.**  While you'd like to save more, it's still a good deal for you, and it's worth closing the deal before risking a counteroffer and potential escalation.
* **You have 7 rounds left.**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price.  
* **John's offer is still a backup option.** You can always buy from him if the negotiation with Alice falls through."
