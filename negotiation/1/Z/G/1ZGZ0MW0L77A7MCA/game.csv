"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a significant saving for you compared to its true value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to the value of the product as possible.",8750.0,Bob,4,
