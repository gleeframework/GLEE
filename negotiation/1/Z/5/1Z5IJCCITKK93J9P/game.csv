"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
