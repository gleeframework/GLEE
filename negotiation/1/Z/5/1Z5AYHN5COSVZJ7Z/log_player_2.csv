You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is increasing her price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You're still getting a better deal than buying from John, and there's room for Alice to come down a little more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to pay John's higher price."
