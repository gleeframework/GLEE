"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer, I'm still at my limit of $1050000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
