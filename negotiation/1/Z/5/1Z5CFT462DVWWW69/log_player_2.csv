"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product at a price that's significantly below its true worth. While I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for a higher price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and a fair deal for both of us.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a highly competitive price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
