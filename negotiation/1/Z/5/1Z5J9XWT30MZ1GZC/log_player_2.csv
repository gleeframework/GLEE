"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make you a serious offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price.  $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge closer to Bob's target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll also include a 2-year warranty on the product. This is a rare opportunity to get a top-notch product with excellent support. What do you think?

While the warranty is tempting, Alice is not budging on price, and Bob is getting close to his maximum budget.  It's better to secure the product from John for a guaranteed $800,000."
