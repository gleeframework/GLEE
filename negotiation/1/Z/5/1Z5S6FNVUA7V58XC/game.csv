"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
