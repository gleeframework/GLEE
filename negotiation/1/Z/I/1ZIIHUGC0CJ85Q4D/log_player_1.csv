Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $14,000 is above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $14,000 is lower than Bob's $15,000 valuation, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves room to negotiate higher if Bob counters. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a good deal while keeping the negotiation open."
