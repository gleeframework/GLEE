{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows for potential negotiation while also leaving a healthy profit margin for me.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet my price or if he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I still have room for a better price.  I'm going to try and counteroffer with a price closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it still leaves me a comfortable profit.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
