"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

That's a fair price considering I could get the product from someone else for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your initial offer of $10500 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he could get from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000, as that's my minimum price for this product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $11200? This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,200 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Alice has indicated that this is her final counteroffer.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $10,000 and saving $1,200.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get the price down any further."
