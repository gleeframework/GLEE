"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10500? That's a fair price considering I could get the product from someone else for $10000.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your initial offer of $10500 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10750.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000, as that's my minimum price for this product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $11200? This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",11200.0,Alice,5,
