"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue the product. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I have 8 rounds left, so I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this encourages Bob to accept, but also keeps me above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, I'm now at 6 rounds left and need to consider the risk of continuing.  $9,600 is a decent price and above my minimum value, so it's a good deal."
