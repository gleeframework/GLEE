Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,187,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her last offer. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is the safer bet and guarantees you'll stay within your budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of the deal falling through, leaving you with John's offer as the only option anyway."
