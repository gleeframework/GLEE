"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is a bit out of my price range at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this point.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the flexibility. That's closer to what I had in mind, but still a little high for me. How about $1,125,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,187,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this point.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
