Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you further. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her product's actual value.  There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks her backing out entirely. This price is well within your budget and saves you $300,000 compared to John's offer."
