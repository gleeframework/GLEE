"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $10,000 to you. I am confident it will meet your needs and expectations. To make this opportunity more appealing, I am offering you the chance to acquire this product for $9,500. This is a special offer tailored to your interest and could be the perfect fit for your requirements. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer is slightly below your $10,000 maximum, you know you have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or sticking with John."
