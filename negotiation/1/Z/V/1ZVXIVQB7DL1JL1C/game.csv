"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
