Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $8,750 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,875?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and would get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 8
