"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is great, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $11,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down in price. While I value the product, $12,800 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - $12,400.  This feels fair to us both and gets us closer to a deal.",12400.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go quite that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,600. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12600.0,Alice,7,
