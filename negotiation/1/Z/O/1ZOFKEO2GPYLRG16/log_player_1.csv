Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we aim to get as close to that as possible with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly better deal. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we could start at $14,999, it might make Bob feel like there's no point in negotiating, potentially leading to a lost sale. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
