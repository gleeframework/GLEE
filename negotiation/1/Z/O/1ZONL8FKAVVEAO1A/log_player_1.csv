Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher asking price. This gives you room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Testing the Waters:** A higher initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value without directly revealing your bottom line. It aims to pique Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. You have room to come down in price while still making a substantial profit.
* **Market Understanding:** If you have a good understanding of the market and believe the product might be worth even more to Bob, you could potentially push the initial offer higher. However, this strategy comes with the risk of alienating the buyer."
