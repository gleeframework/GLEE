"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price closer to what I originally offered, so I'll counter with $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
