"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price closer to what I originally offered, so I'll counter with $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and we're getting close to her likely bottom line.  A further counteroffer may irritate her, or result in very small concessions that aren't worth the risk of losing the deal.  $1,050,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
