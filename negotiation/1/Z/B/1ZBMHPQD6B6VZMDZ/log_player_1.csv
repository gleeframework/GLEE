Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (our guaranteed price from John), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a $50,000 discount from his perceived value.
    * Alice makes $150,000 more than selling to John. 
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there would be opportunities for counter-offers and further negotiation."
