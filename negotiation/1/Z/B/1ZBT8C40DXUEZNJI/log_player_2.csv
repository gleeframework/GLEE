"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $50, I have room to negotiate. It's always better to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $45, which is a good price considering my maximum budget is $100. Accepting this offer saves me $55 compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or going through more rounds is not worth the potential savings."
