"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price.  It's unlikely Alice would accept a very low counteroffer right away, so we need to be strategic with our counteroffers to close the gap and reach a favorable deal.  We still have plenty of rounds and the option to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $8,200? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. While $8,200 is closer to a reasonable price, we are aiming for a price much closer to $7,000. Let's see if we can encourage her to move closer to our desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. That's closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $7,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal at $8,100, which is still a great value for this product. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to hold firm around the $8,000 mark.  We're getting close to the point where we might have to concede a bit, but let's try one more time to see if we can get her to come down slightly more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. This is a great product, but I need to stick to my budget. How about we split the difference and call it $7,800?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
``` 

We're getting into the later rounds, so offering to split the difference might be enticing to Alice. It shows we're willing to compromise but also holds a firm line on the budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal at $8,050, which is still a great value for this product. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than this.  It's a reasonable compromise, and we're running out of rounds to negotiate a significantly better price. Accepting this offer allows us to acquire the product below John's price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
