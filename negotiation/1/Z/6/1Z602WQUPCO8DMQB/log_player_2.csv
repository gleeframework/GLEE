"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $10,500. How about meeting halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still try to get a better deal.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to push for a lower price. He can also use the threat of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would save me a considerable amount."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still confident this product is worth more to you in the long run.  Let's try $10,900 â€“ it's a strong offer reflecting the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:**  Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $10,750. 
* **Potential savings:** Buying from Alice at $10,900 is still a significant saving compared to John's price of $12,000.
* **Limited rounds:** There are only 5 rounds left. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of not reaching a deal and being forced to buy from John.

**Decision:** Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice, balancing savings with the risk of not reaching an agreement."
