"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price.  $5,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$4,500 is a good price, and you've already saved $500 from Alice's initial offer. It's not worth risking further negotiation with only 7 rounds left, as you could end up with a worse deal."
