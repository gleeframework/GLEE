* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, Alice's offer of $1,400,000 saves you $100,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $1,500,000, and you're getting it for $1,400,000. That means you're getting a $100,000 discount."
