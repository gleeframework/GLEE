"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $18000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $16500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",16500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $17500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $17000. Would you consider that?",17000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'm still not willing to go any lower. I think this price is fair considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle again? Would you consider $17250?",17250.0,Alice,7,
