"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to work with me, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to sell it for, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $13,800 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John:**  Buying from Alice saves Bob $1,200 compared to John.
* **There's no guarantee of a better price:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will refuse to budge, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting, Bob gets a good deal and avoids potential risk."
