Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, she's indicated this is her final offer.  It's unlikely she'll go as low as $12,000, which is the price John is offering.  To ensure I get the product at the best price, it makes sense to buy from John now."
