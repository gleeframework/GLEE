"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly below his perceived value of the product.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting closer, but Bob is still valuing the product considerably lower than his stated $1,000,000 valuation. It's worth pushing a bit further to try to capture more of that difference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $900,000. This reflects my desire to make this deal work while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $880,000 secures a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price."
