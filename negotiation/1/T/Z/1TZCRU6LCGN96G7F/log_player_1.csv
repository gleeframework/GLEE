Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your guaranteed amount.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a unique product.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing a fair deal""  signals to Bob that there's room for negotiation, making him more likely to engage rather than immediately dismissing the offer as too high.

**Goal:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest at a premium price. If he accepts, you achieve a significantly higher profit. If he negotiates, you can gradually lower the price, knowing you have a safety net with John."
