Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's also a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is my minimum, I'd like to try to get more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering with $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $100 offer, and I've already made a compromise.  I'm not willing to go lower, so I'll take John's offer of $100 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
