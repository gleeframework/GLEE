"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it will be just as valuable for your needs. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects the product's unique value. Let's discuss and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's always beneficial to negotiate, especially when there's a clear difference in desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to set a more reasonable counteroffer and potentially save money."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects the significant value of this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice's new offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price."
