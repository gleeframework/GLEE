"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects the significant value of this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering your willingness to negotiate and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
