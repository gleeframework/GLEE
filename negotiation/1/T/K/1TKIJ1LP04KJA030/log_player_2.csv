It's always better to try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows us to try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make $9200 to be comfortable. Would you be willing to pay that price?

We're still over our target price.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

While $9,000 is getting closer to our target, we can likely still squeeze out a bit more. We have several rounds left, so let's try to negotiate further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $9,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,750,  I really want this product, but I need to stick to my budget."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a little concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $8800, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is starting to get firm and we're getting close to our target. It's probably not worth risking going another round.  It's likely she'll hold firm at $8,800, so we might as well take it."
