"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's try $9,800. That's a good compromise, and it shows I'm serious about making this deal work. What do you say?",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,400. I'm getting close to my limit, but I really want to make this deal work. Can you consider this offer?",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting further apart, not closer. I'm willing to go down to $9,600 as a final offer. It's a big compromise on my part, but I really want to make this deal happen. If you're truly serious about buying the product, this is your last chance to accept.",9600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a big compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,600. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Bob,8,
