Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
