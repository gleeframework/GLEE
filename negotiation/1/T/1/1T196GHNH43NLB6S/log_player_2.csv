You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to lower the price, even slightly. Rejecting the offer allows for that negotiation to begin."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to consider a price closer to $80. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
