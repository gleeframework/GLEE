# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring a lot of value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $12,000. I'll reject the offer and see what John has to offer.
