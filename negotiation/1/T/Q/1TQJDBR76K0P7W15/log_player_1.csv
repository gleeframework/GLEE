Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this value, and I know you'll be happy with it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Testing the Waters:** The $10,000 offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's room to negotiate down towards $8,000, ensuring you don't lose out on the sale."
