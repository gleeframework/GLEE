Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now lower than John's price, and Bob is still saving money compared to his initial goal of $1,200,000. It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer to secure the product at a lower price."
