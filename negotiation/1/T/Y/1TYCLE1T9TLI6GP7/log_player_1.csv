Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable price but lower than the product's value to Bob. This provides room for negotiation without immediately risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I will attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $1,050,000. This counteroffer should keep the negotiation moving forward while still getting closer to my desired price."
