"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $15,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. ",16000.0,Bob,4,
