"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true worth of what it can do for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above his maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $15,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $17,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate, as there are still rounds left and Bob could potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. "", ""product_price"": 16000}
