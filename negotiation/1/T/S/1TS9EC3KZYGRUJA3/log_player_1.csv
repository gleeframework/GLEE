Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,725,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,850,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is reasonably close to my previous counteroffer.  Continuing to push for a higher price might irritate Bob and risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting $1,750,000 is a significant profit, even if it's slightly below my initial target."
