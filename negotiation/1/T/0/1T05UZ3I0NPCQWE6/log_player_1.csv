Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's offer creates an incentive for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want to be close to my minimum, starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, and I can always come down a bit.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  A price significantly higher than $80 (Bob's value) might deter him completely.  This price suggests I'm willing to make a deal."
