"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is well above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not going for the full $15,000 right away because I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm highlighting the deal being beneficial for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds. If he counteroffers, I'll need to assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation with him or if it's better to go with John's guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $11,000 is better than John's $10,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise and still leaves room for you to get a great deal. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $12,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining value:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to maintain a good rapport with Bob and emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to see if he's willing to accept my counteroffer or if he'll continue negotiating. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing profit while still closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential to increase:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly wants the product and is willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above $11,500.  I want to see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $11,800. It's not my ideal price, but I want to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can close this now."", ""product_price"": 11800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $11,800 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by stating that I want to ""make this deal work."" This might incentivize Bob to close the deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still leaving a little room for negotiation, just in case Bob is still hesitant.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him.  If he seems unwilling to budge, I might need to consider selling to John at $10,000 to avoid risking a long negotiation that might not result in a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short. How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation impasse:**  Bob seems to be stuck at $11,500, and further negotiation might be fruitless. 
* **Meeting my minimum:**  While $11,500 isn't ideal, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale, even if it's not at the best price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell him the product for $11,500. I'll then move on to finding new buyers for future products."
