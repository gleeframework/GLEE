"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $1,500,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That's a win-win in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure to accept John's offer, as the rounds are ticking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,400,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise. If we can't agree on this, I may have to consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
