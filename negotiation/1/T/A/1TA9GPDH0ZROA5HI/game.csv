"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $1,500,000 to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That's a win-win in my opinion.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,400,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise. If we can't agree on this, I may have to consider other offers.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
