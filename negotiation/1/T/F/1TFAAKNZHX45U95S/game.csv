"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,
