This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $7,750?

$7,750 is still below my minimum desired price. While it's closer than his previous offer, I'd like to try and get closer to my goal of $10,000. I'll make another counteroffer."
