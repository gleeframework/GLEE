"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price anywhere near $130.  It's time to make a counteroffer much lower to see how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $50 for it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a very low offer ($50) to establish a baseline and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This leaves me plenty of room to increase my offer during the bargaining process. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful to maintain a good negotiating environment but also clearly states my position that the initial price is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $100 is still too high for me. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I want to see if I can get her closer to $80 before considering John's offer. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $70, I'm aiming for a compromise that splits the difference between her latest offer ($100) and my previous one ($50). This shows willingness to negotiate while moving closer to my target.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm getting closer to my walk-away point ($80 from John).  By stating ""a fair price,"" I'm adding a bit of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $90, and while that's tempting, I have a guaranteed option at $80 from John. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice, potentially reaching an impasse, and losing out on both deals. Buying from John ensures I get the product at my target price."
