"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product seems great, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you think $1,100,000 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,250,000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $1,280,000 to try and get this deal done. What do you say?",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,280,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,380,000?",1380000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting frustrating.  My final offer is $1,300,000. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John.",1300000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, which is still a good profit for me. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you say?",1320000.0,Alice,9,
