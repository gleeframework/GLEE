Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice mentions selling elsewhere, she doesn't explicitly use John's offer as leverage. This keeps Bob from thinking she's desperate to sell. 

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly above Alice's minimum while leaving room for a potential counter-offer from Bob."
