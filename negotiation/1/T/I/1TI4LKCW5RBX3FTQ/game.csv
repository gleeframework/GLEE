"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is far below what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still significantly below my minimum. Let's split the difference and go with $110.  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
