"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my current financial constraints, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find common ground. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at a higher price.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your other interested buyer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
