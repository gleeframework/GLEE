(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as $90 is a good price, but you might be able to get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm offering $75, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This should start the negotiation process and show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

$85 is a fair price, and it's better than the $150 offer from John. It's time to close the deal."
