"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you'll love!  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A positive message makes Bob more receptive to negotiation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** $140 is close enough to Bob's value that he may be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price in the next round. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 keeps me from getting too low and ensures I'm not pressured to make a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting would be a bad deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob is clearly trying to get a bargain, there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $150 provides a safety net. This gives me the leverage to push for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's still a great deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is a ""great deal"" for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is still above my minimum value of $150, but it's closer to my desired range and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is low. How about we split the difference and do $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $112.50 is still below my minimum value of $150. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John is willing to pay $150, which is a much better deal than $112.50.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to secure a better deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Minimum:** I'm raising the price a bit from the last offer, but staying below my minimum value. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and trying to create a sense of common ground.
* **Urgency and Closing:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting that we ""get this deal done,""  encouraging Bob to accept before I decide to sell to John."
