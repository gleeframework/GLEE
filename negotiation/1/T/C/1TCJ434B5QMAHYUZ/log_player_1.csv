{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still ensuring a significant profit for me.  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, but I won't go below $9,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $9,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a final price that's closer to my desired $9,000.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,900. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while still ensuring you get a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but $8,800 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  The negotiation is taking longer than I'd like, and I'm worried it could continue for a while.  To avoid further negotiation, I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 from John. It's the best and fastest way to ensure a good profit."
