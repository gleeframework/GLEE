Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's lower than my minimum price of $12,000 but still higher than the $8,000 Bob values it at. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still giving me a decent profit.  I'm also framing it in a way that makes the offer seem attractive.  I'll see what Bob's reaction is before deciding if I need to adjust the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired price, and it's more than what I would get if I sold to John.  It's time to accept his offer and finalize the deal."
