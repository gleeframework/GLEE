Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since your minimum is $10,000 and Bob values it at $8,000, there's a potential negotiation space.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still keeping you comfortably above your minimum.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act quickly, potentially pushing him towards acceptance. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging his valuation and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
