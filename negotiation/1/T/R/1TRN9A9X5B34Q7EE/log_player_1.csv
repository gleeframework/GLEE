Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,150,000 is a significant profit for me, while still being below Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to discussion and willing to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good result!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your desired selling point and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. I can do better. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and find a price we're both comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my desired profit margin.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price slightly from the previous round. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** $1,100,000 is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** This price still allows me to achieve a significant profit while demonstrating flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing the desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**
