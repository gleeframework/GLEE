"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I need to keep my costs down. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,100,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $1,250,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost within my budget. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
