"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's also a significant markup from her estimated value of $1,200,000.  I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now within my budget of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to pay less, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal to John.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product and still save $150,000 compared to buying from John."
