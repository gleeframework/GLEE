"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. Bob can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
