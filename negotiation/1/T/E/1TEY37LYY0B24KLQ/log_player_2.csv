**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has come down considerably in price. At $790,000, the offer is a good compromise â€“  a significant savings compared to John's price while still being reasonably close to Alice's desired value.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
