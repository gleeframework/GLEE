"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Offering $130 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget.
* **Showing Interest:**  The message emphasizes that you are interested in the product, but want a better price. This encourages Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good compromise.  It's still within your budget and closer to your initial counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might save you a few dollars, but it risks the deal falling apart.  At this point, it's likely a better strategy to accept the offer and secure the product."
