"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise and settle on $11,250? It's a fair price that gets us closer to an agreement. I'm eager to get this deal done, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $10,900? It's the best I can do, and I really want to make this deal work.",10900.0,Bob,6,
