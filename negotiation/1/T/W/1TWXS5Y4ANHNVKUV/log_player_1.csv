Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value might increase when offered publicly, justifying the high price. 
* **Direct and polite:** The tone is professional and encourages Bob to engage without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob might negotiate down towards his value of $12,000.  You can then decide whether to accept a lower offer or proceed with John."
