"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can go as high as $137.50. How about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,130.0,Bob,6,
