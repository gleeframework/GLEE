{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. I need to negotiate a lower price.  I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $12,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $11,000 is close, but I need to be firm at $11,750. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my budget of $10,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made two counteroffers and it's getting close to the end of our allotted rounds. I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from John for a better price.  I'll choose to buy from John."
