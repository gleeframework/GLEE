"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $11,000 is close, but I need to be firm at $11,750. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,
