Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $120 is still lower than my minimum price of $150, which allows for potential counteroffers.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message can encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My minimum goal is $150, and Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below that. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, I can still negotiate upwards and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum, so I don't need to accept a price that's too far below that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise between my previous price and Bob's offer.
* **Motivating Counteroffer:**  By offering a lower price, I'm more likely to encourage Bob to make another counteroffer, hopefully closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $110 is still above my minimum price, so I'm not losing out on a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and am willing to meet you halfway at $105. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Bob's offer of $105 is still significantly below my minimum goal of $150.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We've been going back and forth, and I'm not sure how much higher Bob is willing to go.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees my desired profit and avoids further negotiation. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get a fair price for my product without risking a long and potentially unproductive negotiation with Bob."
