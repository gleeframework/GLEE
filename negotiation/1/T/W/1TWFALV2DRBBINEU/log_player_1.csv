"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $140 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and increases the likelihood of Bob engaging in the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and invites Bob to respond, hopefully leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price, but I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **I have 9 rounds left.** There's still time to negotiate a price closer to my target, and I'm confident I can get a better offer. 
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a small reduction:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering the price but not going too low. A $5 drop shows I'm serious about making a deal, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone helps keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Focusing on the deal:** The message emphasizes the possibility of closing the deal, rather than dwelling on the difference in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is not what I was thinking. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $125 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $150. I can afford to hold out for a better offer. 
* **Several rounds left:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample opportunity to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is strong leverage:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $150 gives me a strong bargaining position and encourages Bob to come up with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This counteroffer is presented as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by proposing a price exactly between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Implying alternatives:** By mentioning other options, I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have alternatives if we can't reach an agreement.  This adds pressure to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Time is running out:** We're down to 4 rounds, and I'm running out of time to get a better offer from Bob.
* **John's offer is a safe haven:** I'm confident that I can sell to John for $150. This gives me the safety net to reject Bob's offer.
* **Potential for counteroffer:** I'm hoping that rejecting Bob's offer will encourage him to come closer to my price in his next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $130 for the product. This is truly my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and urgency:** This counteroffer is presented as my ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **No further compromise:** I'm not willing to go lower than $130. This communicates that I'm serious about closing the deal at this price.
* **Emphasis on alternative:**  By mentioning other buyers, I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have options. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message aims to find a ""solution that works for both of us."" This emphasizes a win-win outcome, encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to pay $126 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to our final two rounds, and it's highly unlikely that Bob will come up to my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No significant gain from further negotiation:** I've already made concessions, and Bob hasn't shown a willingness to meet me halfway.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.

I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and it's more prudent to accept his offer and secure a guaranteed profit rather than risk losing out on a better price with Bob."
