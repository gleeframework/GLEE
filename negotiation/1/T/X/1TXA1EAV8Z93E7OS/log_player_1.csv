Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting a ""limited time"" and emphasizing ""value,"" you create a sense of urgency and subtly imply the price is justified.
* **Leaving room:** Offering it at $140 leaves space to potentially drop the price slightly if Bob tries to negotiate, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price."
