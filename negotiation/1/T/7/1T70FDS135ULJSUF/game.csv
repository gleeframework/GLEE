"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",13000.0,Alice,3,
