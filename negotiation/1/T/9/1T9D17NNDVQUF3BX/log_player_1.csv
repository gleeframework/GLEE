"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think will be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $7,000 is too low. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $8,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my minimum,  $7,750 is still too low. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. I'm still not comfortable with $7,750, but I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to match that price?  It would allow me to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is very close to my minimum of $10,000. Accepting his offer ensures a sale, and I can always try to get a better deal with John in the future if the opportunity arises."
