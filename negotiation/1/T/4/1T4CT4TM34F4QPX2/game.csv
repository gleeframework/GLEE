"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $140. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
