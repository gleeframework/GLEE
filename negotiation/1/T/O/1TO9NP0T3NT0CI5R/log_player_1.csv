{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120, but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good strategy to show you are willing to be flexible and open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is your minimum,  Bob's offer is your minimum. There's still room to negotiate a higher price.  You can try to counter with a price slightly higher than $120 to see if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal, and you'll be getting a top-quality product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still hoping to keep the price at or below $120. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $122? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $122 isn't ideal, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $120. This is a good compromise that allows you to earn a bit more, and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher."
