"I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let's find a middle ground, and I believe we can make this deal work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value I see in it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll be moving on to another buyer who is willing to pay full value. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
