{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price that reflects its significant value. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let's find a middle ground, and I believe we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer.  However, I'm getting closer to selling to John if we don't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value I see in it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll be moving on to another buyer who is willing to pay full value. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,025,000 isn't ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and a lot closer to my goal than selling to John.  I'll take the deal."
