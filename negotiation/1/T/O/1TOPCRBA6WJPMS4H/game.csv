"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these prices?",12000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I'm willing to spend on the negotiation.",18000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe that $12000 is a fair price for the product based on my research and understanding of its market value. I would like to stick to my original offer of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,4,,
