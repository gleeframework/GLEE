"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $8,000.**  You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  It's good to have, but you want to see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,500?  That's still a great price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your target price range.** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $8,800. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but it's not worth the risk.**  There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price, and you could end up paying more if you reject her offer and she counters with a higher price.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  There's no reason to pay more when you have a good deal from Alice."
