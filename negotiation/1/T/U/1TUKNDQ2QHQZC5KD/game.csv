"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. Given my budget, I can only offer $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. I'm confident you'll see the value in this product and be willing to meet me halfway.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I hope you can see the value in this compromise and be willing to meet me at this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, which is my final offer. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to accept $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I hope you can see the value in this compromise and be willing to meet me at this price.",880000.0,Alice,7,
