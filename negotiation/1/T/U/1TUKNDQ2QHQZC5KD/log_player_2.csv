"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. Given my budget, I can only offer $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. I'm confident you'll see the value in this product and be willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's price point, $900,000 is still above his budget. He should continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I hope you can see the value in this compromise and be willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to secure a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, which is my final offer. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to accept $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I hope you can see the value in this compromise and be willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $880,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  With only three rounds left, there's a high chance that the negotiations will continue to drag on without reaching a satisfying price for Bob. Given that John is offering the product for $800,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the deal with John rather than risk further negotiations with Alice and potentially running out of rounds."
