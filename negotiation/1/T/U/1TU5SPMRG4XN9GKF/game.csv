"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925000?  This gives you a good price and allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm ready to be flexible. I'm willing to drop my price to $900000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to move closer to my desired outcome. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000. This price allows us both to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
