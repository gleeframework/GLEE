{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's perceived value of $1,200,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and you have multiple rounds to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  We're offering $850,000, which is a significant step down from Alice's offer and is close to our maximum budget. This shows a genuine attempt at negotiation while staying within our financial constraints.

* **Negotiation Space:**  By offering $850,000, we've created some room for compromise in future rounds, allowing for potential adjustments based on Alice's response."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925000?  This gives you a good price and allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, $925,000 is still beyond my maximum budget of $800,000.  
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** There's still space for negotiation. We can continue to try and lower the price, especially with 7 rounds left. 
* **Jhon's Offer:** Remember, we have a guaranteed alternative of buying the product from Jhon for $800,000.  This provides a strong negotiating position, allowing us to be more firm in rejecting offers that don't meet our needs."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm ready to be flexible. I'm willing to drop my price to $900000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to move closer to my desired outcome. Let's make this happen.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000.
