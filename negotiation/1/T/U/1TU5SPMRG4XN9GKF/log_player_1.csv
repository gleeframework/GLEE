"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to gauge Bob's interest and hopefully move closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This gives you a good price and allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer, but I'm also concerned about running out of rounds. I'll counter with a lower price again, but this time I'll be more willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm ready to be flexible. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to move closer to my desired outcome. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000. This price allows us both to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
