Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get. Can you meet me at that price or lower?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is still a good price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I can't go lower than $9,800. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. If you're truly interested, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one.  While I'd love to get closer to $10,000, I'm starting to run out of time and rounds.  Selling to Bob for $9,200 is a better deal than selling to John for $8,000, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
