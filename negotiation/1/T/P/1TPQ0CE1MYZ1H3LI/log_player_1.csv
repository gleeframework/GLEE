"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction carefully to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not ready to accept it. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell.  I want to find a middle ground that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still keeping it above $1,000,000.  With only five rounds left, I need to start closing the gap and getting closer to a deal.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to accept it.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I'm not satisfied with the deal, but it's always good to try and get the best possible price."
