"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. While I'm confident in its worth, I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm asking for $1,200,000, which is significantly less than its value to you. This offer is valid for a limited time, as I have other interested parties. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has indicated she has other potential buyers.  While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity to counter-offer and potentially secure a price closer to Alice's $800,000 valuation."
