"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. While I'm confident in its worth, I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm asking for $1,200,000, which is significantly less than its value to you. This offer is valid for a limited time, as I have other interested parties. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
