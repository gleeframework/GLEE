"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $15,000. We're confident this investment will pay off greatly for you. Let's discuss how we can make this work for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. Given the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate closer to your offer. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from our initial asking price, but I hope it allows us to move forward with the transaction. Please let me know if this is acceptable, or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm firm on $12,000. If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to look at other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. To further explore the possibility of a successful transaction, I am willing to consider a price of $13,500 for the product. This represents a substantial discount from our initial asking price, while still allowing us to cover our costs and ensure a reasonable profit. I hope this revised offer will be more in line with what you are looking for. Let me know your thoughts, and we can continue our discussion.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. $13,500 is getting closer. However, I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I'm glad to hear that we're closing in on a mutually beneficial arrangement. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to accept $13,250 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions and allows us to achieve a satisfactory outcome for both parties involved. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and facilitates the completion of this transaction.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still hoping to keep the price a bit lower.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,8,
