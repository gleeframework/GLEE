Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $115, which is still a good deal for you, and it's getting close to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is not going to budge on the price and it's better to secure the product at the known price of $100 from John than to continue negotiating with Alice and risk paying even more."
