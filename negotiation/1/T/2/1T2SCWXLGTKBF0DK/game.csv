"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can do $105, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a good compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $100 is my absolute limit. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $115, which is still a good deal for you, and it's getting close to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",115.0,Alice,7,
