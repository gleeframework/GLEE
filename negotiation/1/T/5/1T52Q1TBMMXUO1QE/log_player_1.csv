"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  I believe it would be of great benefit to you. I'm asking for $1,150,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price closer to his maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I don't want to start too high and scare Bob off, especially in the first round. A slightly lower initial offer shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me at least $1,000,000. This knowledge gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but I have to be honest, that price is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $1,100,000. This product is a real game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see a fantastic return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Firmness:** I'm reducing my price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm also making it clear that Bob's initial offer was far too low. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, aiming to shift his focus away from just the ""market value"" (which might be an inaccurate assessment in this scenario).
* **Strategic Movement:**  While I'm dropping my price, it's still above my safety net ($1,000,000 from John), allowing me to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met me very close to the middle ground between our previous offers. While I could potentially push for a bit more, accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate."
