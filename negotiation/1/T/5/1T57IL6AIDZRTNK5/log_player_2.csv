"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and offer significant returns on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us.  How about we bring the price down significantly to  $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor low:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (almost a third of Alice's initial price) can help shift the negotiation in your favor. This establishes a lower point for further discussion.
* **Polite but firm:** The message is respectful while clearly stating that Alice's initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering $600,000 leaves space for counteroffers while staying well below your maximum budget and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but your offer is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more reasonable offer from your side. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is her exact valuation and still exceeds your maximum price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While her counteroffer is a significant move from her initial offer, it suggests she's willing to negotiate. There's still space to work towards a more agreeable price.
* **John's offer as leverage:** You have the security of John's $800,000 offer, which gives you leverage to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that this product holds a high value for you, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find a compromise. How about $750,000?  That reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** This offer shows movement from your previous $600,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  The $750,000 offer is closer to your $800,000 walk-away point (John's offer) but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise and acknowledges the value of Alice's product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous price, bringing it to $975,000? This demonstrates my flexibility while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $975,000 is still significantly above your $800,000 maximum and John's standing offer.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Alice is consistently lowering her price, indicating she's open to further negotiation. 
* **Time for a stronger counter:** You've been gradually increasing your offer; now it's time to hold your ground more firmly to guide the price closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $975,000 is still pushing my budget. To be transparent, I do have another option at $800,000. I believe this product is worth going a little higher for, so I'm willing to offer you $850,000.  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal alternative:** By mentioning your $800,000 alternative, you introduce a sense of urgency and provide a concrete reason for your price ceiling. 
* **Firm but fair:** Stating ""$850,000 is a firm offer"" sets a clear boundary while still demonstrating some flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to fairness:** Emphasizing fairness and compromise can encourage Alice to accept a price closer to your target. 
* **Time constraint:**  You are getting closer to your walk-away point. Introducing this element might encourage Alice to agree to this round."
