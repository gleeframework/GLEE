"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth at least $1000000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000 on this product.  I understand it's worth more to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to maximize my earnings. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
