{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,500 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it lower.  There's no reason to rush into a deal in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price much closer to his maximum budget. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate seriously."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room to negotiate. Bob should continue trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice he's willing to move but still wants a better deal.  This is a more realistic counteroffer, and if Alice rejects, it might be time to consider John's offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but there's still room to negotiate.  Bob should continue trying to get a better deal before considering John's offer. It's worth exploring if there's further room for Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

Bob is offering the same price Alice offered in the first round. This is a strong signal that he's willing to meet in the middle but won't go any higher. Alice has to decide if she wants to accept this offer or risk losing the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject this offer. While it's getting closer to his ideal price, he's already countered with $10,500, a price Alice previously accepted. He's shown he's willing to meet in the middle and can likely get a better offer than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly again, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but still wants a better deal than $11,500. This is a compromise between his last offer and Alice's last offer. This could be his final offer before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has rejected his counteroffer and it's clear she's not going to come down to his price. There's only one round left, and buying from John will save Bob time and effort. While it's not the ideal price, it's within his budget and a better option than continuing to negotiate."
