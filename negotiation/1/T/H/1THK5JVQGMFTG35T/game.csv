"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation, but I'm not willing to go too low. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $9,750. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
