"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your starting price. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $975,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more acceptable price. While we have a guaranteed sale with John, there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob before settling for the backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with one of the buyers soon."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another buyer introduces a sense of urgency without completely revealing the guaranteed offer. 
* **""Final Offer"":**  This signals to Bob that this is a serious point in the negotiation, and further haggling might lead to losing the deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $1,000,000 is a strong psychological anchor and represents a significant compromise from both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000, and I think $975,000 is a fair price. I'm not budging from this price, so I'll stick with my previous offer. Can you meet me at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $975,000 offer.  
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees a solid profit with no further risk or time investment. 

It's time to cut our losses and move forward with the guaranteed sale to John."
