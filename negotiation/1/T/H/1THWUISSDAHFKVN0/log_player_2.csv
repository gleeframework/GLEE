"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly below its worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other buyers lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $10,000.** This is below your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $2,000** compared to buying from John.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save money."
