"Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for such a valuable product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, how about $14,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $15,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
