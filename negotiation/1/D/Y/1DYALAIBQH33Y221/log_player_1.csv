"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  It's important to leave room for a few counteroffers, but I want to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110,  let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground by reducing my offer to $110, aiming for a price that's still profitable for me while potentially being more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still believe $100 is a fair price. Would you be willing to meet us halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have more rounds available and believe I can potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This way we can both be happy and close the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5} 
```

I'm continuing to negotiate by offering a compromise price of $107.50, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I am willing to pay $106 for the product. Is this within your acceptable range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $106 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range.  I'm going to continue negotiating, as I have more rounds available and believe I can still reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $106.50. This is a fair price for both of us, let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 106.5} 
``` 
I'm offering a price of $106.50, which is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my original asking price.  This shows my willingness to compromise, but I'm hoping to secure a deal that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
