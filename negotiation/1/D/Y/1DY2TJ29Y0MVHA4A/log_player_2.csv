{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

 You're looking to save money, and $125 is still more than you're willing to pay. Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

$120 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay, but Alice seems willing to negotiate. Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can do $118, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $118, which is within your budget and a good deal for you. You're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, so accepting this offer is the best option."
