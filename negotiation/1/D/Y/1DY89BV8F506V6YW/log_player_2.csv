Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his budget. He can get a better deal by either negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, it's still above his budget of $8,000. He can still get the product from John for less."

Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $10,200 is still above his budget and he's already made two counteroffers. At this point, it's unlikely Alice will accept a lower price, and Bob is better off buying from John for a guaranteed price within his budget."
