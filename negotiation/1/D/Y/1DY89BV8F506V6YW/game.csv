"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
