"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $15000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I must respectfully decline. I am unable to go above $15000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can meet you halfway between $17000 and $14000, so how about $16500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I am unable to move beyond $15000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $15000?",15000.0,Bob,6,

"I've thought about it, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $15000, but I need to be honest with you, I've already had another interested buyer who is willing to pay the full $15000, so I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. If you're serious about the product, I'd be willing to sell it to you now at this price.",15000.0,Alice,7,
