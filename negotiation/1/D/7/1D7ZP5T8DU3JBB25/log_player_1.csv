"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to secure a deal closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a solution.  However, $10,250 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $10,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to be satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10750. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $10500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is now within a range that's acceptable to me. It's getting closer to my desired price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing this deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of a potential deadlock or the need to sell to John for a lower profit."
