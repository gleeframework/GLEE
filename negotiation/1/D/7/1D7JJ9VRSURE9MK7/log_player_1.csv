Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I've started high, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, allowing for some negotiation. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly means I don't have to wait for John, even if John guarantees my minimum price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
