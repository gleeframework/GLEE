"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum.  It's a bit risky, but if he's really interested, he might come close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $140 is close to my minimum, but I think I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum and I hope he'll bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum,  it's getting late in the game.  $145 is a decent price and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn."
