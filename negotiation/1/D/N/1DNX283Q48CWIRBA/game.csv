"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000 if we can reach an agreement.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
