Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000 if we can reach an agreement.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting the offer. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
