{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offer is getting further away from my desired price. While I'm still not satisfied with his latest offer, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might result in further lowering the price, potentially falling below my minimum of $800,000. To avoid this risk, it's best to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John and close the deal."
