"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know you'd get a lot of use out of it. I'm offering it to you for $125, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price ($125) is lower than John's price ($150).** This means accepting Alice's offer will save you $25.
* **Your maximum willingness to pay is $150.** Since Alice's offer is within that range, it makes financial sense to accept."
