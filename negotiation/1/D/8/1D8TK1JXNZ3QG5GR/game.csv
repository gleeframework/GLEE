"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,280,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into this negotiation. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,3,
