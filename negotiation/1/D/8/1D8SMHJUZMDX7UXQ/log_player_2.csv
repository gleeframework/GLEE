This is a very high offer from Alice. As a shrewd buyer, Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still too high for Bob's budget. He should try to negotiate further to get a price closer to his own valuation."
