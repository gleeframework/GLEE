Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,500,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. This price reflects my budget and my assessment of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge much from his $1,100,000 offer.  Rather than continue to haggle and potentially lose a sure sale, it's more profitable to sell to John at the guaranteed $1,200,000 price."
