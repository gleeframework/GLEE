"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the significant potential this product holds.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,500,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. This price reflects my budget and my assessment of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
