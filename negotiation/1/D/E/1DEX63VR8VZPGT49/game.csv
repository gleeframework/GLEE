"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $825,000? That's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,6,
