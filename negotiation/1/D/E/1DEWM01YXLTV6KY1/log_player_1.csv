"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I'm also hoping he'll be impressed by the initial value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in completely. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still staying above Bob's last offer. I believe this shows good faith and might encourage him to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a significant improvement over his previous offers, and it's getting closer to my desired value.  We're both showing flexibility, and I believe this is a good deal for both of us."
