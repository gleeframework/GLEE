"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can still push for a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired range within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $980,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves a good margin for profit. I'm hoping to reach an agreement within the next few rounds and avoid selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I initially aimed for a higher price,  we're now in round 4, and the risk of continuing negotiations is increasing.  There's a good chance Bob might not come back with a higher offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $965,000 is a good price and secures a profitable sale."
