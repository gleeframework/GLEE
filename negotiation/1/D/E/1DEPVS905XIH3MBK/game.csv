"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like your persistence! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further to close this deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not at $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, which is $13,500, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,750. Let me know if that works for you.",13750.0,Alice,7,
