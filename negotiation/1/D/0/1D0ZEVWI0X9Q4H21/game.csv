"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.",16500.0,Bob,4,
