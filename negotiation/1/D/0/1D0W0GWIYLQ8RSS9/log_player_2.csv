"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price from Alice, especially since the product is worth $80 to her.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $112.50. This is a good compromise, and you're still getting the product for a price significantly lower than John's $150. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a much lower price from Alice without risking losing the deal entirely."
