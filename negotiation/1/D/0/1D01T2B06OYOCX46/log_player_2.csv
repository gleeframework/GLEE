Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $7,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm on a tight budget. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $6,750. That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 6750}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,750 still falls short of my expectation. How about we split the difference once more and go with $6,875? This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,875. 
You have three options:
