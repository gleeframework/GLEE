"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $7,500 is still a bit steep for me. I could do $6,500.  Would that work for you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $7,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm on a tight budget. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $6,750. That's the best I can do.",6750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,750 still falls short of my expectation. How about we split the difference once more and go with $6,875? This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",6875.0,Alice,7,
