"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product that's worth at least $1000000 to you.  I know its value to you, and I'm confident this product will be a significant asset.  I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1050000. This is a fair offer, considering the product's potential. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer is for $1,050,000, which is more than your maximum budget. Therefore, you should reject her offer. You can still get the product from John for your maximum price."
