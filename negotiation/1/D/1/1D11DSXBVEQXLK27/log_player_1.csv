{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I'm maximizing my potential profit, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counter and work towards a mutually beneficial price.  I'm also aware of John's offer, which serves as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I initially proposed. While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price. My goal is to maximize my profit, and I'm confident I can still do better than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is getting closer to what I'm aiming for. While it's still slightly below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations and secure the sale.  It's important to remember that John is still an option, but Bob's offer is a better deal for me at this point."
