Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $170 allows room for Bob to negotiate down.  Even if he manages to haggle the price down a bit, you'll still likely get more than $150. 
* **Gauge Interest:** A higher initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can move on to John."
