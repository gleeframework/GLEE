Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below his perceived value leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net.  This allows for a more ambitious initial offer to Bob."
