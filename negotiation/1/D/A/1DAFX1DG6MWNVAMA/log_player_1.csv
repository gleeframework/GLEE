Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $80 to me. While $75 is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $78 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $80 if these negotiations fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about $80? This is my minimum price, but I'm willing to close the deal at that price to avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 80}
