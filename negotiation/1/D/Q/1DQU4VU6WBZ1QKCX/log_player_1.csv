"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that might seem reasonable to Bob, considering he values the product at $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $175, there's room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm trying to maintain a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Although Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still potential to find a compromise within the remaining rounds.
* **Sell to John is too risky:**  While John offers $150, there's no guarantee I can get that price from him in subsequent rounds if I reject Bob's counteroffer. It's better to explore negotiation with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. That still leaves some room for me to make a profit, and hopefully, it's a price you're comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $125 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive and reasonable tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone while being firm in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $100 is exactly halfway between my last offer of $125 and his previous offer of $80. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise.
* **Acceptable Price:** While $100 is lower than I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I run the risk that John's price might not be as high as I anticipate, or he might not be interested in buying anymore. It's safer to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
