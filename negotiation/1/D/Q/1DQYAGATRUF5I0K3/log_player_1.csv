"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he can potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm raising the price a bit from Bob's offer, but still offering a price lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while remaining within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a deal that's closer to my minimum value. I have 6 more rounds, so I'm not under pressure to close the deal immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm sticking with my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and hopefully Bob will finally agree."
