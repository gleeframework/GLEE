"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about $95? That's a good compromise and still leaves us both with a fair deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.,85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price that benefits us both.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $90 is the best price for the product. Would you be willing to go down to $87? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer.,87.0,Bob,6,
