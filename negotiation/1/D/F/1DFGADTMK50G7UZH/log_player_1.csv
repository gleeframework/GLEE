"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still potentially appealing to Bob.  I'm aiming to leave some room for negotiation, but also want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I'm hoping it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $128 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get significantly more with more rounds of negotiation. There's a risk that Bob will walk away, or that I'll have to accept a lower price later on. I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
