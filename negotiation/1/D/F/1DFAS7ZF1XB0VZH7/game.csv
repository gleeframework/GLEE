"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  While $900,000 is better, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we possibly settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm not sure if you'll be able to get a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,5,
