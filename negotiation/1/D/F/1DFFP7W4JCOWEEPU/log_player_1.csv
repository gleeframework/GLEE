"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This will give me room to negotiate down while still making a good profit.  I also want to start by establishing my value proposition and framing the negotiation as a fair exchange."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me at this point. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1 million.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a counter-offer that is still above my minimum, but significantly lower than the initial price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desired profit margin. I'm also reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to persuade him to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not there.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for me while also giving you a fair return. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to risk losing out on the potential of getting my full asking price of $1,000,000 from John.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding firm at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value the product provides you.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm increasing my pressure on Bob by making this my ""final offer"". This puts the onus on him to either accept or risk losing the product.  The offer is at my minimum acceptable price, so I'm prepared to walk away if Bob continues to refuse."
