"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you at a special price of $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10200 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another slight concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
