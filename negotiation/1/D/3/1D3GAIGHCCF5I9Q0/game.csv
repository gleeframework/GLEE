,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $200? I think you'll really love this product, and I'm willing to give you a good deal.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $200 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175?",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $175, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $190? I'm confident that this product will be worth it to you in the long run.",190.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit tired of going back and forth, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can do $185, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it!",185.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're tired of negotiating, but I'm still not comfortable with $185. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $185, which would be $182.50. Can you consider that?",182.5,Bob,8,
