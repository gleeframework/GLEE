Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to acquire this product at a more competitive price point. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1200000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $1250000?

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
