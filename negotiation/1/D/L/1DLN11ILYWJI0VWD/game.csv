"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and understanding of the market, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering its potential value and my own financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive market research and am confident in its potential to generate much higher returns. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value and the potential for profit it holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be a fair compromise, reflecting both the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. However, the $1,000,000 offer still doesn't reflect the true market value of this product and the potential returns it offers.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still far above my budget. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, and I believe a price of $1,200,000 is a fair compromise. This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you receive a reasonable amount for its value.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this negotiation. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $1,500,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for my product, and I value our discussions.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
