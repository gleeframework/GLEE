Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering my budget limitations. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is appealing, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2000000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, and I truly believe that's a fair price for both of us. If we can't come to an agreement, I'm going to have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, we are still significantly above his perceived value of the product.  There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a price closer to $1,500,000, especially since he seems motivated to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. I'm prepared to make my final offer – $1,550,000. This reflects the product's genuine value while acknowledging your investment. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer is strategic:

* **Close to Bob's Limit:** We've been slowly drawing Bob up in price, and this offer is likely nearing his maximum.
* **Above Our Minimum:**  While close to our backup offer, the extra $50,000 is still worthwhile if Bob accepts.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting it as a final offer, we add a touch of pressure to encourage a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is only $100,000 less than our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further risks Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting now secures a significant profit.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner allows us to deploy the capital elsewhere more quickly."
