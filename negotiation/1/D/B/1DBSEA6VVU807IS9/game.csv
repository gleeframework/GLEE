"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth a lot to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $130. We believe this is a fair price given its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $122.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $118.75?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",118.75,Bob,4,
