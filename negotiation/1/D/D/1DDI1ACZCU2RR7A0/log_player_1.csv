{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above Bob's valuation but below your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. It looks like a great product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
