"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that works for you!

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, I can still try to negotiate a slightly better deal. Accepting $10,200 would mean overpaying compared to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,600? That's a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that's acceptable to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's price went up instead of down. It's clear she's not willing to budge closer to my budget, and I'm not going to get a better deal than John's offer of $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
