{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he wants to counteroffer. It's important to maintain a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit though, how about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still higher than my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for a loss. The message is friendly and tries to highlight the benefit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to sell for that price. I think I can get closer to $120 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  How about $110?  That's a good compromise, and it's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting as close to $120 as possible.  Offering $110 shows I'm flexible but not willing to go much lower. The message is encouraging and emphasizes the benefits of a deal for both of us."
