"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Would you be willing to go up to $90?  This is a great deal for a truly valuable product.",90.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $87.50?,87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $87.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? This is a fair price that benefits us both.",88.5,Alice,5,
