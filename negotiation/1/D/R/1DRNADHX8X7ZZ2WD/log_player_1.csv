"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Openness:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable entering a discussion. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's uniqueness, hoping to spark Bob's interest. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's initial interest while leaving room for negotiation.  If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, it's worth exploring if I can get more. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's initial rejection and counteroffer show he's interested but wants a lower price.  There's room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but there's a chance I could get more from Bob.  

I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17,500 to seal the deal.  This product is truly unique and offers you significant value.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than his initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's uniqueness and value to reinforce its worth.
* **Framing:** I'm framing this as a ""middle ground"" to encourage a positive response and move towards a deal. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that's both attractive to Bob and profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $16500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $500 less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for More Rounds:** While I could counteroffer again, it's likely that the negotiations will go back and forth with very small increments.
* **Time Factor:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to consider the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and losing time to get to John. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice.  I secure a price close to my minimum while avoiding the risk of a prolonged negotiation with a potentially uncertain outcome."
