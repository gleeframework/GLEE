Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value. This is a fair starting point for us to work from. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would help us move forward with the sale.
