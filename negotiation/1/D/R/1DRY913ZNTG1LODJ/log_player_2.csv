"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to you. You have a lot of room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value. This is a fair starting point for us to work from. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to your desired price, you can still get a better deal. You're willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would help us move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go up to $975,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer $980,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is very close to your desired price of $1,000,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she'll reject your counteroffer and the price might not go up further.  Additionally, you're getting a significant discount compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a good price without further risk or delay."
