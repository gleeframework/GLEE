"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value. This is a fair starting point for us to work from. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would help us move forward with the sale.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go up to $975,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer $980,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,
