# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be very beneficial to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,350,000 is my final offer.  This price still leaves room for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise.  While it's higher than Bob's counteroffer, it's still lower than John's price of $1,500,000. It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him $150,000 compared to John's price."
