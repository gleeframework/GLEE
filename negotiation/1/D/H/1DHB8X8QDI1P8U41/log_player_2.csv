"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is just a little too low for me. How about $135? That's still a great price for this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his target.  Since Bob has 10 rounds to make a deal and wants to save as much as possible, accepting this offer is the best strategy. It's better to get a good deal now than risk going back and forth with Alice and potentially ending up paying more, or having to buy from John for $150."
