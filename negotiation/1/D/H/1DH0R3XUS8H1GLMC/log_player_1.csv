Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob refuses.

Therefore, offering the product slightly below John's buying price ($119) maximizes the potential profit. Bob gets the product for less than his perceived value, and Alice makes a better profit than selling directly to John."
