Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and increases the potential profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept an offer below her minimum. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with $12,000, Alice sets a high anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if she started closer to $8,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price. However, with the knowledge that John is waiting in the wings, Alice has a strong position to negotiate from."
