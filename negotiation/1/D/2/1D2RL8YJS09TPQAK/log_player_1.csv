{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a million, we're still in the early stages of negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  We'll hold firm for now and see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I want to be completely transparent with you. I have another buyer interested who's offering $1,000,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is my absolute final offer. Take it or leave it."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to lay all the cards on the table. By revealing John's offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob now knows there's a real risk of losing the deal. By setting a firm ""take it or leave it"" stance at $1,200,000, we aim to maximize our potential profit while also giving Bob a chance to secure the product."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. If this is not acceptable, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is bluffing. He's trying to use John's offer against you, even though it's clear that he would not purchase the product for $1,500,000 when his previous offers have been much lower. By sticking to your guns and selling to John for your baseline of $1,000,000 you ensure you receive a fair deal and don't get caught up in Bob's last-minute negotiation tactics."
