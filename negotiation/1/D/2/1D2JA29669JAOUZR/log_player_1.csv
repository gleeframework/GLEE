Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying you have other interested buyers like John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity.

**Important:** While John acts as a safety net, aiming higher with Bob first is strategically sound."
