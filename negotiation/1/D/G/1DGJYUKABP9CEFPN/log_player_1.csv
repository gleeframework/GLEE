Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, recognizing its worth to you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However,  $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which would be a fair compromise and still allow me to make a profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
