"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, and there's room for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can try to get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, recognizing its worth to you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still too high. I have more rounds to negotiate, so I'll continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However,  $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which would be a fair compromise and still allow me to make a profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
