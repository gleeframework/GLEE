"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, recognizing its worth to you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However,  $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which would be a fair compromise and still allow me to make a profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
