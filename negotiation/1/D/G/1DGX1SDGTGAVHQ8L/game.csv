"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe could be of great interest to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I understand it holds similar value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is certainly a tempting offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this opportunity. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm prepared to accept $950000. This is a compromise that still allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",920000.0,Bob,4,
