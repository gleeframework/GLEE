"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.5,Alice,5,
