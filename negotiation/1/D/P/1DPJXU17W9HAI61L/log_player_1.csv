"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $100, but it gives Bob room to counteroffer.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to continue exploring that possibility. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counter-offering at $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little lower than I'd hoped for, it's a decent price and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  $135 is a good outcome, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
