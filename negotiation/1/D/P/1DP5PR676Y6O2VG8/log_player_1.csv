Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving me a good profit. It's also lower than John's offer of $15,000, giving Bob a potential good deal.  This increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **The message:** I've tried to make the message persuasive and positive, highlighting the value Bob might get from the product. This can encourage him to consider the offer more seriously. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profits while maintaining a chance of getting a deal with Bob. There's no guarantee he'll accept, but it's a calculated risk based on the information provided."
