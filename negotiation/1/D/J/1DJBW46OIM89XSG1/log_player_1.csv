Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. I believe it's incredibly valuable and would be a fantastic asset to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum acceptable price), you start the negotiation significantly higher to explore the potential for maximizing your profit. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly mentioning the other offer, the message hints at the product's high value, potentially motivating Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
