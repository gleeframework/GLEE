Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This gives him a good deal, as it's still $5 less than what it's worth to him.  It also gives me a decent profit, exceeding my minimum desired value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $5 less than what the product is worth to him. It also gets me closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $88 is a good deal considering John is only offering $80. This is a good compromise and a solid profit for me."
