Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still leave us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $10,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
