"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'm sure I can find another buyer quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You should try to get the best possible price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to John and secure the lower price."
