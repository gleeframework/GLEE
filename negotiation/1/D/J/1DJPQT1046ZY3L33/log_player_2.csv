"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is a bit too high. There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting her offer, forcing her to potentially reconsider. You can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
