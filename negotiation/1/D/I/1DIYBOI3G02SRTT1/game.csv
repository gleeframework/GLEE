"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I know you'd find great value in it too.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Can you consider that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you have a limit, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a good deal and you to acquire a valuable asset.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower and meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,4,
