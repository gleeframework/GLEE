"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy allows for potential gains while not immediately scaring Bob away.  I'm also being positive and encouraging to help build a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round.  I'm not going to sell to John yet because I still think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for some compromise. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $88.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $88 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get a little more. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I think there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $88 is still a bit too low. How about we compromise at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still within a range that I think is reasonable.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to Bob, and emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us. I'm hoping to close the deal in this round."
