Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit greater than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering with $100. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $92 is still a good profit and higher than what John is offering.  The risk of continuing the negotiation and ending up with nothing is too high at this point."
