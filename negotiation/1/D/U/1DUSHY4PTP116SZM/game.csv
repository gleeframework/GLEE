"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this price is more reflective of the true worth you'll gain from this asset.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant price reduction. To be frank, anything below $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  If you're unable to meet that, I might need to explore other options.",900000.0,Alice,5,
