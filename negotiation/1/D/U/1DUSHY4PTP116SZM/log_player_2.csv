"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this price is more reflective of the true worth you'll gain from this asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant price reduction. To be frank, anything below $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  If you're unable to meet that, I might need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at a price point too far above your maximum. She's indicated a willingness to walk away, and you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John."
