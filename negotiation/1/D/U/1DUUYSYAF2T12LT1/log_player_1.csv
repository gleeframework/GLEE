{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving some room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profits, but also understand that Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering $130, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to make a good profit."
