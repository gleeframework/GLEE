# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to your operation.  My asking price is $1,150,000. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than what John is offering. It's a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $100,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
