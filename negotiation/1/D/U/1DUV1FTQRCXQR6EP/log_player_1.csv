Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $150 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, and for me to potentially still make a profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below both my minimum price ($120) and his own perceived value ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my target price, while still leaving some room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Compromise):** By suggesting $110, I am showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my absolute minimum. This tactic can be effective in moving the negotiation forward. 
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:**  While $110 is still above Bob's perceived value, it's close enough that he might be willing to stretch his budget, especially if he's eager to get the product. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  This price point still allows me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It seems unlikely that he'll be willing to meet my price point.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of missing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand where you're coming from, but $75 is just too low for me. I know this product is worth more, and I wouldn't be able to let it go for less than $100. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message conveys firmness - I have a bottom line. But, it's not presented as an ultimatum, maintaining a chance Bob will accept.
* **Justification:** By stating it's my final offer *and* re-emphasizing the product's worth, I'm hoping to nudge Bob towards a deal.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slight):** $100 is a small concession, but still profitable for me. It signals I'm willing to negotiate, but within reason.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this, it's likely time to sell to John. Prolonged haggling may not be worth the potential $20 gain, especially with a guaranteed buyer."
