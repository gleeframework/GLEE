"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential ROI for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $700,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation and I want to be fair.  While I'm confident the product will bring you a significant return on your investment exceeding $1,000,000, I'm prepared to make a substantial move.  Let's settle this right now at $950,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? I'll do $825,000.",825000.0,Bob,6,
