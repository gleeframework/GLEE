"Hi Alice, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,500?  I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500. This is still a fair price for the value you'll receive from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This would allow me to stay within my budget and hopefully, we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
