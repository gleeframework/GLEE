"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, I'm not able to accept your initial price.  I'm interested in buying the product for $9,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $10,000. While it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's important to remember that Bob has 10 rounds and can always choose to buy from John if no deal is reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above it.  Since Bob has 10 rounds and can always buy from John, it makes sense to continue negotiating for a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might come down further to make the deal happen."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you $10,250 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $10250, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I can throw in some additional support and training for the product, which would normally cost $500. I'll include this as a value-added bonus, so the total price would be $10750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,750 with additional support and training is tempting, Bob is getting close to his limit.  He's already had several rounds of negotiation and is only two rounds away from having to buy from John at his set price.  The additional support and training might be valuable, but they aren't worth the extra $750 to Bob.  He's better off buying from John, saving $750 and ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
