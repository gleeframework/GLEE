Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly hints at its worth to Bob, justifying the higher asking price. 
* **Alternative Option:** By stating she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, starting a negotiation.

While Alice knows John will buy the product for $15,000, there's no harm in trying to get a higher price from Bob first."
