``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming to get the product for $12,000 or less, and $14,000 is still too high. You can try to negotiate with Alice further."

I'm offering Alice $12,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that John is willing to sell it to me for $12,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to stay within my price range."

Alice's offer is still too high. While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm not willing to pay more than $12,500. I will counteroffer again."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $12,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to go much higher. This also gives us a middle ground to negotiate from."

Alice is still unwilling to budge. At this point, the price is getting too close to my limit, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. I will buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
