Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question allows Bob to either accept the offer or respond with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my budget around $80. Would you be able to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$80 is too low:** Selling for $80 would be below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. By rejecting his initial offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially reaching a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great price for this product, and I think we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's desired price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Empathy and Justification:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget and highlight the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation."
