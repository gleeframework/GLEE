"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and counteroffering.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is starting his counteroffer lower than Alice's offer, indicating he's serious about getting a better price. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $10,500 is still a good profit for Alice (above her $10,000 value) and leaves room for some negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message keeps the negotiation friendly while expressing Bob's desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11000. This reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's concession:** While Alice has lowered her offer, she's still asking for a price higher than Bob's ideal. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob can still try to push for a lower price. He has 7 rounds left to get closer to his target.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John at this point would be more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,750 is the absolute best I can offer.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:**  The price is closer to Alice's offer but still below her $11,000 proposal. 
* **Pressure:**  The message hints at a final offer, potentially pushing Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10875. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has lowered her offer significantly from the starting point, and is now only $375 above Bob's ideal price.
* **Meeting in the middle:** The offer is effectively a midpoint between Bob's last counteroffer and Alice's last offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might not budge further, leading to a potential deadlock and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time factor:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer guarantees a purchase at a reasonable price."
