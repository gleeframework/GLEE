"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's best to reject and counteroffer to save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While $1,300,000 is better than $1,500,000, it's still above your budget and you can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but if she won't budge, you can always go with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is a good price, but you can still get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
