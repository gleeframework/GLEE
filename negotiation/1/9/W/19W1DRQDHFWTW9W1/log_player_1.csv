Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $80, so $100 is a reasonable starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially earn more if Bob is willing to pay a bit more.
* **It doesn't immediately push him to John:**  By starting at a price he might consider, you encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth pushing for a better price and seeing if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get closer to what we're looking for."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $87.5 is tempting, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm determined to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again, at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $88. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are not worth the risk of him rejecting my offer again.  While $88 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120 and John is guaranteed to buy at that price. It's time to move on and sell to John."
