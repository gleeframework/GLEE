"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is excellent, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I can do $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is as low as I can go. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
