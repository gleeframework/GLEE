"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value this product can bring to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to meet you at $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from the $975000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and my previous offer of $1025000. Let's try $1000000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
