Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** $11,500 gives Bob a $1,500 discount, which is a significant saving and might be enough to convince him.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob refuses, Alice doesn't lose anything because she has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price."
