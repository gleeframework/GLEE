"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way beyond my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers exceptional [mention a key feature or benefit] which sets it apart. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product has great features, but $16,000 is still above what I'm willing to pay.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $12,000? This offer stands until the end of the next round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has given an ultimatum and is unlikely to move much higher than $12,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's risky. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
