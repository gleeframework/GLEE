Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, potentially getting closer to my desired price.  
* **John as an Option:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $15,000 provides leverage in my negotiations with Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I can use John's interest to push for a higher price or simply walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I still have John as a backup buyer willing to pay a much higher price. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will make a counteroffer closer to my initial offer of $12,000 to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $12,000 to $11,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price relatively high.
* **Reasoning:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move a little closer to my desired price. The $11,000 offer leaves a bit of wiggle room for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  I still have John as a backup option, which gives me the confidence to hold firm on a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget for $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal goal. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further lowering the price or potentially ending up with a deal below my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees a significantly higher profit and avoids any further negotiation."
