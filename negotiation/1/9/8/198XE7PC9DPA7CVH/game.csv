"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $900,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is still a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about $700,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
