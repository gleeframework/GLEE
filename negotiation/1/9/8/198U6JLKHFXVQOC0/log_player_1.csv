"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This price is a significant markup, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get more, and the risk of selling to John for $1,000,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profit.  I hope this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I would like to get a bit more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm worried about losing this deal entirely.  The risk of selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming more significant, and accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit."
