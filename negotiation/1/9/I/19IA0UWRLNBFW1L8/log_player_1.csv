Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $135, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $120 but still lower than my minimum value of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

By starting slightly above Bob's perceived value, I aim to secure a good price while leaving some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $135 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Lower:** Bob's counteroffer of $125 is still below my minimum value of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm also aware that John is willing to buy for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer right away. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $125 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130? That would still allow me to make a fair profit, and hopefully, it works for your budget."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $135 to $130. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price is still above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to further negotiation. 

I believe that $130 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to either counter again or move on to John."
