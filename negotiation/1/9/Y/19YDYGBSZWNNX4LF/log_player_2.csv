You have three options:

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John, who is offering a price within Bob's budget.  There is no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price."
