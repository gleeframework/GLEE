Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a slightly lower price than Bob's maximum allows for some negotiation if needed. He might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle closer to his valuation.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob hesitate. A slightly lower price increases the likelihood of him accepting immediately.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer, avoiding the need to sell to John for a lower price."
