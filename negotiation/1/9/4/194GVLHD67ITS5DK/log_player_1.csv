Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $1,125,000. This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000. How about $1,112,500?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,112,500 is still a good deal and much better than John's offer. It's important to close the deal before I risk losing both buyers."
