"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum price is $120, and Alice is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to accept the offer. There's no benefit to rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
