Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to start by aiming higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A starting price of $1,500,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Confident language:** Using language like ""exclusive opportunity"" and expressing confidence in the product's value can encourage Bob to take the offer seriously.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell the product quickly, you might offer a price closer to John's offer to ensure a sale."
