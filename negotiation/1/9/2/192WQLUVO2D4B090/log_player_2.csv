I'm starting with a lowball offer of $10,000.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, and I'm hoping it will encourage her to come down a bit."

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we're running out of time. I'm going to buy from John.  While it would be nice to get it for a bit less, it's better to secure the product than to risk losing it entirely."
