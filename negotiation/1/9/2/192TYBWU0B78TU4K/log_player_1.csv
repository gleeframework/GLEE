Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to be made if you sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's valuation while still ensuring you get a good deal.  Going too high might make Bob reject the offer.

**The Offer**

Here's a possible offer that balances these factors:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can make a real difference in your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Strong Opening:**  It positions the product as valuable and beneficial to Bob's business.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 gives you a significant profit ($150,000 above your minimum) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($50,000 less than his valuation). 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage.  You can subtly imply you have other interested parties without revealing specific details."
