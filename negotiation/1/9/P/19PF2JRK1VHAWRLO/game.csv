"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has value, your asking price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap between our valuations is still too wide. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering the potential risks and rewards. ",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000, which is my absolute floor.  This is a significant concession on my part and represents a very attractive offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
