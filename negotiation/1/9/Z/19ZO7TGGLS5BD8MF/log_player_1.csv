Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This would be a fair price considering the product's potential and my willingness to close the deal quickly. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
