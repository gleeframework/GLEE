Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.

```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This is because Bob has consistently refused to meet my minimum price of $15,000, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price and avoids further negotiations."
