{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to get as close to that $10,000 mark as possible while still ensuring a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer.  It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in it and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price,  $8,500 is still better than the $8,000 I'd get from John. It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or even losing the sale entirely."
