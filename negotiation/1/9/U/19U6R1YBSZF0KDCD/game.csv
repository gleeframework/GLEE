"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a price that's below market value, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This still gives you a significant discount and ensures we both get a good outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900000 is closer to where I need to be, but I still need a bit more to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $925000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
