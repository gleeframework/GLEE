"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but it's still above my desired price range. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth exploring if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my target price, but I still have some room to negotiate. I'm not yet ready to buy from John as I might be able to get a better price from Alice. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  $850,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price reflects the product's value to me while still giving you a good profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my target price, I still have room to negotiate and get a better deal. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, so I'll counteroffer one more time before considering his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to land closer to $825,000. This price allows for both of us to gain something from the deal. Let's see if we can make this final compromise to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's ultimatum:** Alice has made it clear that she's unwilling to go lower than $850,000 and will sell to John if I don't accept.
* **John's price:** Buying from John would cost me $1,200,000, significantly more than Alice's final offer.
* **Negotiation progress:** Although I'm not thrilled with the price, it's closer to my target price, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.

**Conclusion:**  It's best to accept Alice's offer to secure the product at a price that's still better than buying from John."
