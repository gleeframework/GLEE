"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  $850,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price reflects the product's value to me while still giving you a good profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to land closer to $825,000. This price allows for both of us to gain something from the deal. Let's see if we can make this final compromise to close the deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,7,
