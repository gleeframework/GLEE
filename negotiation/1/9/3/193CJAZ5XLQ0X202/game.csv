"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest in a range that's slightly more cost-effective for my business. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product. This would still allow me to acquire it while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
