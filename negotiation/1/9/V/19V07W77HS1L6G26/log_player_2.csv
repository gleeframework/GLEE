"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's asking $14,000. That's already above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to my maximum budget, I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a good compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
