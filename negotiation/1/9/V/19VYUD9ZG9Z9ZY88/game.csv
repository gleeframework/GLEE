"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. How about we try $10,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget of $15,000.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's meet halfway again. How about $10,750? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to finalizing the deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to stay within my budget. How about we try $10,500 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",10500.0,Bob,6,
