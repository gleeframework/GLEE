,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $13,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can you meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. This still gives you a significant savings on the value of the product. Let's make a deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can we make a deal?",13000.0,Bob,6,
