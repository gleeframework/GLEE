Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we want to start with a price closer to our minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or allows us to slightly lower the price and still make a good profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $140 positions it as a potential deal for Bob if he values it even slightly more than $80 (which is possible, we only have his minimum valuation).
* **Backup Plan:** We have the security of John as a buyer, ensuring we won't go below our minimum price. This allows us to confidently negotiate with Bob. 
 
By starting the negotiation at $140, we maximize our chances of getting a price closer to our desired amount while still leaving room to make a deal with Bob."
