"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1.5 million to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a significant profit margin while still providing me with a very good return on my investment.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
