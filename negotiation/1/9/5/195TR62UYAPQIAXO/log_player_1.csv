Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While you could start at $120, offering it slightly lower at $119 might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and be more likely to accept. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Starting too low (e.g., $105) could insult Bob or make him think the product is less valuable.

This strategy aims to get the highest price possible from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
