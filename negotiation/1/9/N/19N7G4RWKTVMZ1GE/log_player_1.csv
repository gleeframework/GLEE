Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum selling price to John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also ensures I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd rather sell to him than no one, it's not worth losing $50 when I can get $150 from John. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm willing to lower my price, but I need to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too low. While $110 is better than $100, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is the best outcome for me. I will sell the product to John."
