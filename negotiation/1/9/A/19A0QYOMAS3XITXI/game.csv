"I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",11500.0,Alice,5,
