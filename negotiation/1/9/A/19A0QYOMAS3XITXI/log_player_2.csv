"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a competitive price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but the price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range for negotiation. This gives me room to increase my offer if needed while aiming for a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, $11,000 is still above my budget and John's offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to stay below my maximum budget. By suggesting $9,000, I'm testing her flexibility and leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice increased her price and stated this is her final offer. This indicates she is unlikely to come down to a price that would be beneficial for me. John's offer of $10,000 is a better deal at this point."
