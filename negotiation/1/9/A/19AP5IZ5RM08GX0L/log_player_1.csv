Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I can potentially make more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had two rounds of negotiation and it doesn't seem like he's going to budge much further. Since John is offering my full asking price, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
