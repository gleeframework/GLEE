# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a significant discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While $1,150,000 is better than $1,200,000, it's still above my target price. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.

Alice has come back to her original price of $1,200,000.  It seems we've hit a stalemate.  It's better to go with John at this point, as his price is the maximum I'm willing to pay."
