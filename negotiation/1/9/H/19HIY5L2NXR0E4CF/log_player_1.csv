"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm initially offering it at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  I'm better off seeing if he'll move closer to my range.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider letting it go for $13,500."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This offer stands as a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll try one more time to get a bit more.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate the movement.  How about we split the difference between our last two numbers and call it $12,375? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12375}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,375 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about $11,800? I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one. Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate, but he's still a bit shy of my absolute minimum.  While there's a chance I could squeeze a little more out of him, it's getting risky.  

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses.  Selling to John guarantees I hit my minimum and avoids the potential of Bob walking away altogether."
