"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product's value. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more wiggle room.  How about $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value to me and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're looking for a bit more wiggle room, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9,700. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9700.0,Alice,7,
