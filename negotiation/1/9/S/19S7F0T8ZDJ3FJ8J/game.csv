"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This shows a genuine desire to reach an agreement, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $13,500 is still out of my range. I'm willing to offer $11,500. This is a significant increase from my last offer, demonstrating my desire to reach a deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
