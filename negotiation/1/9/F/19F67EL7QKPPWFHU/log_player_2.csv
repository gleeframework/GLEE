**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to a price I'd be willing to pay, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's $100 offer.  I've already invested time in this negotiation, and continuing to haggle might not result in significant savings. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best price available."
