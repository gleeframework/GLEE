"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product looks great, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $13,000 represents a fair valuation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $11,500? I believe this reflects the product's true value and presents a win-win scenario for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is still a little too steep for me. Could you do $10,500? I think that would be a great price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
