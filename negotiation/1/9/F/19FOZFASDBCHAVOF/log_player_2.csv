(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've managed to negotiate Alice down considerably. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's getting close to the point where further haggling might be counterproductive. Accepting at $108.75 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
