Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. Would that be feasible?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. How about we compromise at $11,500? That's a fair price for a product of this quality, and it's still a good deal for you

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. How about we meet at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable

Alice seems pretty set on staying above $11,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
