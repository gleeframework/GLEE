"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see that you're serious about this product. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows us to close the deal fairly.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
