"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $102.50. Can you consider that?",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $110 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",107.5,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $105, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,6,
