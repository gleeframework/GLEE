I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my profits.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."

{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also allows me to earn more than selling to John."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter again and see if we can reach a deal that's more favorable to me."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,250,000. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping we can reach a compromise that's better for both of us."

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of getting a lower price or having to sell to John."
