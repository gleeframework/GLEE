Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm looking to make a deal, $10,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $11,000 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, considering its value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too far apart on price.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $11,200, but I need to get at least that much to make this worthwhile. I think this price is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I can do $10,900, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $10,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to go with a guaranteed sale to John than to risk further negotiations with Bob and possibly lose out on a better deal."
