"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price since the product is only worth $10,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal.  Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $11,500, but still leaves room for some negotiation. This price is also below Bob's maximum budget of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,700 is still within Bob's budget, and only $200 higher than Bob's previous counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, minimizing risk and saving time."
