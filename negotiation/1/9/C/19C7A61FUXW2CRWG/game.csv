"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $8,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. I think that's a fair price for a great product like this. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While $10,500 is better than your initial offer, I'm still just a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $9,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to make the purchase if you agree.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to budge from $10,000. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, and I'm getting a bit concerned that we're wasting each other's time. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $10,000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
