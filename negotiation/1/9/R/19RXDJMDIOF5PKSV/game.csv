,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
