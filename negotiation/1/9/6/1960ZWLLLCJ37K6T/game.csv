"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product, given its value to me.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  I believe this offer reflects a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $775,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Let's try one more time to meet in the middle. I'll meet you at $800,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
