"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do $7500? I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my price range.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget constraint. I can't go as low as $7500 but I'm willing to come down to $9000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $8500?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can realistically offer.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
