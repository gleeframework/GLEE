Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering it at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum ($100) and John's offer. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it or counteroffers very low, we know he might be more price-sensitive and we can adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly less than what you could potentially get ($140).  You have room to negotiate, especially knowing the product is worth $150 to him. Rejecting his offer and providing a counter-offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm also confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a win-win for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. By suggesting $130, you're splitting the difference between your previous offer and his counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  You're not completely giving in to his price, showing that you believe in the value of the product.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This offer still keeps you well above your minimum sale price and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, based on my research and other offers, I believe I can secure the product for $125. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $125 is a solid profit, significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($100) and John's standing offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob has shown he's willing to pay a reasonable price, but he might have a hard limit. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth and secures the sale, preventing you from potentially losing out on other opportunities while negotiating."
