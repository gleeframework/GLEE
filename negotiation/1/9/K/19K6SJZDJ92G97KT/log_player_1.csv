"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate, while also reflecting the product's value to me.  I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding on further steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130 to Bob. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise. If Bob rejects again, I'll consider selling to John to avoid going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer in the next round. However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a serious alternative, especially if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115 to Bob. This is a compromise, halfway between his offer and my minimum acceptable price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to earn as much as possible. If Bob rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $120. Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. While I'd prefer to make more, John's offer is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirements.  I'm running out of time, and I want to secure a deal."
