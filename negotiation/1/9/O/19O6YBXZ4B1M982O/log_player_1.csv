Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,725,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to meet in the middle, which is a reasonable negotiation tactic. However, we're still significantly above our minimum acceptable price.  Let's hold firm for now and see if we can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  How about we settle on $1,775,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we're still above our minimum, Bob is consistently sticking to his 'meet in the middle' strategy. This offer is significantly closer to our asking price than his original, and continuing to push risks losing the deal.  It's a good outcome, so it's time to accept."
