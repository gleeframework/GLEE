I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'm still more than $100,000 above my minimum with Bob, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my offer slightly to keep the negotiation moving, but I'm still well above my minimum. I want to see if Bob will budge a little closer to my price."

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer, and I'm willing to risk losing him for a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000.  This keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob a chance to get closer to my desired price without risking losing the deal entirely."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's close to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price from Bob. He's already shown that he's willing to negotiate and his value for the product is much higher than what he's offering. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,100,000 and I think with a few more rounds I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer and only slightly lower than my previous one.  It's a good balance between pushing Bob higher and ensuring that we don't reach an impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Unfortunately, Bob's final offer is too low for me to accept. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's a lower price than I was hoping for, but it's still a good deal considering my minimum price and the fact that I'm already in the 10th round."
