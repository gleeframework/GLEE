,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's close this now, what do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $92.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",92.0,Bob,4,
