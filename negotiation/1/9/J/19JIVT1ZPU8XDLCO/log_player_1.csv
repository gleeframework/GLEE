{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $13,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still reasonable. This allows room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think we can work out a deal that's fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is still within a reasonable range for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is really my maximum, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
