"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $13,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  
* If negotiations fail, Bob can always buy from John for $12,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is still within a reasonable range for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* While it's a good compromise, Bob can still try to get a better deal.
* Bob can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his budget. If that fails, he can always buy from John for $12,000."
