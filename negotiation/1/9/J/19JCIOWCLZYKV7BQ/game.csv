"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer the product to you for $100.50. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",100.5,Alice,5,
