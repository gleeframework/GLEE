"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.  ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're not happy with $12000, but $13500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $12750? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",12750.0,Bob,4,
