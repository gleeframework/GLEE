"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  You want to try and get it lower.  It's also valuable to see how much Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $15 reduction is a good starting point, and it leaves room for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but $85 is still too high. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a better price. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $82. While I'd prefer to get it even lower,  it's getting close to my acceptable price point. I'm saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, and there's a risk that I might not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. It's time to close the deal."
