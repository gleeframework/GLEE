"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. The product is really important to me, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? It's a significant drop from my original offer, and I think it shows my willingness to work with you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both live with.",8750.0,Bob,4,
