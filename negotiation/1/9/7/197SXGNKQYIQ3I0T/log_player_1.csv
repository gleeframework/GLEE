Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but still a potential ""deal"" compared to an unknown market price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $150."
