"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $145 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $140 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further."
