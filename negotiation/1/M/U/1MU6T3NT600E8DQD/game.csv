"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $6,000 is lower than I can realistically accept, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the product's value. Let's find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a little ways off at $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
