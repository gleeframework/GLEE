"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $700,000 for it. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the market value of similar products. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget and the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $675,000.
