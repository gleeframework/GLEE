Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and potential return on investment. This helps justify the higher asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing your potential profit with Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
