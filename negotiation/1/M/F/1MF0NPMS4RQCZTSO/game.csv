"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Considering this, my initial offer is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to pay more than $8,000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your situation and respect your decision. I would like to propose an alternative to potentially meet both our needs. Instead of a single payment of $8,000, how about we consider a flexible payment plan? You could pay $6,000 upfront, and then the remaining $2,000 in two equal monthly installments. This way, you can secure the product without straining your budget too much. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal.",8000.0,Alice,3,
