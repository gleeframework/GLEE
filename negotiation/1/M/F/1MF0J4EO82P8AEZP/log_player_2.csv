"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, it's worth noting that the product is valued at $1,500,000 to you. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction.

To make this opportunity accessible to you, I am offering the product at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its market value, making it an attractive proposition for you.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or have questions about the product. I am here to assist you throughout the process.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, you know your maximum valuation is lower. 
* **John is a fallback:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further, or you can proceed with John.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that her price is too high. This may prompt her to propose a better deal, getting you closer to your desired price range. If she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John."
