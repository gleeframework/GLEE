"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to sell the product for $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
