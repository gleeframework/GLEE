"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $125.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is better than the product's value to her ($150), you know you can get it for a guaranteed $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and taking the sure thing."
