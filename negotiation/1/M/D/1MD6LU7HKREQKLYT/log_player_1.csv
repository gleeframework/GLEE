{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the value the product offers. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $175 is a high starting point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for some negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest. This indicates there's room for negotiation.  
* **Avoiding immediate loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open with the potential for a better price.  

**Next Step:**  I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  I think this price is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:** $130 is still above my minimum of $150, but it's a significant step towards meeting Bob's offer. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes fairness and value, keeping the negotiation positive.
* **Building on interest:** I acknowledge Bob's interest and reiterate my belief in the product's value. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** While $130 is a compromise, it leaves space for some wiggle room if Bob isn't yet satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'd be willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation continues:**  While Bob has moved closer to my price, there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance that with a counteroffer, I can secure a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising further:** $125 is a further compromise, showing willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Final offer positioning:** I'm framing this as my ""absolute lowest"",  creating a sense of finality to encourage acceptance.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to reinforce the deal's potential.

**Next Step:** This counteroffer is a significant step towards Bob's price point. Depending on Bob's response, I'm prepared to consider selling to John for $150 if Bob rejects my final offer."
