"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $12,000 limit as possible. Offering $12,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still likely within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and potentially a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit.  While he could accept and get the product, it's still not the best deal. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, Bob can continue to try to negotiate a lower price. He's still within the 10 rounds and has the option to buy from John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit, but he wants to try to get a better price.  Offering $13,000 is a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to Alice's offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.  This strategy attempts to find a middle ground where both parties might be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively worse for Bob. He's already rejected several offers that were closer to his limit.  At this point,  Alice's offer is too far above Bob's limit, and the likelihood of her coming down to a price he's comfortable with is decreasing. It's better for Bob to buy from John at a price he's already comfortable with and secure the product.  This decision avoids further negotiation and ensures a predictable outcome."
