{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $25,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 25000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I will reject and counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $20,000? This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk running out of rounds.  It's better to accept and secure the sale."
