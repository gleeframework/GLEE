"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle on $975,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
