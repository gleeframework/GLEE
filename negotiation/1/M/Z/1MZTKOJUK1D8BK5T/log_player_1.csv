{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob.  I'm starting at my desired price, knowing it's more than he's willing to pay. This strategy sets the stage for potential negotiation and hopefully leads to a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I can go down to $140, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price to $140. This is a compromise, but it still keeps me above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will find this price acceptable, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop that low.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
