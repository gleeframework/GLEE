Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1300000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,250,000, which is still higher than my minimum acceptable price but lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's lower than I initially hoped for, it's still a profitable deal. It's also worth noting that continued negotiation might result in a lower price or a protracted process. Selling to John would guarantee a higher price, but I risk losing the opportunity to potentially earn more with Bob.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice at this point."
