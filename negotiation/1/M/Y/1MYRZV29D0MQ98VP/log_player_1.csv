Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. By expressing your belief in the product's value, you try to establish its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and while it's tempting to take the $10,000, you can likely do better by continuing to negotiate. You have a solid backup option with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, and considering you have a backup buyer willing to pay $12,000, accepting Bob's offer of $11,500 is the best option.  It maximizes your profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal to John."
