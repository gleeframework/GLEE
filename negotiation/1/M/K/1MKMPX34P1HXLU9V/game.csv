"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your operations. While I can't disclose specifics about the product just yet, I can assure you that it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000, which represents a significant discount from its true value. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know your decision by [Date/Time].",1250000.0,Alice,1,
