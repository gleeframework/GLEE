Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows a willingness to compromise, which can be important in building a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I need to meet my minimum goal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try to push him higher or move on to John if I can't."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to make a deal.  Let me know if you're able to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit high at $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum goal.  I've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely. It's better to secure a sale at this price than to gamble on a potentially better outcome with John."
