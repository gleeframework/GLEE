"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to make a deal.  Let me know if you're able to meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to get closer to his target of $1,000,000."
