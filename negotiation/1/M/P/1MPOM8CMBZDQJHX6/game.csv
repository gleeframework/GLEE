"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $2,000,000 represents a fair reflection of the product's value, I understand your budgetary constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this revised price point offers a mutually beneficial opportunity.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
