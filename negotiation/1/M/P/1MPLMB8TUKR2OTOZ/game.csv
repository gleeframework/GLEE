"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1100000? This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in the product. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
