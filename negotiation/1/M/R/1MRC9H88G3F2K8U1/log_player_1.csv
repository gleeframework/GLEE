Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Alice has a strong backup offer from John at $10,000, so she can afford to be a bit bolder in her initial offer to Bob."
