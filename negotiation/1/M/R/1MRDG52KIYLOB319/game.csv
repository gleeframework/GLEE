"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $875,000 is closer, my budget is still at $850,000. I'm confident this product holds significant value for both of us. If you're open to reaching an agreement, I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I still believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $860,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",860000.0,Alice,5,
