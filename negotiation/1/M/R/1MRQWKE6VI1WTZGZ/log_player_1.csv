"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a starting price of $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a high price initially allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Value Statement:**  Mentioning the product's value to me (at least $1,000,000) gives Bob an idea of its potential worth, but also subtly hints at my willingness to negotiate.
* **Openness:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I've only had one round of negotiation, and it's worth exploring if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,350,000?  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not accepting Bob's initial price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering a price in the middle of our previous offers creates a sense of compromise and fairness.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Highlighting the product's value for Bob keeps the focus on its potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. Can we meet at $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired range, I've only had a few rounds and there's still room for improvement.  I'm confident I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still focused on $1,250,000, but I'm only a small distance away at $1,300,000.  This is a truly unique opportunity, and I believe you'll see the value in investing a little more. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by closing the gap, but still pushing for a price higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I continue to emphasize the uniqueness and value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the slightly higher price.
* **Open-ended Question:** The question ""What do you say?"" invites Bob to engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not at $1300000. Can we meet at $1275000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** $1,275,000 is getting close to my goal, but with only 4 rounds remaining, I still have some leverage.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe I can still get a better price with a bit more negotiation. I'm also aware of the value of the product to me, which is at least $1,000,000, so a price below $1,300,000 doesn't feel quite right yet.
* **Risk Management:** While selling to John is an option, I'm not yet willing to settle for $1,000,000. I'm still hopeful that I can push for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $1,285,000. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe you'll see the value in this product for years to come. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1285000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility while staying firm. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to accept.
* **Future Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's long-term value, which may sway his decision.
* **Closing Statement:**  The ""Let's seal the deal"" statement adds urgency and suggests that this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1285000. Can we meet at $1260000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing.  However, $1,260,000 is still below my minimum target price of $1,300,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Even though Bob has been stubborn, there's still a chance I can push for a higher price.  The fact that he's continued to negotiate suggests he's interested in the product.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my last resort.  I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're down to the wire here. I'm willing to go down to $1,270,000 for this unique product.  This is my final offer. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1270000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  With only one round left, I need to make a strong final statement.  
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my last offer to show flexibility.
* **Urgency:**  The ""final offer"" statement creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm again highlighting the product's uniqueness, hoping to remind Bob of its value.

**Outcome:**  This is a risky move, as I'm pushing hard for a higher price. If Bob rejects, my only option is to sell to John. But, I believe the pressure of the final round and the ""final offer"" statement might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'll meet you at $1250000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation, and I have to make a decision.
* **Below Target:**  Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is still below my target price of $1,300,000.
* **Risk of No Sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk not selling the product at all, as he's stated he'll explore other options. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a significant sum and meets my minimum requirement.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of losing the sale entirely is too high.  Selling to John is the most logical choice to ensure I get at least a substantial profit."
