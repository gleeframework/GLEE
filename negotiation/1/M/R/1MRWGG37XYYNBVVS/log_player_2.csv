"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. It holds significant value for us, and we believe it could be equally valuable to you. After careful consideration, we are offering the product to you for $1,200,000. We understand its worth to you might be different, but we hope this offer presents an opportunity for both of us to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You are aiming to spend no more than $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my best and final offer, as I have other options available."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but it doesn't align with our valuation. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is our best offer considering the value we place on the product and the interest it has generated. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above your target of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to drop below her valuation significantly.  It's more efficient to accept John's offer and get the product for your desired price."
