This is the optimal decision for a couple of reasons:

* **Matching Your Alternative:** Bob's offer now matches the exact amount John is willing to pay. There is no further financial benefit to continuing negotiations or holding out for a higher price from Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Further rounds risk prolonging the negotiation and delaying the receipt of payment. 

While there's a slim chance Bob might offer slightly more in subsequent rounds, the risk of him walking away and the time value of money make accepting his current offer the most logical choice."
