It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my ideal range. This will give me a better chance of getting a good deal without immediately jumping to John's price."

Alice is still above my ideal price, and I can likely negotiate a better price. I'll make another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,050,000. It's a reasonable compromise, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still aiming for a price that saves me money."

Alice is still coming in higher than my ideal price. While her offer is closer to my range, I think I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll make another counteroffer."

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her latest offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but still keeps me below her original asking price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to seal the deal."

We've reached a stalemate. Alice is unwilling to budge below her initial asking price of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to John. While his price is higher, at least it's a guaranteed deal, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in an endless negotiation."
