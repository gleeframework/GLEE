Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Urgency & Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing the product's exclusivity can encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This initial offer is a strategic starting point. Depending on Bob's response and potential counter-offers, I (Alice) may adjust the price during negotiations to secure the best possible deal."
