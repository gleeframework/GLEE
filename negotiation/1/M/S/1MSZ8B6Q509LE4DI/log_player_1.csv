"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to try and push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$100 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by pushing for more.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
