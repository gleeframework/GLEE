Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $19,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($10,000), he might be willing to negotiate if the product offers unique benefits he hasn't considered.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, be prepared to counter with a lower price, gradually approaching your minimum acceptable price ($15,000)."
