Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He gets a $100,000 discount from its worth to him, and you make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
