"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is out of my price range. Considering the value to me, I can offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable price, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,800. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still outside my comfort zone.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  I believe this represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,7,
