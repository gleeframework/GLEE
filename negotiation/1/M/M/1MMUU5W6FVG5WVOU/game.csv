"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $14,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your value for it is $12,000. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my best counteroffer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
