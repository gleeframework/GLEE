"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product. This should leave room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than the value I want. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a deal I'm satisfied with. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I believe I can get a higher price."

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum and hopefully will encourage Bob to accept.  I'm getting close to the end of the rounds, so it's important to show flexibility to secure a deal."
