# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm not convinced that the product is worth $119 to me, especially since I'm looking to save as much money as possible. I think I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get it from John for $80.
