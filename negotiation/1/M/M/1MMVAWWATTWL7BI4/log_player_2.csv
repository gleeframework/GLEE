You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting his counteroffer by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This is a bold move, but Bob is aiming to establish a negotiation range quickly.  He's hoping Alice will see the value in getting a deal done, even if it means accepting a price slightly lower than her ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can continue to negotiate, potentially reaching a more favorable price. It's risky to buy from John at this point, as there's still room for improvement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product. He's hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties. This offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, making it more likely that she will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but there's still room to negotiate. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if a better deal can be reached. Buying from John at this point would leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum price. This is a calculated risk, but Bob is hoping that Alice will accept it rather than risk losing the deal altogether. He's also aware that buying from John for the same price is always an option if this offer is rejected."
