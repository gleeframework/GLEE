Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 price point is still significantly profitable for you while being attractive to Bob, as it's well below his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly."
