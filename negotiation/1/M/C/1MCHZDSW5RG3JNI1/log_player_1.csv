{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  I know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.

By offering the product at $14,999, I am aiming for the highest possible price Bob might be willing to pay while still ensuring I make more than he values the product for.  This strategy leaves me with a comfortable margin and a very high chance of selling to Bob."
