"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $82 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $75, which would be $78.50. It's still a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",78.5,Alice,5,
