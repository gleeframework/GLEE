Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see value in the product at $120, so he may be willing to pay a little more than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is closer to my desired price than my initial offer. Accepting his offer ensures I sell the product without risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
