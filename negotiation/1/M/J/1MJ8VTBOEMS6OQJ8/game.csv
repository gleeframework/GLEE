"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  I really think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
