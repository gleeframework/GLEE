I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer for it?,150.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,135.0
"I think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit above your target. How about we meet at $132.50? It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept.",132.5,Alice,5,,
