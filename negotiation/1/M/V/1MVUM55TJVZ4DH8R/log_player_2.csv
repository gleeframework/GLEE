"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. It's a unique opportunity that we believe could greatly benefit you. Given its value to us, we're offering it to you at a special price of $950,000. We understand its worth to you might be higher, but we hope this offer presents an attractive proposition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its value to me. I believe this price is fair, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer to better align with your budget. We are now offering the product at $875,000. This price reflects the value we place on the transaction while also accommodating your financial considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $875,000, which is only $75,000 above Bob's ideal price of $800,000. This is a good deal for Bob, considering he can buy from John for $1,000,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John. There is limited room for further negotiation, and continuing to reject offers could risk losing the deal altogether."
