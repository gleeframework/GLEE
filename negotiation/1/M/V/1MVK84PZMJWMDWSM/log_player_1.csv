Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but  $1,300,000 is my final offer.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $1250000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I will accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good deal and higher than what John is offering. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
