Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something mutually beneficial. How about we start at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to try to accommodate you while still ensuring we receive a fair value for our product. How does $100 sound as a compromise?
