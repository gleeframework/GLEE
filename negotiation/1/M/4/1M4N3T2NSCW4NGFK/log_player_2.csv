"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something mutually beneficial. How about we start at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price.  You're aiming for a lower price and can always go to John, so rejecting the offer is the best initial move.  You'll then try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to try to accommodate you while still ensuring we receive a fair value for our product. How does $100 sound as a compromise? It's slightly above your offer, but it also reflects the value we place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is the exact price John is selling the product for.  There is no need to negotiate further, as accepting the offer immediately saves time and ensures you get the product at your maximum price point."
