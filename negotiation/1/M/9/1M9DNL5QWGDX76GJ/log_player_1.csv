Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he will reach $120.  It's more profitable at this point to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
