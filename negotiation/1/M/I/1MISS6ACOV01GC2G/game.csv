"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000? It's still a good deal for both of us and allows me to stay closer to the product's true value. Let's try to close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
