"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so what do you think about $97.50?",97.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $95. It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
