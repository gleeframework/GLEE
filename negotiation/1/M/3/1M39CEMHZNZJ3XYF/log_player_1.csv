"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being a decent starting point.  I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding whether to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a good deal, too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $16,500 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my initial asking price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Bob walk away."
