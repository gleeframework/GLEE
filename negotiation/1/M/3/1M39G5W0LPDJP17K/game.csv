"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concern about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $105? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $102? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",102.0,Alice,5,
