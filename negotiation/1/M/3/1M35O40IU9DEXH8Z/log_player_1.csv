{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value, but still above your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while also making it clear that you are serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $11,000, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  We'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $12500. How about we try $12250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $12,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
