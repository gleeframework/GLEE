Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $139. I think it would be a great value at this price, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 139}
```

Reasoning:  Since I know Bob values the product at $120, I want to offer a price that is higher than that but still potentially attractive.  Offering it at $139 gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but still secures a profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
