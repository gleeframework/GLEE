"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to sell for less than $100, and there are still 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** A significant discount is offered to test Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message explains the reason for the counteroffer and demonstrates a genuine interest in the product. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $75 is still a decent price for Bob, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  It's still a great deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $85 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for further negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better deal if he continues to counter.
* **Strategic approach:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation dynamic and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price. 
* **Avoiding John's price:** Bob is trying to avoid paying John's price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $85 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $80?  I'm really hoping to make this work."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Reduction:** A smaller counteroffer ($80) shows Bob is serious but keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Reiterating his interest in the product keeps the conversation amicable. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** Leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
