"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm working with a limited budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a mutually beneficial deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair price that's closer to what I need and still represents a good deal for you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
