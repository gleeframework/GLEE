"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
