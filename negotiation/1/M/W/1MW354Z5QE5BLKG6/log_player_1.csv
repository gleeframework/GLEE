Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $850,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still too far below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, so let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is closer to my budget and still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

Although $825,000 is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! However, $825,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, as I mentioned before, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds remaining, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is a much better outcome for me."
