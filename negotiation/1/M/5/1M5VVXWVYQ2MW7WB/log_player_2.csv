"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, it's valued at $12,000 to me. Considering its worth to you, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you, aiming to provide you with significant value while ensuring a fair deal for us. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than her stated value, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with buying from John."
