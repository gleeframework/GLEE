Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to start high with Bob to see if you can maximize your profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he's interested but unwilling to pay the full price. This keeps the door open for a deal.
* **Confidence:**  The message implies the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down towards his perceived value of $10,000. You have the leverage of a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000."
