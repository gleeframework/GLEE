"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe we could find a mutually beneficial solution.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Could you consider reducing the price further to $12000? I believe this would be a more suitable price point for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
