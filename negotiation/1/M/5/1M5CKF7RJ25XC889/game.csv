"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your desired price. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in your price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This offer is in line with the value of the product to me and still allows you to profit from the sale.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target, but I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
