Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's high value without revealing your bottom line. This might make Bob more inclined to consider a price above his perceived value. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still space to negotiate down towards his $8,000 perceived value, while staying above your own minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  A lot depends on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style. A more aggressive approach might aim even higher initially, while a softer approach might start closer to $12,000."
