"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $150, but I want to see if I can get a higher price. I believe this is a fair starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I want to see if he's willing to go higher before accepting his offer. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my initial assessment of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $150 and closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
