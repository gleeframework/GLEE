Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

Bob is making a final counteroffer at his maximum price. He's willing to pay $1,000,000, but only if Alice accepts. This shows his seriousness while also highlighting the fact that he has a backup option with John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. Alice is not budging much, and Bob is now at risk of running out of rounds.  The price is too close to John's offer, and it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John at this point. This minimizes his risk and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
