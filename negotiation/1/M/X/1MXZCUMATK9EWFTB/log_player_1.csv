Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally advisable to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe the product is worth a significant amount. 
* **Anchor Price:** By starting at $120, we set an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind.  Even though he values it at $80, this starting point might make him more receptive to a counteroffer within the $80-$120 range.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer. We can then assess his response and decide our next move strategically.
* **John as a Backup:** Keep in mind that John is a guaranteed sale at $80.  This knowledge gives us leverage in the negotiation with Bob, allowing us to walk away from the deal if it's not beneficial enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $80 aligns perfectly with his stated valuation of the product. This means it's highly unlikely he'll be willing to go any higher.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  Our minimum acceptable price is $80. While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's a strong chance it will be a waste of time and potentially lead to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price. There's no risk of losing the sale or engaging in a prolonged negotiation.

**Therefore, it makes the most sense to cut our losses and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $80.**"
