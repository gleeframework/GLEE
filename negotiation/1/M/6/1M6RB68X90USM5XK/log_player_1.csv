Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects this offer, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount. I'll accept this offer and finalize the sale."
