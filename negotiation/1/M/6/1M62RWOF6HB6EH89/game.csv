"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $750000.  This is a significant opportunity, so let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $680000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",680000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $680000 is certainly a tempting price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $720000.  This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work.",720000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $720000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $700000. I think this is a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
