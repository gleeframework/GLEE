Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
