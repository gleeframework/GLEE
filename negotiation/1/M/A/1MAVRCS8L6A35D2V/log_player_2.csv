# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds immense value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you could be even greater. I am offering you the chance to own this product at a special price of $950,000. This is a significant discount from its original valuation, aiming to provide you with an exceptional deal while ensuring a substantial return on my investment. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
