"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $7,000?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,3,
