,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's a good compromise between what I want and what you're willing to pay. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $102. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $102, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $98 and $102. I'm offering a counteroffer of $100. It's the best I can do. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,7,
