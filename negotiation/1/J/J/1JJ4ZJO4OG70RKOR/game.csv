,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $130.  Let's try $131.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.",131.0,Alice,5,
