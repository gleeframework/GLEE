"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
