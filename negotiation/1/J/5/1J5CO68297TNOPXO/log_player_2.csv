I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and add substantial value to your portfolio. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs, is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true worth and the benefits it promises to bring.

Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and aligns with your financial planning. I am here to answer any questions you might have and assist you through the process.

Looking forward to your positive response,

You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
