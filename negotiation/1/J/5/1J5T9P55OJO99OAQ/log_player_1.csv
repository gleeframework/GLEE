Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in.  I'm asking for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a strong fallback option with John ($800,000), so she can afford to be a bit more ambitious in her initial offer to Bob."
