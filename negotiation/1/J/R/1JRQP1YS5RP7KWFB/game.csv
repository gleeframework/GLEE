"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find some common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $11,500 is still below my bottom line. Let's split the difference at $12,500.  This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
