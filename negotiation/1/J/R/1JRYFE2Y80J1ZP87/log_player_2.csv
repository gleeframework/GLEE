You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within my budget, I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and shows my serious intention to negotiate. While it might be rejected, it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a $1,000 savings for me. While I'd like to see if I can get a better deal, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  It's more likely that Alice won't go lower than $11,000, and I could end up buying from John for the full $12,000.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids unnecessary risk."
