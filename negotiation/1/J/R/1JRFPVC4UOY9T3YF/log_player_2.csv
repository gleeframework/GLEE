"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, or simply buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice or simply buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go above $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about getting the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is a great price for you, and it's still a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. While Alice is willing to go down to $12,000, Bob's maximum budget is $10,000. It's not worth continuing negotiations with Alice at this point. Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
