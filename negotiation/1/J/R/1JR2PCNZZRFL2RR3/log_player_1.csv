Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially settling on a price that's still very favorable for you.
* **Consider the Alternative:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 provides a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at $1,100,000 gives him a chance to save $100,000 while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum."
