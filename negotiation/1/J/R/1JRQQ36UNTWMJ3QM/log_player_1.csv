Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $175 for it. Interested?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is higher than what Bob values the product at, but it's still within a reasonable range where he might consider it if he believes it's worth more than he initially thinks. 
* **Below John's Offer:** The offer ensures you make a profit even if Bob rejects it since you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters."
