Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you the product for $725,000. This is the best I can do, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below $800,000.  At this point, it's better to cut our losses and buy from John for $800,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price and risks wasting valuable time."
