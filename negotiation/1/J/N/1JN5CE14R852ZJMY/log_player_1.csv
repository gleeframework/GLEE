"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $950,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn as much as possible. It's also within the realm of reason, considering Bob values the product at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's stuck at $850,000, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm also considering that if I reject this offer, I can still sell to John for $800,000, which is better than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a lower price than my last offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer and closer to the value I'm hoping to get. I think this is a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $850,000, this is a good opportunity to secure a sale.  Bob has come down to $825,000, which is only $25,000 less than what John would pay.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
