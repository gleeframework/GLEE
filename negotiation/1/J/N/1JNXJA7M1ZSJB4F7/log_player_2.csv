"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's still time to potentially get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still outside my range.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $10,250. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,750. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's getting closer, it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John. There are still a few rounds left, and a little more negotiation might yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to offer $10,100.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact I'm ready to close the deal.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. I've already discounted the price significantly, and I think this is a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There are only a few rounds left and it's unlikely that Alice will budge further.  To avoid going over budget, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for his maximum budget."
