Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $850,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer $800,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer is the same as what I could get from John, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale and avoid any further risk of rejection."
