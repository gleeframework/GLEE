"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $850,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer $800,000. Can you consider that?",800000.0,Bob,4,
