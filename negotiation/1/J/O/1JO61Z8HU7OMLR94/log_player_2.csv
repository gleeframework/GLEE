"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82. This is a final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?
