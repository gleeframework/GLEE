"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so he'll likely counteroffer. I'll keep an eye on the rounds and consider selling to John if the deal with Bob isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, while still being within my acceptable range. I'm confident that I can reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$13,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I've got six rounds left and can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm finally offering my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John and secure a guaranteed $15,000."
