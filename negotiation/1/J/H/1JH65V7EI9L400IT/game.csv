"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to  $1,100,000 to make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While that's a significant gap from my initial asking price, I understand the need for a fair deal. Considering the product's potential value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price point better reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
