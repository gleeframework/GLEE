"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to  $1,100,000 to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give myself room to negotiate upward. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I haven't committed to John's offer yet, so I have flexibility. If Alice is completely unreasonable, I can always go with John.
* **Gauging Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be and if a deal is even possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While that's a significant gap from my initial asking price, I understand the need for a fair deal. Considering the product's potential value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price point better reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down, $1,900,000 is still significantly more than my $1,000,000 limit and what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Slow Progress:**  Alice's counteroffer suggests she might be tough to negotiate with. I need to push harder to see if a deal is realistic.
* **John is My Safety Net:** I can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase, Firm Limit:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm serious but also sets a firm boundary. The significant increase from my last offer might entice her while making it clear I'm not budging beyond $1,250,000.
* **Time Pressure:** By implying this is my final offer, I'm subtly introducing time pressure, encouraging Alice to make a decision. 
* **John Remains an Option:** I'm still keeping John's offer in my back pocket if this counteroffer doesn't lead to a deal."
