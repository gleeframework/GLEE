Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. 
    * You earn $150,000 more than your minimum.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while acknowledging the value the product holds for Bob."
