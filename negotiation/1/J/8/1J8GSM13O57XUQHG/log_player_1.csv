Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum threshold. This is a good strategy because it leaves some room for negotiation without immediately risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's the closest I can get to meeting your needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
