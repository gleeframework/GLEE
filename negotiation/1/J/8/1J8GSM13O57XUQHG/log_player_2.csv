"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, and Alice's offer is higher than that.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's the closest I can get to meeting your needs. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has a guaranteed deal with John.  There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice."
