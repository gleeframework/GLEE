"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I'm glad you're confident in the product, but I believe we can still negotiate further. Would $100 be too much to ask for considering my budget constraints?",100.0,Bob,4,
