"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear we are unlikely to bridge the gap quickly. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant amount. Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
