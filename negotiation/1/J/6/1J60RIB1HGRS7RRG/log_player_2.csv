"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still a little too high.  Since I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $7,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,900. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target. I'm going to try to push for a lower price. I'm not desperate to buy right now, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $6,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $6,700. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 6700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,850. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $6,850, which is very close to my target price of $6,700.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer is the safest move, as I'm still getting a good deal compared to John's price."
