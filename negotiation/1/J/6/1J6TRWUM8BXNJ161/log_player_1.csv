"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's closer than my initial offer. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round. I still have a chance to get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160. This is still above what Bob is willing to pay, but it's closer to his offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  It also keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept this offer because:

* It's close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal by continuing to negotiate.
* I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not losing out significantly by accepting Bob's offer.
* I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm confident that I've gotten the best price I can from Bob."
