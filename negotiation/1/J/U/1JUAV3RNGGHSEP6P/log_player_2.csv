# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can save at least $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can still potentially save some money by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer.  You're already $250 below your target price of $8,500, so there's room to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $8,600 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

It's getting close to your target price. You're now only $100 above your preferred price.  The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might not budge and you'll have to pay the higher price from John. It's a good time to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
