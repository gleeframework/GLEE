"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is still a great deal for you considering your value is $8,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you're willing to come down, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $8,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $8,600 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8700.0,Alice,5,
