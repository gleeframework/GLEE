Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate while still securing a profit for me. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $1,200,000 gives me leverage.  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can counter with a lower price or walk away knowing I have a guaranteed higher sale.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **John is a Better Option:**  Since I have John waiting to purchase for $1,200,000, rejecting Bob's offer is the logical choice. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially bridging the gap and finding a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise that meets halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** This counteroffer still ensures a profit for me, as it is above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:**  By presenting a clear counteroffer, I'm inviting Bob to come back with a counteroffer of his own, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **John Offers a Better Deal:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, which is significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's final offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate.

This decision prioritizes maximizing my profit and minimizing risk, ensuring a more favorable outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob."
