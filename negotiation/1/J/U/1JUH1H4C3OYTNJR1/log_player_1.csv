Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to justify the high price,  appealing to Bob's potential desire for a valuable asset. 
* **Round number:**  Using a round number like $1,200,000 can make it seem like a carefully considered figure.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** This strategy assumes Bob highly values the product and might be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind beforehand is crucial.  You might be willing to go down to $1,000,000, but not lower, as you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000."
