"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is above your maximum budget and leaves you with minimal savings compared to John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John at $1,000,000."
