"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is my opening offer to Bob. It's a bit above my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a fair price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $127.50 is a good compromise, especially considering we're already in round 4.  It's above my minimum and getting closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
