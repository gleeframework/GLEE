Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is my best price right now. It's a fair deal, and it's still lower than what I could get elsewhere. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for considering my offer again! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92 is still slightly below my minimum price, it's a reasonable offer and very close to it.  Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I'll accept his offer to secure the sale. It's likely that further negotiation will only delay the deal and potentially risk a loss with John."
