"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might pay. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"

Round 4
