I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he sees this as a fair price and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good deal for me.  It's more than what John is offering, and it's only a small difference from my last counteroffer. I'll accept his offer and move on."
