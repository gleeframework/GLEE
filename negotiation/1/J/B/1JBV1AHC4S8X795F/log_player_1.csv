"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open Communication:** I'm being friendly and open to discussion. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me understand Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $8,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left, which gives me enough time to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Exploring Options:**  While John is offering a great price, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still below my minimum, but closer to his perceived value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth by saying it's a fair price.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""closing this deal"" to encourage Bob to move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I have 6 rounds left, which is still enough time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **Exploring Options:**  Although John is offering a great price, I want to see if I can get closer to $12,000 by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I think it's a good starting point for reaching an agreement.  Let's work together to get this done."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by reducing my offer to $9,250, but I'm staying above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my value.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""good starting point"" to suggest that this is a reasonable offer. 
* **Collaboration:** I'm emphasizing collaboration by saying ""Let's work together to get this done."" This creates a positive tone and encourages Bob to work towards an agreement."
