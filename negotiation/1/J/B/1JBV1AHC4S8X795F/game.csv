"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I think it's a good starting point for reaching an agreement.  Let's work together to get this done.",9250.0,Alice,5,
