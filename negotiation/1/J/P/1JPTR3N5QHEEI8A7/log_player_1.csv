Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's slightly above what Bob values the product, hoping to incentivize him to negotiate. I'm not aiming for the maximum possible price right away, as this could scare him off. I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a good profit.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still demonstrating the value of the product. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the deal. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $1,000,000."
