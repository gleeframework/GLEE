"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the best chance of securing a high price. If Bob rejects, I can always lower my offer in subsequent rounds.  However, I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any point if I feel the negotiation is going poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John for $12,000. I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to an agreement and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to $17,000, I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob and potentially ending up selling to John for $12,000. $16,500 is a good price and I think it's worth securing the deal."
