Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate your effort.  However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's try $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000, Bob is not budging on his price, and we're running out of time.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum threshold.  It's the most sensible choice at this point."
