Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiations with him or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a decent compromise. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
