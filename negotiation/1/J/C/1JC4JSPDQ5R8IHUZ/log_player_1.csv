Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $113. Can you try to go a bit lower? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and $113, which would be $112.50. Can you live with that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I only have a few rounds left. It's a better outcome than selling to John for $120."
