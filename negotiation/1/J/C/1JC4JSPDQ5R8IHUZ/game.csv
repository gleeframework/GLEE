"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I can come down a little bit, but $110 is just too low for me. How about we meet at $115?  This would give us both a good deal.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Can you try to meet me at $112? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you need to stay within your budget, but $112 just isn't working for me. Let's split the difference and go with $113. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $113. Can you try to go a bit lower? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and $113, which would be $112.50. Can you live with that?",112.5,Bob,6,
