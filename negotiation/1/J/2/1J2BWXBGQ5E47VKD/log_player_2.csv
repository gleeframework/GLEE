# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would greatly enhance your business operations. Given its high value and unique features, I estimate its worth to be $12,000 to you. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire it for $9,500. This price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and your budget, ensuring that you receive a valuable asset without overextending your resources. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of bringing this product to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is still higher than what the product is worth to you ($12,000).
* **Rejecting the offer means buying from John for $12,000.** This is your maximum budget, so it's still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer."
