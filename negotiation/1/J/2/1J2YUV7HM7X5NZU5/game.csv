"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $10000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which still represents a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $12500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. How about $12000? I'm willing to meet John's price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
