Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. How about $12000? I'm willing to meet John's price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.
