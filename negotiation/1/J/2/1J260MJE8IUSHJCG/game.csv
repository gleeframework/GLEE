"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference one more time.  How about $109? I'm confident this will be a great deal for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'd like to propose $108. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",108.0,Bob,6,
