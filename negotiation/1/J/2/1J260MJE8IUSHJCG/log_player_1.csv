"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.50 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference one more time.  How about $109? I'm confident this will be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'd like to propose $108. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. It's clear he's not willing to go much higher, and I'm not willing to go much lower.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, I'm going to take that offer."
