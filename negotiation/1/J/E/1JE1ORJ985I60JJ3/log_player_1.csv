"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still significantly less than the $14,000 I initially offered, and I believe there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to my original offer. How about $13,500?  It's still a great value for you, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

While $11,500 is closer to my goal than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to $13,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground here. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I can't go any lower than $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $12,000."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. The negotiations with Bob have not been fruitful, and I'm running out of time.  Even though it's not my ideal price, it's better than continuing to negotiate and risk losing the deal entirely."
