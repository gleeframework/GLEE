"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product. If not, I'll be prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $120. This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I hope Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a good price for me. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $105. This is now a significant discount from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and accept the offer. If he doesn't, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $100 might be the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I'd prefer to get more, it's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum value for the product.  I've reached the point where I'm risking losing money if I continue negotiating with Bob. Selling to John is the best way to guarantee a profit."
