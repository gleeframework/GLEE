Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm currently only able to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target,  I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and the maximum I can currently offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to our desired price point.  We're still early in the negotiation and can afford to push a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and understand your position.  Let's aim to finalize this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a very fair price for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal, as I'm confident this is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could push a bit further, Bob is clearly committed and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting $1,080,000 provides a strong profit above our minimum, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing the deal altogether."
