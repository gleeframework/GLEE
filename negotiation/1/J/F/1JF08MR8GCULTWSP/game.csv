"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $600000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $900000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm prepared to sell to another buyer who is ready to pay my asking price. ",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $900000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $700000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John for $800000.",700000.0,Bob,6,
