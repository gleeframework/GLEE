"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I propose a starting price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product and the return on investment you'll see.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I'm confident this would be a win-win for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
