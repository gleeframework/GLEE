"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, I can likely get a better price by negotiating. I'm willing to pay up to $150, so I have room to haggle.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $120. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a price I'm comfortable with, given that I'm willing to pay up to $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is only $10 more than my initial counteroffer. This is a good deal considering my maximum budget is $150. Accepting the offer saves me time and potentially avoids further negotiation rounds."
