"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $75, you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what the product is worth to me.  This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, and I'm hoping to entice Alice to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $75 to $70. This is a good price for me, as the product is worth $100 to me.  While I could continue to negotiate, accepting the offer saves time and effort.  If I keep going, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal, and I risk running out of rounds."
