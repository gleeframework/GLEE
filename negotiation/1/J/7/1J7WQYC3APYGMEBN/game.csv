"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $920,000?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $920,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I think my final offer is $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
