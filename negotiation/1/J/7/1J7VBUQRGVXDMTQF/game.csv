"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,080,000. Can we discuss further to find a mutually beneficial agreement?",1080000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're still holding firm on your valuation, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be more aggressive. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. Can we find a middle ground?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
