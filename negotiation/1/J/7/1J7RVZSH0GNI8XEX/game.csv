"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we try $109? It's a small step closer, and I think it's fair for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. Can you meet me at $107? I think that's the best we can do at this point.",107.0,Bob,6,
