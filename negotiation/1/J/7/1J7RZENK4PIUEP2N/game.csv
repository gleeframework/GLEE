"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $900000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1050000 is still a bit below what I consider to be a fair price for this product.  I'm going to counter with $1100000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement. Let's get this deal done.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
