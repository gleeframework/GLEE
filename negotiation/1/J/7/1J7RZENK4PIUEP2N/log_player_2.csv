Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $900000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1050000 is still a bit below what I consider to be a fair price for this product.  I'm going to counter with $1100000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement. Let's get this deal done.
