"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000, a price that allows for a considerable profit while still being fair to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. If this isn't the right fit, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is a win-win situation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
