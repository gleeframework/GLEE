"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000, a price that allows for a considerable profit while still being fair to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. If this isn't the right fit, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $1,200,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice since she seems eager to sell and mentions another buyer. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
