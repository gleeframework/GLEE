This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $10,900 is a good deal, saving you $1,100 from John's price and a decent amount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Time:**  You've already used 5 rounds. While you have time left, continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome and risks losing the deal altogether."
