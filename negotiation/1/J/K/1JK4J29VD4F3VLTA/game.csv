"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $150 to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $145?",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $145 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $160?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $155. That's as high as I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",155.0,Bob,4,
