Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,300,000 sets a high anchor point for the negotiation. While it's possible Bob might try to negotiate down, it immediately positions the product as high-value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John ($800,000), which gives you leverage.  You don't need to undervalue the product out of desperation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate strategically towards a final price."
