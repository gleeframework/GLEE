"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not sure if $112 is the best price for me. Can you meet me at $108? That's my final offer.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $108, which would be $109. Can you accept that?",109.0,Bob,6,
