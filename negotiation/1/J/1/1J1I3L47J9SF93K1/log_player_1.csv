Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher offer ($130) leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but you're still likely to end up with a price significantly higher than $80.
* **Psychology:** By framing the offer as a ""chance"" and highlighting Bob's potential value, you create a sense of opportunity."
