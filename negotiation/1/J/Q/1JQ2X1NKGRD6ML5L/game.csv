"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
