"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's less than the value you've placed on the product, and allows me to meet my price expectations.",10000.0,Alice,3,
