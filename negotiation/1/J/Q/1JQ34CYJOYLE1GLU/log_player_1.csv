{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, you have John as a backup option, so you don't have to settle for a price you're not happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While you don't want to lose Bob entirely, you should reject his offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's less than the value you've placed on the product, and allows me to meet my price expectations."", ""product_price"": 10000}
