Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially earn more than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $65. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $75.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can go up to $70 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum of $80. It's worth accepting this offer as it's unlikely he'll go higher and I can always sell to John for $80 if this deal falls through."
