"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is my final compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
