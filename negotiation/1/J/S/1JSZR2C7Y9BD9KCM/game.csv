,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,100,000 is tempting,  I'm still holding a bit higher on the value. Would you consider $1,225,000? This allows me to come down a bit while recognizing the significant value this product holds.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still valuing the product highly, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,187,500. This demonstrates my desire to reach a deal while acknowledging the value of this product.",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,187,500. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
