Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has John as a backup. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning listing it publicly, Alice implies that this is a limited-time offer, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
