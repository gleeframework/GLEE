"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.** This means there's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **You have no information about Alice's minimum price.**  Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed alternative.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a fallback option. 

By rejecting the offer, you can explore if there's room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,500,000 is my upper limit.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  A 20% discount is significant but not unrealistic. It shows you're serious about buying but are also trying to save.
* **Open-ended message:** This encourages a dialogue and leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your offer.
* **Maintaining your maximum budget:**  If Alice rejects, you can still go with John's offer, ensuring you don't overspend."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1350000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable:**  She moved halfway from her initial offer, which shows flexibility.
* **You're saving money:**  $1,350,000 is significantly less than your initial budget and John's price.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** It's likely that further counteroffers will lead to a stalemate or force you to buy from John. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a lower price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation delays."
