"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John. It's worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is still $5 more than what the product is worth to Alice. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and a good starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I know she's not willing to go much lower than $90. However, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $87, which is only $2 less than Alice's current offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a better price.  It's a small enough difference that Alice might be willing to accept it to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is only $9 more than what the product is worth to her.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she will reject my counteroffer again.  At this point, it's likely that $89 is the best price I'm going to get. It's still cheaper than buying from John, so it's worth accepting."
