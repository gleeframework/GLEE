"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $180. Is that something you'd be interested in?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you consider $120? It's a fair price that I'm sure we can both be happy with.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $160. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $130 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer you the product for $145. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $140 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll agree. ",140.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $142, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can agree on that, I'm happy to make the deal.",142.0,Alice,7,
