"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This would be a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a bit above my original target, but I think it's a fair price for this product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still slightly below my minimum. To make this deal work, I need to get at least $990,000.  It's a small difference, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's close this deal at $990,000.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you need to get at least $990,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair. Let's see if we can make it work.",985000.0,Bob,8,
