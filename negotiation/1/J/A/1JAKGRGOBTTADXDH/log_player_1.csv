I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I make a substantial profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I can't accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired outcome with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still leaves me with a comfortable profit.  I believe this price is fair, reflecting the product's value and leaving room for Bob to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still too low.  Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is a reasonable price considering my minimum threshold. It's time to move on and secure a guaranteed sale."
