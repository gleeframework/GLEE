{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your initial target of $800,000, it's still too high. There's room for negotiation, and you should aim to get a lower price. You have 9 more rounds, so there's no need to rush into a deal at this point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price well below Alice's offer and closer to my target. This is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and demonstrate my seriousness in acquiring the product at a reasonable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going for my target price of $800,000. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can reach a deal at this price. If Alice rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate my options and consider buying from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I have a few more rounds to negotiate and see if I can push her even lower.  John is a good fallback option, but I'm still trying to get the best possible price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a slightly higher counteroffer than my target price, but still within a range where I'm comfortable. Alice has shown some flexibility, and I believe this counteroffer will be acceptable to her. I'm aiming to strike a deal before reaching the final few rounds and potentially having to resort to buying from John."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my target price.  It's only $40,000 over what I'm willing to pay from John.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can secure the product at a reasonable price by accepting this offer."
