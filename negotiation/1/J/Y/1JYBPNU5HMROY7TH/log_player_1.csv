"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential deal without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially reach a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and although I would prefer to sell to John for $12,000, I'm running out of time. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and prevents me from losing out entirely."
