"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,300,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Let's compromise at $1,350,000. This price still gives you a significant value for the product, and it allows me to recover a fair portion of its worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
