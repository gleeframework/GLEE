"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's worth at least that much to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $14,000? That's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
