"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. I'm willing to start at $140 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget of $120.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $140 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to offer you $125 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I would like to propose $135 as the price for the product. This is my best offer, considering the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, he still wants to save more. He's willing to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $135 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm willing to offer you $130. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. Considering the value I place on the product, I believe $132 is a reasonable price. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132 is still above Bob's comfort zone. He's already made multiple counteroffers and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge further. Rather than continuing to negotiate, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $120, ensuring he gets the best possible price within his budget."
