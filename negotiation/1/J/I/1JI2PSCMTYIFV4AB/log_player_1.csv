Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about $112? That's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price, and I'm not quite ready to sell to John for $120 yet. I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $113? It's a small step closer to my price, and it might be a good compromise for us both."", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $113. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $109? That's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $109 is too low for me.  I'm getting frustrated with this negotiation and I'm worried I'm going to run out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to bargain with Bob and risking getting less."
