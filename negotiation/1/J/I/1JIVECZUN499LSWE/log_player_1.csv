"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth significantly more to me than Bob. This will give me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, but also establishes a firm baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to me. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This keeps the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my lower limit, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm countering with $1,550,000. This is a further compromise but still higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to bridge the gap.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not willing to drop below $1,500,000 just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000.  While I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob, the negotiations seem to be stalling.  John's offer is a guaranteed amount that meets my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that by continuing with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my price."
