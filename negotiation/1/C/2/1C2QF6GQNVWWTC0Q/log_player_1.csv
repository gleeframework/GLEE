Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
