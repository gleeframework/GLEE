"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I believe this product could be valuable for me, $12,000 is a bit steep.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  $10,500 is still a little high for my budget though.  Could you do $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $9,250 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
