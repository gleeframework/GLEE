"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, but I'm not willing to sell for $10000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11200? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a concession",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower",11500.0,Alice,7,
