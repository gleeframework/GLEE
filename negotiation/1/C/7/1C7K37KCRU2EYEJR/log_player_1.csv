Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for its value,"" I am creating a sense of urgency and implying the product is worth more than the asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  While the initial offer is above Bob's perceived value, it allows him space to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested. There's space to negotiate towards a more agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is significantly below the product's value. I could meet you halfway at $115. This is a fair offer considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:**  Dropping to $115 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while staying above my $120 minimum. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about selling but not desperate.
* **Justification:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price and make it clear I'm making a concession.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Proposing to ""meet halfway"" frames the counteroffer as a fair compromise, even though it's closer to my initial price than Bob's."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95. Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob increased his offer, $95 is still significantly below my $120 minimum. 
* **Slow Progress:** Bob is negotiating in small increments, suggesting it might take a long time to reach a price I find acceptable.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth the time and risk of continuing negotiations with Bob for a potentially small increase in profit."
