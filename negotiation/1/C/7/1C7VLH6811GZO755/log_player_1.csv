**Reasoning:**

Bob has been extremely firm at $10,000. It's unlikely he'll budge significantly from this price.  Continuing to negotiate risks missing out on John's guaranteed $10,000 offer. It's better to secure a sure deal at this point than risk getting stuck with no deal at the end of the 10 rounds."
