"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is still a compromise from my initial offer of $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11200.0,Alice,5,
