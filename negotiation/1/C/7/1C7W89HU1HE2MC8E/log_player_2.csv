"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have strong interest from other parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is motivated to sell:** She has other interested parties.
* **You have a backup plan:** John offers the product for $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price than it is to her minimum. By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to walk away and force her to consider a lower price. 

By rejecting, you increase the chances of Alice coming back with a better offer, closer to $1,100,000, or even lower. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer."
