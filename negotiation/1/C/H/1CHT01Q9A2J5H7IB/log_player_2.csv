Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You have a better chance of getting a lower price if you continue to negotiate. It's worth risking another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to go as high as $875,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875,000. Considering its true value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is only $85,000 over your maximum budget of $800,000. It's a relatively small difference, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product, albeit at a slightly higher price than your ideal."
