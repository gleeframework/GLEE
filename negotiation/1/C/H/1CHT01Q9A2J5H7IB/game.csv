"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product,  $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount and reflects the potential I see in it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to go as high as $875,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875,000. Considering its true value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
