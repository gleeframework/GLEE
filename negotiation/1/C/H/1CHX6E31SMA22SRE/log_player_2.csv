"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer is $900,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:** If negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed alternative, but it's not the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, showing you're serious about saving money.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's still above Alice's value of $800,000, leaving room for a compromise.
* **Avoids John's price:** This offer keeps you from having to pay John's $1,200,000, but you'll need to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Let's continue negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the waters:**  This offer is a small increase from your previous counteroffer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.
* **Signal of seriousness:**  This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate, but also that you're not going to be swayed by a slight price drop. 
* **John's price is still a factor:**  You're still trying to avoid John's price, so you need to be careful not to go too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 830000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This offer is right in the middle of Alice's last offer and your last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Close to your goal:** This price is getting very close to your ideal price. 
* **Avoids the risk of John:** You are avoiding John's price, but you need to consider if Alice will accept this final offer before you risk it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is close:** Her offer is very close to your ideal price, and only $5,000 above your last counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could counter-offer again, there's no guarantee she'll accept.  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Saving time and effort:** Accepting Alice's offer allows you to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiations. 

It's better to secure the product at a price close to your target than risk losing the deal and having to pay a significantly higher price to John."
