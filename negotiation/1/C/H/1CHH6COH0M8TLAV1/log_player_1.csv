Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could both benefit from.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he declines, you lose the opportunity for a higher profit.

**The Offer**

The key is to find a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your gain. Here's a strong option:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth to you, and I'm confident it will be a highly profitable acquisition on your end."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable:**  $1,150,000 is a high price, but you can justify it by emphasizing the product's ""unique value and potential"" and Bob's potential profit margin.
* **Leaves Money on the Table for Bob:**  This offer allows Bob to still gain $50,000, making it a win-win situation. This increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Stronger Position than Negotiation:** Starting high leaves you room to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob counters, but still allows you to secure a price well above your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  While this is a strong starting point, always be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject the initial proposal. Having a negotiation strategy in place will be beneficial."
