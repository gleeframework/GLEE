"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford $18,000 at the moment. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I still feel that $14,000 might be a bit steep. I would like to propose an offer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more within your consideration.",12000.0,Bob,4,
