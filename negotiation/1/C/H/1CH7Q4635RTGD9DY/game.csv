"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still happy to work with you, but $77 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for the product. What do you say?",82.0,Alice,5,
