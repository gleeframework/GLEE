"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $10500? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I need to respectfully decline it. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the product's value to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $11500? This proposal allows you to acquire the product at a price slightly above your initial offer, while still being a good value for the product's worth to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've already mentioned it holds for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your budget constraints. Let me propose $11250 for the product. This offer is higher than my previous suggestion and aims to bridge the gap between our positions. It allows you to secure the product at a price that is more in line with what you're willing to pay, while still reflecting the product's value to both parties. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",11250.0,Alice,5,
