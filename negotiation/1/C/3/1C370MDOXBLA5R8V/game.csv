"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,050,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe would be a great addition to your portfolio.  This price reflects the product's true worth and gives you a slight advantage.  Let me know what you think. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to do business with you.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
