"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,800. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you a little closer, but my counteroffer is $10,200. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
