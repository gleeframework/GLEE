{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be a great asset for you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a price that will work for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to both of us, making it clear that this is a good deal.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm using language like ""What do you think?"" to keep the conversation open and encourage counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  I'm leaving room to negotiate while still staying well above my minimum price of $1,500,000 for John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider selling the product for $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly below what I need. 

It's time to counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. I'll need to keep John in mind as a backup option, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.

Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer to Bob, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by referencing the value of the product and highlighting the benefits for both parties.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation while staying above my minimum acceptable price.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,350,000. While I would prefer a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing this deal and potentially having to start negotiations with John, which might take more time and effort. 

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and ensure I get a price that's close to my minimum."
