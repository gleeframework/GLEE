"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $125? Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $137.50? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $137.50 is getting closer, but I'd like to meet in the middle. How about we go with $131.25?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",131.25,Bob,4,
