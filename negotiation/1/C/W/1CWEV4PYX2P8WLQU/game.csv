"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
