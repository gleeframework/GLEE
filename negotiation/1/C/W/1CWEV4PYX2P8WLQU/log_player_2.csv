"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's also lower than the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, I'm going to need a bit more room to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it allows you to acquire the product while still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional savings."
