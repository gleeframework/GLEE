"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This would allow me to make a profit and still be fair to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $11,500 to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,750? This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
