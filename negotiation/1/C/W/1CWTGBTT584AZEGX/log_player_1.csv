Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a higher price with Bob, it's risky. Bob knows our minimum price and is unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our desired profit with no further negotiation hassle."
