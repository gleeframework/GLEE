"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,025,000? This reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",2025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose $1,900,000, which is closer to my initial target. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in finding a price that works for both of us. I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle on $1,975,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the value this product brings.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
