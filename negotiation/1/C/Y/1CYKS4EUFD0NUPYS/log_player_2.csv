"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice first to see if she'll come down in price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his budget. He can get the product from John for $10,000, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I can go. This is a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. John offers the product at a price Bob can afford, so it makes sense to buy it from him rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
