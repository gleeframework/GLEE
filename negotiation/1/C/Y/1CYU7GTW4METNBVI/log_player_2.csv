"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is significantly higher. Let's start our negotiations with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is quite high.  You have a lot of room to negotiate and can potentially get a much better price. It's worth exploring further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the desire to save money, but also acknowledges the product's value.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends with a positive tone, suggesting a desire to find a solution that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Let's try $950,000. This gives you a substantial saving and still allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still too high.  It's worth pushing for a better price. There's still a significant difference between Alice's offer and your desired price point, so continuing to negotiate is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This price allows you to make a healthy profit, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer while still trying to save money.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that is beneficial to both parties.
* **Clear Limit:**  Stating that this is the ""best I can do"" adds pressure to Alice to accept, as further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
