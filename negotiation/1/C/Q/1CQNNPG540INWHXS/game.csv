"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,800. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  I'm offering $10,150, which is a fair price considering the product's value and your desire to acquire it.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.  Let me know your decision.",10150.0,Alice,5,
