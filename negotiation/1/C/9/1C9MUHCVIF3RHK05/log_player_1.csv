Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  How about we start at $8,500?  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm going to try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,750 is a tempting offer, I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $9,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8875}
