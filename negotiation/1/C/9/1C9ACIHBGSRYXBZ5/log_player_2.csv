# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time! I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 saves you $30 compared to buying from John. 
* Although the product is worth $100 to Alice, that's her cost, not your concern. You are focused on your own value for the product ($150) and getting the best deal."
