Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite a bit higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, that price is still a bit outside my budget.  I could go up to $800,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product at $800,000.  It's unlikely he'll go any higher. While further negotiation is possible, it risks a failed deal. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it makes more financial sense to sell to John at this point."
