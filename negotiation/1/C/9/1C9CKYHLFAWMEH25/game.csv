"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite a bit higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering the unique benefits this product offers.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still too high for me.  I can go up to $700,000 if that would be agreeable to you. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, that price is still a bit outside my budget.  I could go up to $800,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
