Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, a price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this offer is strategic:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We start by aiming high, close to Bob's perceived value.  Even if he negotiates down a bit, you're still likely to get a much better price than John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer isn't ridiculously high, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his desire to purchase it. 
 
Remember, this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but always keep your bottom line ($10,000) in mind."
