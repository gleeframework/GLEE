The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it at $170.  It's much better to reject and see if I can get a lower price."

I'm willing to pay the maximum I'm comfortable with, hoping Alice will meet me halfway."

Alice is still above my maximum price point. I'll reject and try one more time to get a lower offer."

I'm going to split the difference between my offer and Alice's last offer. Hopefully, she'll accept it, but if not, I'll just buy from John."
