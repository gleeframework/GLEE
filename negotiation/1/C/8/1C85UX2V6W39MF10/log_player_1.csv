Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profits. I'm also taking into account that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $150, giving me a fallback option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and avoid having to sell to John for a lower profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I'd ideally like, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also higher than what John is offering, so it's the best outcome in this scenario."
