"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly more than what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation with Alice, so rejecting her offer and counter-offering is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Starting with a lower offer of $700,000 significantly undercuts Alice's price while still leaving room for negotiation. This aggressive opening move signals Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal, and it could lead to quicker progress in reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget and only $50,000 more than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate. Bob is committed to getting the best price possible, and rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his target price and John's offer.  By offering $800,000, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also ensuring he doesn't overpay. This counteroffer is likely to be accepted by Alice as she is also approaching her lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is only $20,000 more than John's offer. This is a small enough difference that it's likely worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick deal.  There's a high chance that continuing to negotiate would only result in further concessions from both sides, wasting valuable time and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
