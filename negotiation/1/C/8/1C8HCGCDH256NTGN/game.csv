"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. This price still reflects the product's true value and the potential benefits it offers you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $1400000 is still a significant undervaluation of this product.  To show my flexibility, I'm willing to go down to $1600000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, but it also acknowledges the potential benefits this product brings to your business.  I hope you'll reconsider.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
