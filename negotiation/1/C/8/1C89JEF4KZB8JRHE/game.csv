"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Could you consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,500 is a good offer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500 to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so how about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
