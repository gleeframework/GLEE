"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $14,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. Could you do $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Bob,4,
