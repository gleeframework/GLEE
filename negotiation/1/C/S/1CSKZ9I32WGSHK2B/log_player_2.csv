"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John."
