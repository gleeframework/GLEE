Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value. This sets the negotiation in my favor.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows for potential negotiation and a successful deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob, which might encourage him to accept. 
* **Setting the Pace:**  I'm establishing myself as the seller, making the first offer and guiding the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While closer,  $850,000 is still $150,000 below my minimum.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there is room for a better offer from Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **I don't want to sell to John just yet:**  I'm more motivated to get the highest possible price, and John represents a safety net, not my ideal outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions and potentially close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good price while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially making him more receptive.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm not giving in completely to Bob's offer, showing I'm still firm on my value for the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone, making the negotiation feel less adversarial.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll re-evaluate my strategy based on his next offer and decide whether to counter again or switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is not budging:** He's stuck on his initial offer of $850,000.  There's a clear limit to how far we can negotiate, and further rounds are unlikely to significantly improve the offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  I'm losing time in this negotiation, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth the risk of not reaching an agreement at all. 
* **John's offer is secure:** John is a reliable buyer with a guaranteed price of $1,000,000. This represents a secure outcome and minimizes the risk of not making a sale.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll go with the guaranteed deal with John. This is a good compromise between maximizing my profit and minimizing the risk of a protracted and potentially unsuccessful negotiation."
