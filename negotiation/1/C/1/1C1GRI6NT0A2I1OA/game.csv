"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider coming down to $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
