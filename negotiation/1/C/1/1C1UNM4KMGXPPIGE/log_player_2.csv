"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I make it available to others. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message uses persuasive language, the bottom line is important. $1,100,000 is significantly more than your $800,000 maximum and the price John offers.  You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
