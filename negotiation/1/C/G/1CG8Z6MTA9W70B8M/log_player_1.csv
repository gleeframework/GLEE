Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I want a high price, starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined) without going below my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John at $80, so I'm not desperate to accept any offer from Bob."
