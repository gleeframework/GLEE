"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth might be different to you. Considering its unique features and the quality it offers, I am offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This represents a considerable savings compared to its true value to me, while still providing a substantial benefit for you given its worth to you at $8,000. I believe this is an opportunity for both of us to achieve a fair transaction. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer.
