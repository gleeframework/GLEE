Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs and am confident you'd benefit greatly from it. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob's higher valuation ($1,000,000) presents an opportunity to earn significantly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a compelling discount compared to his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and proposing a price rather than demanding it. This fosters a collaborative tone for potential negotiation."
