"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had budgeted for. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $10,000?  This offer stands as my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
