"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages, and I believe its true value is higher. I could be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,650,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
