{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value but also considering that John is willing to pay $150. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly less than what John is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about $135? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  It's still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this meets within your requirements. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $130, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already negotiated and it's clear he's not willing to go higher.  At this point, it's better to sell to John for $150, ensuring I get my desired profit."
