"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay more. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer or can proceed with your backup plan to buy from John."
