"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come to terms.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This still allows for a good margin for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
