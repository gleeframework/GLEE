{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and secure a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value subtly hints at its potential worth to Bob. 
* **Ready to Negotiate:**  This offer leaves the door open for negotiation, which is essential in this type of scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Bob's interest in the product suggests there's room for a counteroffer and a possible compromise.  
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a minimum profit, but I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating flexibility and a desire for a compromise.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both parties."
