Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, incorporating negotiation tactics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. It's something I highly value, but I recognize its potential value to you could be even greater.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to engage in discussion, showing flexibility and increasing the likelihood of a deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, collaborative), you might tailor your message accordingly.
* **Time Constraints:** If you're under time pressure to sell, you might lower your initial asking price to increase the chance of a quick agreement.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob to find a mutually acceptable price. You have John as a safety net, ensuring you won't have to go below your minimum selling price."
