"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I appreciate your consideration.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your desire to work within a budget, while $750,000 is a significant undervaluation of what this product can do for your business.  To move us closer, I could come down to $900,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budgetary concerns.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $900,000 is slightly above my budget. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,4,
