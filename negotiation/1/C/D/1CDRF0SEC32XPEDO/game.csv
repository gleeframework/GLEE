"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $1,400,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it's a price I can realistically accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counteroffer $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  To move forward, I need to be closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  We're getting close, but I need to be at least $1,400,000 to make this work for me. I've already lowered my price considerably, and I'm confident this product is worth that value to you.  If we can't find common ground at $1,400,000, I may have to consider other offers. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
