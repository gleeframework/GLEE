"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to consider purchasing it for $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $13,500. This is a fair price that is within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $14,250? This is a fair price that is closer to my minimum and still a good value for you. I'm sure we can agree on this.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $13,750 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference again and try $14,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's settle this now, okay?",14000.0,Alice,7,
