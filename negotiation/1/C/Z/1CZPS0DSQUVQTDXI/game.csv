"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside my budget. How about $105?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $108 is still a bit too high for me, though.  I'm happy to pay $106,  Let's see if we can close the deal.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $106 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $109. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
