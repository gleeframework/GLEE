"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Confident Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,000,000, Alice signals that she's open to negotiation but wants to secure a price significantly above her minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to our minimum, we have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. Accepting $700,000 would be leaving money on the table. We'll counter in the next round and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000?"", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Apparent):** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between the initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, Alice creates the illusion of a significant concession.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $850,000 remains comfortably above Alice's minimum acceptable price, giving her room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and if he's willing to move closer to her desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving up slowly, which indicates potential for a higher final price. We're still in early rounds.
* **John as Backup:** Having John's offer as a safety net allows Alice to continue negotiating with Bob, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at her minimum price.
* **Strategic Counter:** Rejecting keeps the negotiation active, giving Alice an opportunity to counter with a price closer to her desired outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  Let's try to find some common ground. How about $825,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work, while still reflecting the product's true value."", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** Alice reduces her counteroffer by $25,000, indicating she's nearing her bottom line but still willing to negotiate.
* **""Common Ground"" Language:**  Phrases like ""common ground"" and ""making this deal work"" emphasize a collaborative approach, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Value Reaffirmation:**  Alice continues to subtly reinforce the product's value to prevent Bob from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll move substantially closer to $800,000.
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Further haggling may not yield significant returns. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $800,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. It's better to take the sure thing now than risk Bob walking away later."
