Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $14000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
