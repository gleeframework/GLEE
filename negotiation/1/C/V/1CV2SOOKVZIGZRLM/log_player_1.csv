Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss this price further if you'd like."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming slightly lower ($14,500) increases the chance of a quicker sale to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation, implying I'm flexible and value Bob's perspective. This could lead to him accepting the initial offer or countering with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John."
