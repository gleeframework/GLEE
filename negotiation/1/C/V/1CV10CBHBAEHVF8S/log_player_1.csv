Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I'm able to pay. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still committed to purchasing this product, but $1,200,000 is simply out of my range.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to move on.

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadfast at $800,000 and even called this his ""final offer"".  He's now given an ultimatum. It's highly unlikely he'll move significantly from this price point.  Continuing the negotiation risks losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
