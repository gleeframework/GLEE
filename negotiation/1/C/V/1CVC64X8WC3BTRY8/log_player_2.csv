Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  It's a strong opening move, and I'll see how she responds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $25,000, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but I'm also willing to walk away if we can't agree. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will see it as a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, there are still 5 rounds left. I'm confident I can push for a slightly lower price, particularly since her offer is still above my previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to stick with my previous counteroffer of $750,000.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe this is a fair price that she might be willing to accept. Since we are halfway through the rounds, I want to avoid going too low too quickly and risk losing her."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, which seems like a tactic to try and get me to accept.  However, I'm still not willing to go that high. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially with only three rounds left. It's crucial to stay firm and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was above my desired price, so I'm going to counter with my previous offer of $775,000. I'm hoping that with only two rounds left, the pressure will be on Alice to accept a deal.  If she continues to resist, I'll likely have to consider buying from John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is significantly higher than my desired price and even higher than John's offer. With only one round left, I don't have time to negotiate further.  It's better to secure the product from John at a known price of $1,000,000. While it's not the lowest price possible, it's within my budget and ensures I get the product."
