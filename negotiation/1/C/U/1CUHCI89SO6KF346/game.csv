"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while also giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",12500.0,Alice,3,
