"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $9,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little hesitant. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
