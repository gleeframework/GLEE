"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. My asking price is $11,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is above your maximum budget of $8,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. 
* You have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a lower price than Alice's offer but still offering a price that's within my budget. 
* I'm trying to establish a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* I'm expressing genuine interest in the product to encourage Alice to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.
* While it's closer to my budget, I want to try to get a lower price.
* I have several rounds left to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While $9,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* $9,000 is still within my budget, but closer to Alice's offer.
* I'm framing the offer as a compromise to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little hesitant. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.
* While we are getting closer, there is no guarantee that Alice will accept a further counteroffer, and we are already halfway through the rounds.
*  It's now more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I get the product within my budget and minimizing further negotiation risk."
