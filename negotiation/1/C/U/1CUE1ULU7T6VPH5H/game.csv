"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to maximize the value of this transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $700,000. I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
