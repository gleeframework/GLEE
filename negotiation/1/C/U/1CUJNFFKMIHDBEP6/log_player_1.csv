Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's potential for Bob to counteroffer, and for you to adjust your price if necessary.
* **It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value:**  This could incentivize him to accept.

Remember, the key is to be assertive but flexible, and always be ready to walk away to John if necessary!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired profit margin. You're aiming for at least $900,000. There's potential to negotiate further with Bob, especially since he acknowledged the product's value. Rejecting his offer will allow you to propose a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge your offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business and leaves room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** This price is a compromise, halfway between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still stand your ground.
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the product's value for Bob's business, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still space for a slight adjustment if Bob pushes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm comfortable with. I am willing to pay $875,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below your target price of at least $900,000. While it's closer to your desired outcome, there's still room to negotiate for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.  You're still better off negotiating with Bob than selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $890,000.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  I'm hopeful we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a small compromise from your previous $900,000 proposal, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit closer to your goal.
* **Finality:** The message subtly suggests that this might be your final offer, prompting Bob to consider accepting.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** It highlights the benefits for both parties, emphasizing a win-win scenario."
