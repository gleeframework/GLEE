{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit for me.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm still firm on needing to get closer to $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  This gives you a good deal, and me a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750}
