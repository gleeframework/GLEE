Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm still firm on needing to get closer to $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  This gives you a good deal, and me a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think.
