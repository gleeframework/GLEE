"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I've set the initial price at $1,400,000 considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you meeting me halfway from the previous offer.  However, $1,225,000 is still quite a way from what I had in mind. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,300,000, and we have a deal?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, and that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
