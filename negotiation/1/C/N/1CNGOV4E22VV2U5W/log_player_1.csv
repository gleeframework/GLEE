"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I've set the initial price at $1,400,000 considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $1,400,000,  I'm aiming closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will help determine my strategy for subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and I know the product is worth significantly more to him. By rejecting, I signal that I'm aware of its value and am willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage him to make a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $50,000, a significant amount, to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm still above my minimum of $1,200,000, maintaining that the product holds higher value. 
* **Middle Ground:** The offer of $1,350,000 aims for a compromise,  meeting closer to the middle of our initial positions.  This encourages Bob to consider a more reasonable counteroffer in return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Bob's use of ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic.  He's testing my resolve.
* **Marginal Increase:** While $1,225,000 is slightly above my absolute minimum, it's a small increase compared to his previous offer. 
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations for a chance at a better deal.  Bob has shown he's willing to move, and I believe there's still room for him to go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you meeting me halfway from the previous offer.  However, $1,225,000 is still quite a way from what I had in mind. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,300,000, and we have a deal?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm above $1,225,000 but coming down slightly to show I'm still negotiating in good faith.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Bob's seriousness. Is he genuinely near his limit, or is he using the ""final offer"" tactic? 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're halfway through the rounds. I need to apply a bit more pressure to avoid getting stuck in a stalemate while keeping the option of John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, and that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could push for more, the increments Bob is moving in are getting smaller.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond this point.
* **Time Value:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Continuing to haggle for a relatively small potential gain increases the risk of losing Bob altogether.
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,275,000 is a significant profit margin above my $1,200,000 minimum and a respectable outcome compared to the initial offers.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck in a stalemate or ending up with John's offer by default."
