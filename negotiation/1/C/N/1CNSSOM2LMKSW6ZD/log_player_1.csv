I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob counters, but I'm also prepared to walk away and get my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

$800,000 is too low.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want a profit significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but I don't think he's going to go much higher.  John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a good enough profit for me."
