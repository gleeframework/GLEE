"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000, and I know it holds the same worth for you.  I'm offering it to you for the price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's what I would receive from another buyer. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
