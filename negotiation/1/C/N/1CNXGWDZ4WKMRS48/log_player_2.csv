"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000, and I know it holds the same worth for you.  I'm offering it to you for the price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's what I would receive from another buyer. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating she has other buyers willing to pay her full asking price. This leaves you no room to negotiate a better deal. You can get the same product for the same price from John, so there's no disadvantage to rejecting Alice's offer."
