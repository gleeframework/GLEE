"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $130 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
