"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price given the value to me and allows for a decent profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $950000. Considering your initial offer was $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a competitive price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to pay $987500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",987500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $987500. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1015000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
