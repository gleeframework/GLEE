Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it slightly below my minimum gives the impression of a deal and might encourage Bob to accept without further haggling. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $120 might make Bob think I'm desperate to sell and he could try to lowball me further. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
