"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $80, and Alice is offering $110.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $80, so you have leverage to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

* **You have more negotiating power.** You have 7 rounds remaining, and you know you can get the product from John for $80.  There's no reason to settle for $95 when you can likely get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price, and it's the most I can afford right now. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $92. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're adamant about paying no more than $80.
* **You have reached a critical point.** You're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While there's still time to continue,  it's increasingly likely that you won't be able to get Alice to lower her price to your desired level.
