"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price constraints. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000? This still allows for a significant profit for me and would be a great investment for your company.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and a strong investment for my company.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price still represents a solid investment for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
