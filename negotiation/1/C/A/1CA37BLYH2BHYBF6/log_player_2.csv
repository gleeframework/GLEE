"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **There's a chance to get a better deal.** By rejecting the offer, I can try to lower the price further in subsequent rounds.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  I'm not desperate to buy from Alice, and I can always go with John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price.**  She's dropped from $90 to $87.50, which is within my budget. 
* **It's a good compromise.** While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer, and I might end up paying more than $87.50. 
* **There's still a decent amount of savings.**  This offer is still $2.50 lower than John's price, and it's only $7.50 above the product's value to Alice."
