Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters."
