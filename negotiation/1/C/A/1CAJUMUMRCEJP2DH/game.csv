"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product's value is not as high as you do. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  To compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects a meaningful reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is tempting, it's still a bit too far from my desired outcome. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll recognize that this is the best price I can offer while still meeting my needs.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
