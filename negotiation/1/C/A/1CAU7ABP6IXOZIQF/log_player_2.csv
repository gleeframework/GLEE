"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80. You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, so it makes sense to take it and avoid potentially wasting more rounds."
