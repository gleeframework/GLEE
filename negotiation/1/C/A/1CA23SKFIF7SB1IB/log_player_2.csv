"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price closer to Alice's value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do any better on the price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer aims to test Alice's bottom line directly. By offering $10,000, I'm aiming for the best possible outcome while signaling that I'm serious about the purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  We're still significantly above her value for the product. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $10,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer shows I'm still aiming for a price closer to Alice's value, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid stalling the negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""ready to close the deal right now,"" I'm applying a bit of pressure without being overly aggressive.

This offer gives Alice a chance to accept a price that's still profitable for her while allowing me to stay well within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to give a bit more. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tricky one. Alice is signaling this is her ""final offer"", but we still have room to negotiate and she's likely bluffing to an extent. Let's push one more time and see if we can get closer to $10,500 before considering her ""final offer"" or John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. I'm serious about buying, but $10,500 is really the most I can justify. If you're willing to meet that price, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Standing Firm:** We're sticking to our $10,500 offer to show we're serious and it's our true walking away point.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct, emphasizing that $10,500 is the deal-breaker. 
* **No Counter-proposal:**  We're not offering another price this round. This puts the ball back in Alice's court and gives her a final chance to either accept a profitable deal or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're serious about buying, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $10,750. This is my last offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably and is now only $250 above our ideal price. While we could try to push further, there's a real risk she'll walk away.  At this point, the potential savings of $250 aren't worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $15,000. This offer represents a good compromise and a substantial saving compared to John's price."
