``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($1,500,000) as possible without risking losing him entirely.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with $1200000.  I'm willing to pay $1050000. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm aiming to get the best price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1125000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1050000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob has been firm on his price and is not showing much willingness to budge. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  This is closer to my desired price and ensures I don't waste more time with Bob."
