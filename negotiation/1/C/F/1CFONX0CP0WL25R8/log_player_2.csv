"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you've been looking for and I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than what I'd get from another buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
