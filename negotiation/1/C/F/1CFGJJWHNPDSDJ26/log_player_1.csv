Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $17,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. The message also subtly implies high demand, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you remind Bob he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act. This strengthens your position without being overly aggressive.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
