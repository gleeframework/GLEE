Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $625,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We're running out of rounds and Alice seems pretty firm on staying above $650,000. Taking the $675,000 is better than risking going over budget or having to buy from John at $1,000,000."
