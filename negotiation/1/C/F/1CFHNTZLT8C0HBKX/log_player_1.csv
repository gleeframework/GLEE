Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree your product is valuable, the price point of $800,000 is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $500,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair offer.
