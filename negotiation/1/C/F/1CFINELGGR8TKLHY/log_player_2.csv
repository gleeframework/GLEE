"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up this offer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's definitely room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows you to potentially push the price down further. You're still aiming for a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1050000 is still a bit above your comfort level, but I'm not willing to go below $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is only $30,000 away from your last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  It's likely you won't be able to negotiate much further, and continuing to reject offers could lead to a stalemate.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's still significantly lower than John's offer, and within your budget."
