"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is simply too high for me. Given my budget constraints and the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This offer reflects a significant discount while still allowing you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is well below its market worth. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a more realistic compromise. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer allows me to acquire the product while ensuring you a substantial return on your investment. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
