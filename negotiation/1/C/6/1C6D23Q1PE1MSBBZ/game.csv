"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value and quality.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $8750 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and my previous offer of $8500. I'd like to propose a price of $8625. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it.",8625.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8625.

This is as close as I'm willing to get to your proposed price, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,7,
