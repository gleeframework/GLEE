"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on $900,000. However, I'm still committed to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal this round.  I'm confident we can find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $850,000. Let's settle this now. How about we split the difference and close the deal at $875,000? This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
