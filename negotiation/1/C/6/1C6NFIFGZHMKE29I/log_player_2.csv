"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still closer to Alice's perceived value than yours. There's room for negotiation.
* **There's potential for a better deal:** You have 10 rounds, and John's offer is a safety net. This means you can afford to be a bit more aggressive in your negotiations with Alice."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While $900,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still closer to her value than yours.
* **You've already established your desired price:** You've shown you're serious about $850,000. By rejecting this offer, you continue to drive the price down.
* **Time is on your side:**  You have 7 rounds remaining."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $850,000. Let's settle this now. How about we split the difference and close the deal at $875,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price:** $875,000 is only $25,000 more than your desired price of $850,000.
* **You've made significant progress:** You've brought the price down from $950,000 to $875,000 in just a few rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product and save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
