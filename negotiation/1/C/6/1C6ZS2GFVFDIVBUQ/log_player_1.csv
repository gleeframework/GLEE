Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny at my asking price of $1,500,000. "",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a 50% profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives Bob and me space to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can settle on a price that's still significantly higher than my baseline.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
