Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer aims to maximize profit while considering the risk of Bob rejecting it. Here's the reasoning:

* **$12,000 is the minimum acceptable price:** This is the price you'll get from John, so anything above that is a win.
* **$15,000 is a reasonable starting point:** It's a significant markup on the guaranteed price, but it's not so high that it's likely to be instantly rejected. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further if he is interested but not at that price. 

**Important note:** This is a strategic starting point. Depending on Bob's reaction, you might need to adjust your price in subsequent rounds."
