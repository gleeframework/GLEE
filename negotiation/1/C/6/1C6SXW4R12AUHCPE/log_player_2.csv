Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm still feeling a bit underpaid. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Alice has come down significantly, and while $725,000 is still more than I initially wanted to pay, it's a good deal and within my budget.  I'm going to accept the offer."
