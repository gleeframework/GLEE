"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose an alternative that might work for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $900,000? I believe this could be a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my current financial situation, $1,050,000 is still beyond my reach. I'd like to continue our negotiation with a proposal that aligns better with my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $950,000? This would allow us to move forward with a deal that respects the value of your product while fitting within my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to make one more concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price that respects both of our needs.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,000,000 is a significant improvement, it's still not within my budget. I would like to propose a price closer to $975,000. This would be a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. I hope this suggestion will be acceptable to you.",975000.0,Bob,6,
