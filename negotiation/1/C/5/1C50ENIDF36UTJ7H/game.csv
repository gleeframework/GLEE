"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product and am ready to close the deal, but my absolute max is $13000. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $14500 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $13500 and hope we can come to an agreement.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
