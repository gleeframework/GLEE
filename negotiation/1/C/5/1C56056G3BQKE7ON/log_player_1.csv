"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant profit for me and still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be interested, considering the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $8,500 just yet. I can still potentially get a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. It's still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I want to maximize my profit and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $8,900. This demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $8,800. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and brings me closer to my minimum.  I'm getting a decent profit and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only increase the risk of Bob walking away, or me having to settle for John's offer."
