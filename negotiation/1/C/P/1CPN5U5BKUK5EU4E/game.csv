"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $90.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to look at other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $98. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
