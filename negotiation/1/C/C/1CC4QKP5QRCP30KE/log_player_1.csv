"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and find this price reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for the minimum right away. I'm confident I can get a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for Bob, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to what I want, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I have several rounds left, and I'm not willing to give up too much just yet. There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,250.  I'm continuing to inch closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get as much as possible.  This price is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer matches my counteroffer.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can secure a higher price with John in the future, but I don't want to risk missing out on this opportunity."
