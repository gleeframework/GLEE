Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm also confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, which will be my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price.  While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and while I could continue negotiating, I'm starting to feel like the risk of not reaching an agreement outweighs the potential for a higher price. Selling to John at $800,000 is a safe and reliable option, ensuring I get at least my minimum value for the product."
