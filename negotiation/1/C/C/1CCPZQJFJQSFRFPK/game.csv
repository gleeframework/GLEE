"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going below $12,500. Let's meet in the middle - what do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $11,000 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my bottom line.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
