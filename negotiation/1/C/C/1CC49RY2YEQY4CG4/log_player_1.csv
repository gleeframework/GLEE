"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial asking price. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids risking a deal with John."
