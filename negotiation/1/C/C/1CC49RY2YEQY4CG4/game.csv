"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is still a significant discount from my initial asking price. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
