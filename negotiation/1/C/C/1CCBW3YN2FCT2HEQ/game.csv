"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I've already told you that I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
