Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but not so high that it scares Bob off immediately. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $80 is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to negotiate with him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $110. This is a small concession to Bob, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince him to accept. If he still rejects, I'll sell the product to John for $150 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions and it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a fair price."
