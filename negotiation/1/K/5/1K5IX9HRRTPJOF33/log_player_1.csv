Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm interested in acquiring it, but I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This price allows for a good profit margin for you while still being a reasonable purchase for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
