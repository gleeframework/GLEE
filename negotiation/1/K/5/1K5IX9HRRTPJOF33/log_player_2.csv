Round 2

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to emphasize that this is as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but  $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000?
