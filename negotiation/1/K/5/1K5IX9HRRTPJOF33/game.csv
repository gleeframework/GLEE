"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm interested in acquiring it, but I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This price allows for a good profit margin for you while still being a reasonable purchase for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to emphasize that this is as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but  $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This would allow for a reasonable profit for you and a good deal for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise a little.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price is still reasonable and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
