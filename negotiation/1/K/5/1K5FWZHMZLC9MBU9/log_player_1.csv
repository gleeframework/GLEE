Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,400,000, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,250,000. How about $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob has met us back at our Round 2 offer.  While we could potentially push for more, it's unlikely Bob will go significantly higher. Accepting the $1,200,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
