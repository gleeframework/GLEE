Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  I want to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this will be enough to entice Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is offering my minimum price, and I can secure the sale without any further effort."
