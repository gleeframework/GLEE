"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambition:** Starting with a high offer aims to anchor the negotiation in our favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a higher perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value, providing a rationale for the high price. 
* **Open Communication:**  We want to establish a collaborative tone by asking for Bob's thoughts. This encourages him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  While we haven't explicitly mentioned John, the knowledge that we have another buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net and influences our negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, we're still significantly above our minimum. It's too early to accept.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting this offer, we can gauge Bob's flexibility and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John as Leverage:**  The guaranteed offer from John provides us with a strong fallback position, allowing us to confidently negotiate for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,500,000. This reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We've made a significant concession from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  However, we're still holding firm above the halfway point between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, preserving the perceived value of the product. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** The message emphasizes fairness and finding a mutually beneficial solution, reinforcing a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,500,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,300,000 represents a $300,000 profit margin, a significant return.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 aligns with the principle of compromise, suggesting a fair deal has been reached.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate introduces the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
