"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  While $700000 is below my initial expectation, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
