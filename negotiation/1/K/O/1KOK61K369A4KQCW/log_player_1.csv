Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum threshold of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him some room to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than what you're aiming for. There's room to negotiate further, and rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and hopefully secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
