"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in your product, $9,000 is a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen.",8250.0,Bob,4,
