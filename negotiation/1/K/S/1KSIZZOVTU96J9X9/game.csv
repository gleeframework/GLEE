,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway, but not all the way to $900000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000. Can you consider selling the product to me for $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1000000. Can you consider selling the product to me for $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already compromised a lot. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1030000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1030000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you've compromised a lot, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you halfway between $1030000 and $1000000, but I'll also throw in an additional $5000 to sweeten the deal. Can you consider selling the product to me for $1007500?",1007500.0,Bob,10,
