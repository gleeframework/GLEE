{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is far too high. It is better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer to Bob's maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
