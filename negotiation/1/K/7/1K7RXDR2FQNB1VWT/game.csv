"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for such a valuable product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $112.50 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for the value this product offers, and it's a good compromise.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $115. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand it's your final price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $115, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $117.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident you won't regret owning this product.",117.5,Alice,7,
