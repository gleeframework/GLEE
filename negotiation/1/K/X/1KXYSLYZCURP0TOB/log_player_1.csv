Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $100 might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of and could lead to immediate rejection. 

This strategy balances getting a good deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
