You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John for $1,500,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to come down."
