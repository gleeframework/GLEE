"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $12,000? This would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering $10,000. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
