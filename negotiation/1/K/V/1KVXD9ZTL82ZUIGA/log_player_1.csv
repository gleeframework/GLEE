"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above what I'd be willing to accept, but still within the realm of possibility considering the product's value to me ($150) and the potential room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, indicating flexibility and potentially encouraging Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Leave Room for Counter Offers:** The initial offer leaves enough room for potential counter offers within the 10 rounds, while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $175 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $100 at the moment.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, the fact he's willing to negotiate indicates there's potential to find a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. 
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer Strategy:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  The message emphasizes a collaborative approach, suggesting a fair solution for both parties. 
* **Maintaining Margin:**  The offer of $125 still allows me to make a profit that's above my minimum acceptable price, while remaining competitive with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit high for me though.  How about we meet in the middle again and do $110? I really do want to buy the product from you, but I can't go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting would be a financial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's persistence and willingness to compromise suggests further negotiation is possible.
* **Risk and potential reward:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I believe continuing negotiations might lead to a better outcome, potentially closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $115.  That's just a small step up from your offer, but it brings us closer to a deal.  I really want to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a slight concession, moving just $5 closer to Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profit.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  The message reiterates the desire for a win-win scenario, encouraging Bob to see the value in the deal.
* **Keeping the Door Open:**  The offer of $115 leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while still remaining within my acceptable range."
