"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $175 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $100 at the moment.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This gives us both a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit high for me though.  How about we meet in the middle again and do $110? I really do want to buy the product from you, but I can't go any higher.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $115.  That's just a small step up from your offer, but it brings us closer to a deal.  I really want to make this work for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
