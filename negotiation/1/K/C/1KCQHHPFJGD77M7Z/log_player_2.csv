"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's desired budget. There are more rounds of negotiation, and Bob can always go with John's offer if things don't work out. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $850,000 puts the negotiation closer to his ideal outcome. This offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget. Even though it is a lower price than her initial offer, Bob has 7 rounds left and can potentially negotiate an even lower price. He can always go with John's offer for $800,000, making it more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, trying to find a middle ground.  $900,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, while still being a reasonable amount for Bob, leaving room for further negotiation. It also avoids appearing too aggressive, which could lead to Alice ending the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer. With 5 rounds left, Bob has the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. He can always fall back on John's offer, making it a calculated risk to reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer incrementally, but also wants to keep it below $1 million. $950,000 is a reasonable middle ground that allows for further negotiation. With four rounds left, there's still time to get to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his budget. With three rounds left, there's still potential to secure a better deal. Bob can always go with John's offer, so he's willing to risk rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push, hoping to get close to his budget with only two rounds left.  $975,000 is a reasonable compromise, representing a significant discount from Alice's current offer.  At this point, Bob is likely prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't come closer to this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting and getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. With only one round remaining, it's highly unlikely that Alice will further reduce the price to meet Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $800,000, guaranteeing him the best possible price and avoiding the risk of further negotiation failure."
