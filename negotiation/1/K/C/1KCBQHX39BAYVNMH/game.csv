"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to your company. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
