Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough one. Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000 and moving up slowly. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** $1,225,000 is a loss compared to John, but better than we might get later from Bob.
* **Rejecting:** Risks pushing Bob away, we might not get a better offer. 
* **John:** Our guaranteed fallback, but we lose potential profit.

Since we're still above John's offer, let's try one more counter:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has hit his maximum price and is unlikely to budge. Continuing negotiations at this point risks losing both Bob and John's offers.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, avoiding further negotiation risk."
