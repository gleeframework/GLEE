Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $14,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the ""value"" can make Bob feel like he's getting something exclusive. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By using phrases like ""suggesting"" and ""what do you think"", you invite Bob to counter-offer rather than just flatly refusing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower. 
* **Market Demand:** If the product is in high demand and you have other potential buyers, you can afford to be more firm on price."
