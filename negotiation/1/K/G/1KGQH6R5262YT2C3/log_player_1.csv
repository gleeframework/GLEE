Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,190,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. 
    * It's a significant saving for Bob compared to your alternative buyer.
    * It's close enough to your minimum price that it represents a substantial profit even if Bob negotiates a bit lower. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $1,000,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a premium if he recognizes the product's scarcity or unique benefits. 
* **Negotiation:**  This offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can decide if you're willing to go lower, knowing John's offer is your safety net."
