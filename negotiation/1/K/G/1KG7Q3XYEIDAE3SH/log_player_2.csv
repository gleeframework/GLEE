"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and there's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $9,000. This is still a good deal for me as it's well below my maximum budget, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm not willing to give up too much of my potential savings. I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good price. This is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating.  Even if the deal falls through, I can still buy the product from John for $15,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still not willing to pay her asking price. With only a few rounds left, I need to start closing the gap, but I'm not going to give up too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, but still leaves me with a decent amount of savings compared to Alice's latest offer.  I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, but I want to see if I can get Alice to meet me halfway. With only a few rounds left, I need to make a serious effort to close the deal, but I'm not giving up on getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly close to my maximum budget of $15,000.  With only one round left, I'm unlikely to get a significantly better price.  It's better to take the guaranteed price from John. 

While I'd prefer to save some money, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and being left with no product is too high at this point.  John offers a safe and reliable option, and it's more important to secure the product than to try for a few more dollars of savings."
