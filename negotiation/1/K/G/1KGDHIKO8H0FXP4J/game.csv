"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still out of my budget. I'm confident that $750,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
