"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $675,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to pay $660,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",660000.0,Bob,4,
