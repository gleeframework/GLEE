"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This is my best offer considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500.  This is a fair price given my value for the product and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer. However,  $8500 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9500 is closer to my budget, but it's still a stretch.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  This is a fair price, and it would allow us both to close the deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9000.  While I'm willing to keep negotiating, $9000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? That would be a fair compromise, and we could both walk away happy.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. To close this deal, I'm willing to go to $8750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction today.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you pushing for a deal.  $8750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we settle on $9000? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal right now. This is my last offer, so let me know if we can finalize this.",9000.0,Alice,9,
