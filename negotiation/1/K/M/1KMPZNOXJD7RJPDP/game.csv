"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,500? This would still represent a good value for you, and allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
