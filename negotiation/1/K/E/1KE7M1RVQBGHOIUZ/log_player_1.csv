Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth is $800,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. We know John will buy it for $800,000 so we shouldn't accept anything less. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I believe the value of this product is considerably higher than your proposal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're still holding out for a better price from Bob. While his offer is getting closer to our minimum, we're not there yet. We'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some progress in our negotiations.  To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to accept $875,000 for the product. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation or taking John's offer, as we've achieved the best possible outcome."
