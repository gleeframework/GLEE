"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to part with it for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $815,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's close, Bob has already made his final offer and there is a risk that Alice will continue to hold out for a higher price.  It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed price from John."
