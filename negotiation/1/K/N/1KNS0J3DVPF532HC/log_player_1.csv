Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Starting too high (e.g., $14,500) might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit with increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
