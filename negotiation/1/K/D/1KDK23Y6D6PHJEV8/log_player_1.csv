Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,999. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($12,000) as possible.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice leverage. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Slight Discount:**  Offering the product just below $12,000 might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while having the safety net of John's offer."
