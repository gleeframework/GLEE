Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer is higher than your minimum value of $100.  It allows for some negotiation space while still starting with a strong asking price. I've included a friendly message to make the offer seem more personal and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, but I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is tempting, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to my original offer. How about $135? I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value of $100, and it's not much different from my last counteroffer.  Accepting his offer will save time and effort compared to further negotiation."
