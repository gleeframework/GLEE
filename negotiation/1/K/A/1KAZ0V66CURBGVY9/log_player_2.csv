"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for you, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000. This is a better price than John's offer of $12,000 and is within Bob's budget of $12,000. It's a good deal for Bob, and it's likely Alice won't go any lower.  Therefore, Bob should accept the offer."
