"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always wise to start by rejecting the initial offer. This gives you a chance to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  Since you're willing to pay up to $150, there's no reason to accept the first offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price will test her willingness to negotiate. $120 is a good starting point, leaving room for potential compromise. This also shows that you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $135. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. Since I only have 10 rounds and there's a chance we won't reach an agreement, it's best to accept this offer rather than risk losing the product to another seller or running out of time."
