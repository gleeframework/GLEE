"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,700. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
