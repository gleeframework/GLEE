"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

It's a good start, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and I might be able to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $10,800 is getting closer to a price I'm happy with. I think I can push for a slightly better deal still."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,700. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700

This seems like a reasonable final offer from Alice. It's a good price and significantly less than buying from John. It's time to accept and close the deal."
