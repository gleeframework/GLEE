Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to consider a reasonable counter-offer if you have one."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,999 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate and potentially feel like he's getting a deal.  
* **High Anchor Price:** This price point sets a high anchor, making Bob more likely to perceive any counter-offer as a bargain.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning a ""special price,"" we subtly hint that there might be other interested parties (John), creating a sense of urgency. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, it's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit. We are securing John as a backup to ensure we get the product's minimum value."
