"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $150 to her, and she's offering it for $180, which is too expensive for me. I can buy the product from John for $120, which is a much better deal.
