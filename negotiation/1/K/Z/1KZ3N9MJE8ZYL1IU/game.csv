"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $650,000? That feels like a fair starting point for negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $650,000 is lower than my initial offer. However, it's significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $725,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant compromise on my part. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
