"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? That way we both get a fair price.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
