I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a considerable profit for me. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob, while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get more, $1,600,000 is a good profit and it seems unlikely Bob will budge further. It's also a significant improvement over selling to John."
