{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my usual asking price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but not so high that he'll immediately reject.
* **It's below your value:** You're still making a significant profit, and there's room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob knows exactly what you're offering and what's expected of him. 

You can always adjust the price based on Bob's response, but this is a solid first step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my maximum budget for this purchase. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply not enough. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my original offer of $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price still gives you a good deal while ensuring I'm able to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. How about we meet at $980,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and it's still a significant discount from your original price of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, and I'm willing to go through another round of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $980,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $1,020,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us are happy with the deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we meet at $1,009,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,009,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,009,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price.  I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John and secure the guaranteed profit."
