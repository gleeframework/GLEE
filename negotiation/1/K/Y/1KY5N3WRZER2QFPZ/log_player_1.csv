Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice, along with the offer:

**Strategy:**

Alice has a strong fallback option with John, guaranteeing her the product's full value.  She should leverage this to aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value. However, being too aggressive could lead Bob to reject the offer.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I take it to other interested parties. Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and opportunity can nudge Bob towards a decision.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" subtly reinforces that the price is justified.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, maximizing Alice's potential profit.
    * It leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for Alice. 
    * If Bob declines, Alice doesn't lose much, as she has John as a secure buyer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Alice could adjust her message and price based on her assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
