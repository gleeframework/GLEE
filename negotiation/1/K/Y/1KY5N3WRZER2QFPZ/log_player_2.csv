"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I take it to other interested parties. Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
