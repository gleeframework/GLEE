"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value both of us are seeking. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is still quite significant. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,000,000 remains a significant stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000,  which represents a compromise on both our ends. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still constrained by my budget and can't go higher than $930,000. If you're willing to accept this offer, we can finalize the deal. If not, I will have to explore other options.",930000.0,Bob,8,
