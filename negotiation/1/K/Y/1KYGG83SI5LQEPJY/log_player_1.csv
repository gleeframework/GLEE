Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value both of us are seeking. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still constrained by my budget and can't go higher than $930,000. If you're willing to accept this offer, we can finalize the deal. If not, I will have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  While $930,000 is a good price, accepting a sure $1,200,000 from John is the best business decision in this scenario.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a lower final price or even losing him as a buyer without securing a deal."
