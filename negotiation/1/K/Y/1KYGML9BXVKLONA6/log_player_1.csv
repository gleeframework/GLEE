Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my bottom line.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, suggesting that I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **I have a guaranteed alternative:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, giving me leverage in this negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore further possibilities and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my desired range:**  I'm aiming for a price as close as possible to my desired $1,200,000 without being too far from Bob's perceived value. 
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I'm portraying my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it seem like I'm being flexible and willing to meet halfway. 
* **Finality:**  I'm stating that this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

This approach aims to push the price higher while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $900,000. If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).**  While $900,000 is closer, it's not a deal that I'm comfortable with.
* **Negotiations seem to be stalling:**  Bob has clearly set a hard limit, and further negotiation may not yield a significant improvement.
* **I have a guaranteed alternative:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 gives me a guaranteed profit and a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

Given these factors, it's more beneficial to sell to John and secure a higher price.  The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is not worth the potential loss in profit."
