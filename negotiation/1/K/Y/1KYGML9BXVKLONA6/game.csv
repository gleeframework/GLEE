"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $900,000. If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do.",900000.0,Bob,4,
