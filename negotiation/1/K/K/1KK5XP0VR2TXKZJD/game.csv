"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'll consider $887,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. Let's see if we can shake on it.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $887,500 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $862,500, which is exactly halfway between our last two offers.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",862500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $862,500 is a good price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'll consider $887,500, but I'll give you a slight discount to $882,500. Let's see if we can make a deal.",882500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $882,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I will have to look at other options.",850000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a compromise, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",860000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $860,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $840,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",840000.0,Bob,10,
