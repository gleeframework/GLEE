{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and deal for Bob to make him more likely to accept. 
* **Flexibility:**  This allows for potential counteroffers while still giving me a good starting point.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he acknowledged the product's value. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is a backup:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a higher price, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't accept $8,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is my lowest price.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a drastic loss.
* **Compromise:**  I'm dropping my price slightly from $9,500 to $9,000, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the deal Bob is getting by emphasizing it's still a ""great deal."" 
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm remaining open to further negotiation but also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am still unable to meet at $9,000, but I am willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Lower Offers:** There's a risk that if I accept Bob's offer, he might continue to try and negotiate lower in the future.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so I don't need to settle for a lower price. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly higher price, aiming to get closer to my desired value while still showing flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,750. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is a ""fair compromise"" and implying that this is likely my final offer. This puts pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Keeping Options Open:** While this offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm confident in John's offer and can afford to be slightly more firm in my negotiation."
