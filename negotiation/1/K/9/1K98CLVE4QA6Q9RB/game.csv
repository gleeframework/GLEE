"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $90. If you're willing to come down to that, I'll take it. ",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $95. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
