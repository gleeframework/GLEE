Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **""Great deal"" and ""confident you'll find it valuable"":**  These phrases are used to subtly build confidence in Bob that the product is worth the price.
* **""Let me know what you think"":** This encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer sets the stage for a negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000. By starting high, I give myself the best possible outcome, but I'm also prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting this would mean a loss for me.
* **Proceed to the next round:** I am confident that I can secure a better price, especially given that I can always sell to John for $10,000. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to hold firm on my price. This sets the stage for a counteroffer, where I can try to secure a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also keeping John as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the quality and value you'll be getting.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **""Too low for me"":** This reinforces my stance that I am unwilling to accept a price lower than my minimum.
* **""Considering the value of this product"":** I subtly remind Bob of the product's worth,  implying he should be willing to pay more.
* **""Willing to come down to $10,500"":** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **""Fair price"":** This subtly positions my offer as the most reasonable and balanced solution.
* **""What do you say?"":**  This encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer balances firmness with a willingness to compromise.  I've reduced my price slightly, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement. However, I've also made it clear that I'm not willing to drop below $10,000. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If not, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
