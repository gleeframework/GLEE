Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested since the product is worth $800,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to get a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm offering $850,000. It's a compromise, but it's still above my minimum value and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer to get a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

I've gone through a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, but we haven't been able to agree on a price. His offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to make a profit, it's important to secure a sale. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which meets my minimum requirement.  I'll sell to John."
