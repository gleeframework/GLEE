Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will be interested in this price as it's below his value of $10,000.  

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be able to gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. If he counteroffers too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and leaves me with a loss.  While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation. 

I'll send a counteroffer closer to my initial price to see if Bob is willing to compromise.  If he's not, I'll always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $14,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $11,000. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum value. 

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair middle ground and accept, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if necessary. If he rejects this offer, I'll reassess and consider either making another counteroffer or selling to John."
