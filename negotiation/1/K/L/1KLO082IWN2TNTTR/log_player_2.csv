"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He knows he can buy the product for $10,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his own maximum value of $10,000.  By offering $11,000, he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying, but also that he's willing to walk away if she doesn't come closer to his price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is significantly better than Bob's own maximum value of $10,000. Although Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the opportunity cost of potentially losing the product to another buyer makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
