"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a stalemate.  $1250000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000, which is a significant concession on my part. This offer is valid for a limited time.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
