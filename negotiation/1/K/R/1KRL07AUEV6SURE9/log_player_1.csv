Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is truly worth. Let's meet halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate and secure a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a stalemate.  $1,250,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This offer is valid for a limited time.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider to be a fair price for the product.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round. There's still a chance we can reach an agreement, but I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John if our negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and we need to find a solution. I'm committed to finding a mutually agreeable price, but I can't go any lower than $1,275,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to achieve your desired savings. Please consider this final offer before we have to move on."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  We've reached a point where there is unlikely to be further negotiation.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John.  Although it's not the ideal price, it's better than risking further rounds and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob or ending up with no deal."
