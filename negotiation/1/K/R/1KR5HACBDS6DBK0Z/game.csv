"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think!",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $85 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,
