"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to get as much as possible. Starting near Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price high.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:** The offer to John for $800,000 is our safety net. We won't settle for anything less.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is positive and invites Bob to counter, signaling we're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still significantly less than our target and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counter-offer indicates a willingness to negotiate. We have leverage as he values the product.
* **John as a backstop:** We're not desperate yet. We can afford to continue negotiating since we have the option of selling to John for $800,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,050,000, we're meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($900,000) and our previous asking price ($1,100,000). This shows flexibility but maintains a strong position.
* **Emphasizing Value:** We reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Maintaining a Firm Tone:** While flexible, we don't want to appear desperate. The language remains firm and emphasizes that we're looking for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is moving in the right direction, increasing his offer. This indicates he's willing to negotiate, and we likely have more room.
* **Still Below Target:** $950,000 is better, but it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value and our desired outcome.
* **Time for Strategic Concessions:** We need to show some flexibility to keep Bob engaged, but we'll make smaller concessions in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We reduce our price by $25,000, showing movement but not giving away too much at once. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. He might be more likely to accept a price now, rather than risk losing the deal.
* **Still Above Reserve:** Importantly, we remain well above our guaranteed sale price to John ($800,000), protecting our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the ""Final Offer"":** Bob didn't budge much after our ""final offer"" tactic. This suggests he might be more flexible than he's letting on.
* **Time is on Our Side:** We still have a few rounds left, and John's offer provides a safety net. There's no need to panic.
* **Aiming for a Smaller Concession:** We want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to our price. By rejecting this offer, we signal we're serious about a higher figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's make this a deal at $975,000. "",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're splitting the difference again, moving down to $975,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate but keeps the pressure on Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message emphasizes that we're close to a deal, subtly reminding Bob of the potential loss if negotiations fail.
* **Above Reserve, Below Target:** This offer represents a potential win-win. It's above our guaranteed sale price to John but below our initial target, reflecting a realistic compromise in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still thinking $900,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob has reverted back to his offer from Round 2 ($900,000), indicating he might not be willing to move significantly from this price point.
* **Limited Upside:**  With only a couple of rounds left, the potential to negotiate a significantly better deal with Bob seems unlikely. 
* **Guaranteed Return:** John's offer of $800,000 ensures a substantial profit and eliminates the risk of walking away with nothing if negotiations with Bob completely break down.

**It's better to secure a guaranteed good deal than risk losing it all by chasing a slightly better outcome.**"
