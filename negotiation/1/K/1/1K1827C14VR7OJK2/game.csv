"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and market demand.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $850,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and market demand.",925000.0,Alice,5,
