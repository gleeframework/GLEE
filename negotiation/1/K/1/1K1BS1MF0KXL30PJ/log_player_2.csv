"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way above your budget. It's important to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to lower the price significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 5000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $5,000 is a significant difference from Alice's initial offer, it's a strong starting point for negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives ample room for Alice to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Signaling Seriousness:** By offering a concrete number, you show Alice that you're a serious buyer, but also that you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I believe that's a fair price for this quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your budget, $7,500 is still more than you need to spend.  You're getting close enough that another counteroffer is worthwhile before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,000. Would you consider $6,200? I'm very interested in the product, and that's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 6200}

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progression:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to move up, but in smaller increments, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Specific Number:** The specific amount of $6,200 makes it seem like a well-considered offer and not just an arbitrary number.
* **Urgency:**  By expressing your strong interest in the product, you create a sense that you want to close the deal soon. This might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I can see you're serious about the product. How about we split the difference and call it $6,850? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her ""final offer."" It's designed to put pressure on you, but doesn't mean she won't negotiate further.
* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While $6,850 is getting closer, it's still above your ideal price and John's price. You have room to push a little further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might stick to her ""final offer,"" but the potential savings are worth one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet that number. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $6,500. That's a fair deal for both of us, and it lets me walk away with the product I want."", ""product_price"": 6500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the ""Final Offer"":**  By acknowledging her previous statement, you show you're taking her seriously but still want to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:** $6,500 is a strong counter. It's a significant jump from your last offer, signaling you're willing to compromise, but it also keeps you well below John's price. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the mutual benefit (you get the product, Alice gets a sale) reinforces your position."
