"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I believe that's a fair price for this quality product.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,000. Would you consider $6,200? I'm very interested in the product, and that's a price I'm comfortable with.",6200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I can see you're serious about the product. How about we split the difference and call it $6,850? This would be my final offer.",6850.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet that number. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $6,500. That's a fair deal for both of us, and it lets me walk away with the product I want.",6500.0,Bob,6,
