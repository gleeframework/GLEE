"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1100000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1000000. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1075000, but I have to say that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
