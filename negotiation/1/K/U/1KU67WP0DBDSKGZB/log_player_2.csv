# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, reducing Alice's initial price by 20%. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also emphasizes that I'm not afraid to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that benefits me. I'm also highlighting the time spent negotiating, hoping it will encourage Alice to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1075000, but I have to say that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $25,000 away from my ideal price of $1,050,000. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk she might walk away, or I might not get a better offer in the next round. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that's well within my budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
