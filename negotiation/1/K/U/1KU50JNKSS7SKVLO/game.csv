"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking that $800000 is actually the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'd like to aim a bit higher. Let's try $825000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and shows my willingness to compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $810000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  It demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $810000. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about we aim for $817500? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",817500.0,Alice,7,
