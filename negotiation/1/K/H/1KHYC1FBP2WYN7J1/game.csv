"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, appreciate the offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $125? That gives us both some wiggle room.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,4,
