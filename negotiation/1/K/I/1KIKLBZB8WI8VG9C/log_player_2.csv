"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $155. It's worth at least $150 to me, so it's a fair price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum price and you know John will sell it for less.  It makes more sense to buy from John at this time."
