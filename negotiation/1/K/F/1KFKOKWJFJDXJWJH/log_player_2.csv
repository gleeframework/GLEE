"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $8,000, so I'm looking for a quick decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic called a pressure tactic.  She's trying to make you feel rushed and worried about losing the deal. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so Alice's offer isn't appealing.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price."
