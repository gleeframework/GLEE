"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to go a bit lower than my minimum. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to our target, we still have room to negotiate. We're better off countering with a price closer to $8,000 and seeing if she'll budge further. We can always buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to offer $7,000. That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about $7,500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, but slowly. We're only $500 away from John's price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $7,000 before accepting defeat and going with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,250. That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and it shows how serious I am about buying this product from you."",
