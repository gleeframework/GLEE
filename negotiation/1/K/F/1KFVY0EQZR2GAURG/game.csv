"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the item.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my minimum target profit. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the item.",9000.0,Bob,4,
