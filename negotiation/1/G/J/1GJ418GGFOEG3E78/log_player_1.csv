Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a price that Bob might be willing to consider, since it's still below the value he places on the product.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible, while also leaving room for potential counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,300,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good faith effort and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to my minimum and I don't want to risk going any lower. John is offering a guaranteed price that exceeds my minimum, so I'm going to sell to John."
