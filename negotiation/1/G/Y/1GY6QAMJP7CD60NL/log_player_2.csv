"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for a special price of $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. By rejecting this offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save a considerable amount of money."
