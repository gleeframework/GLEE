"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation room:** I still have 9 rounds left, which allows for more negotiation to hopefully reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** I can always sell to John for $150, so there's no immediate need to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $160.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain value:** $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive language:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $140 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to try and get a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $150, giving me a better deal than Bob's current offer.

I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground, but I'm not desperate to sell at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $145.  I'm confident you'll find this product really valuable, and I think this price is fair for both of us. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm dropping my price a bit further, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to close the deal.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $145, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited rounds left:** With only 4 rounds remaining, there's not much time to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is a better deal:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might lead to a lower price. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with him. John's offer is a sure thing, so it's the best course of action."
