"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to its value to me. I'd like to offer you $900,000. This allows for a significant profit for you while still leaving room for me to make a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I value our potential partnership, I need to remain closer to my initial price point. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves substantial room for you to realize the value of this product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not quite there yet. I'd like to counter with $925,000. This represents a good middle ground that allows both of us to walk away with a satisfactory outcome. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
