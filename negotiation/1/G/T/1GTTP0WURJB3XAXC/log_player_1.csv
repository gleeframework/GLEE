Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so $1,200,000 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** You need at least $1,500,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but you're also not giving away the farm.

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation without risking too much, while also keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimate, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Selling to John would guarantee you a much better profit. However, it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price by counter-offering Bob.  You have a good chance of improving on Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to work with you, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  You're not completely rejecting Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:** $1,050,000 is a substantial increase from Bob's offer but still within your desired profit range. 
* **Positive tone:** Emphasize your willingness to work with Bob and reach an agreement.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving you a chance to close the deal at a price closer to your goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

It's worth seeing if you can push Bob further by making one more counteroffer, but if he rejects it, you should move forward with selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 to finalize this deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable going above $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,000,000. How about $987,500?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  This is your last chance to make a counteroffer, and even if you do, there's no guarantee Bob will accept.  Selling to John guarantees you a much higher profit and minimizes the risk of continued negotiation with Bob. It's time to secure the best possible outcome."
