Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that $950,000 is his final offer. While this is a substantial sum, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.  

Continuing negotiations with Bob carries a risk. He might not budge from his final offer, and Alice would be left with a less profitable deal or risk losing both buyers. 

It makes the most financial sense to accept the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John at this point."
