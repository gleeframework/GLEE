{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $400,000 is a great price, but I want to see if I can get it even lower.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price.  I'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from her initial price, and $350,000 is a good deal.  I don't want to risk her getting firmer on her price or running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
