"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'll keep in mind the $800,000 safety net with John, but I want to see if I can do better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be seen as a reasonable compromise and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $920,000 is a good deal and it's only $20,000 less than my last counteroffer.  It's also above my minimum price of $800,000. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal completely."
