"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with an ambitious offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Information Gathering:** This first round is as much about understanding Bob's willingness to pay as it is about making a sale immediately. His response will give us valuable information for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, your price is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While he's signaled some willingness to negotiate, we have plenty of rounds left to try and bridge the gap. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is our safety net, but we can push for a better outcome with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While this product represents significant value, I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price ($150,000 decrease) to show Bob we're flexible and open to a deal.
* **Holding Firm:**  However, we're still holding firm above both Bob's offer and our absolute minimum.  The goal is to move towards a price that works for both of us.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake while justifying our counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a deal if we work together. I'm offering $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, but we're not there yet. We're still willing to negotiate, but we need to show him we're serious about the $1,000,000 mark. We have time to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down further to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and it reflects my desire to see you benefit from it."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  We're moving closer to our minimum acceptable price but making it clear that this is our final offer.  This creates a sense of urgency and shows Bob we're serious about the value. 
* **Slight Concession:** We're conceding another $100,000, which is still a meaningful amount but keeps us above our absolute bottom line. 
* **Focus on Value and Benefits:**  The message reiterates the value proposition and highlights how this deal would be beneficial for Bob.  We're aiming to end the negotiation on a positive note, even if he ultimately rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're committed to this price, but it's still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm going to offer $975,000. I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet our $1,000,000 minimum. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but the progress is too slow. We've shown flexibility and given him a fair chance.  At this point, continuing the negotiation risks a worse outcome. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk."
