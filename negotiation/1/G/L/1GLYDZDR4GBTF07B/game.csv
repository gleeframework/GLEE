"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
