Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob will reject the offer. A good strategy is to start closer to Bob's perceived value.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,400,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of what he stands to gain.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. The key is finding a price point that is mutually beneficial but still heavily favors you as the seller."
