"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply not a viable price for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $95?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be able to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try $85. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
