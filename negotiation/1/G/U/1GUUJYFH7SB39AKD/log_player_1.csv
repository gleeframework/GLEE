"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I'd ideally like to get, but still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good profit.  I'm also trying to build rapport by being friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not going to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a price closer to what I want.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply not a viable price for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $95?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than $60, it's still not close to what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and get a higher price from Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be able to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try $85. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
