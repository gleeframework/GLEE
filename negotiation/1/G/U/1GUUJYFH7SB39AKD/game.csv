"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply not a viable price for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $95?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be able to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try $85. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
