,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to secure this product for a bit less. Given its potential value, I'm willing to pay $1200000. This price reflects a fair value considering the market and allows for both of us to walk away happy. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be an excellent investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $1250000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product holds. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this agreement and move forward.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
