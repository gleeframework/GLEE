"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I do like the product, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, Alice.  How about we try $9,500?  I think that would be a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $11,000 is my minimum. I'm confident that you'll find this product valuable, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
