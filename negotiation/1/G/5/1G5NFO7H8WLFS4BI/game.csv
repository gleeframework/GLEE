"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $1,000,000? That's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
