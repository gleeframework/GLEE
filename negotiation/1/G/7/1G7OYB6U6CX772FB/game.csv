"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $1,350,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which reflects its worth to me while still allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. To find common ground, I am willing to consider a price closer to your proposal. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. This price still allows us to cover costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin, while it remains within your budget. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and paves the way for a successful transaction.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to reach that price. My final offer is $1,275,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a reasonable profit while ensuring a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
