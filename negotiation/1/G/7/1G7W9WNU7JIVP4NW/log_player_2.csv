"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $100. It shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate.  This should open the door for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still better off trying to negotiate further. There's still room to lower the price without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a good deal. It's also still lower than her last offer, so it should encourage her to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still think we can get a better deal.  I've demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and we've only used 5 rounds. There's still room to negotiate further, and I want to see if I can get the price down to $115 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $115. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a good deal.  It's still lower than her last offer and closer to my desired price, so it should encourage her to continue negotiating.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and while her offer is coming down, it's still not in the range where I'm comfortable accepting. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can push her closer to my desired price of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $120. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds. This offer is still a good deal for me, and it's very likely Alice will accept.  If she rejects, I'll have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is too high.  With only one round left, it's unlikely she'll come down to my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than continuing to negotiate and risking ending up with nothing."
