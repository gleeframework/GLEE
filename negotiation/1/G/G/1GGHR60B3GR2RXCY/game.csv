"Hello Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. Is that something you'd be interested in?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $90.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90, Bob. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $92.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $95, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $93.50? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm willing to accept it.",93.5,Alice,7,
