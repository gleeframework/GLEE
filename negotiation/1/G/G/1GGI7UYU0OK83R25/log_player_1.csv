"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $130, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $135 is a good offer and keeps the negotiation moving forward. It's also important to consider that we're already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
