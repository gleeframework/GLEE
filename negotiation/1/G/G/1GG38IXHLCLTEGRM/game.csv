"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the unique value and benefits this product offers, which I believe will be highly advantageous for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. While I see the value in the product, I can't justify that price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a price closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to consider $1,800,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find common ground and close this deal. ",1600000.0,Bob,6,
