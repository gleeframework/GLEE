"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a significant profit for me. I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate, as the product is worth more to him than my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my original asking price, $9,200 is a strong profit, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher.  There's a good chance I can get a better deal in future negotiations, but there's also a risk that Bob might walk away completely, and I don't want to lose out on this sale entirely."
