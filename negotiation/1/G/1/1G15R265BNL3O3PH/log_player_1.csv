Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $90. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if he counteroffers.  However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $80 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $70? "", ""product_price"": 70}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation if needed. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to pay a price that's more fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $65 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $65 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $67.50? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good price."", ""product_price"": 67.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $66? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $66. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $66
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum, I don't want to risk going lower and losing out on more money. I'm confident I can get at least $80 from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
