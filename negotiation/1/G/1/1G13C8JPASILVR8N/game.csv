"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1050000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $1050000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
