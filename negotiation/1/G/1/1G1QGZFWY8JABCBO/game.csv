"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still firm on getting at least $1,250,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1,225,000. Can we meet at this price?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
