"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  I'm open to discussion.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with $140. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $100 is still a bit low for me though.  How about $120? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,5,
