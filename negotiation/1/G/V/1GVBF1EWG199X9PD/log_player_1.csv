"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd love it. My asking price is $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  I'm open to discussion."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $140. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more. I have John as a backup if I don't get a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $100 is still a bit low for me though.  How about $120? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 120}
