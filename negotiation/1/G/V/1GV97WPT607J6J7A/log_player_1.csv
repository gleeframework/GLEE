Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly below its value to both of us.  While I aim to be flexible, I'm not willing to drop to that level.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is clearly negotiating and moving closer to a reasonable price.  $1,025,000 is more than John's offer.
