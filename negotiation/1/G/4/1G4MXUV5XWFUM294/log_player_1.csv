Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is $1,000,000 to you, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell below $1,000,000 at this point. I have more rounds to negotiate and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stick to a price closer to my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still aiming to keep the price lower. Would you consider $1,000,000 for the product? This brings us closer to the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I could try to negotiate further, I'm at my minimum price point and there's a risk Bob will walk away or I'll have to sell to John. This offer secures the deal and meets my minimum requirements."
