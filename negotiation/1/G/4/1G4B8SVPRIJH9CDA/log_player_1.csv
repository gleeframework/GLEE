Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still likely settle on a price higher than John's $8,000 offer.
* **Confidence:** Offering a strong initial price demonstrates that Alice knows the product's value. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice has a strong fallback option with John, ensuring she won't be forced to sell below her minimum acceptable price."
