Its value is significant, and I believe it holds the potential to be equally transformative for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,500,000 for it. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
While $1,500,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming higher in these early rounds. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1,500,000 is a strong offer, I'm still holding the product at a higher value.  Would you consider $1,700,000?  I believe that accurately reflects the potential we've discussed."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,600,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While $1,600,000 is tempting, I'll hold firm for one more round to see if I can push a bit higher.  I'm willing to risk losing $100,000 in potential profit for the chance to get closer to $1,700,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position on this.  Let's make this simple - I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,675,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about this deal. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1675000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I am comfortable offering $1,650,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept.  Bob is unlikely to go higher, and $1,650,000 is a great price. It's better to secure a strong deal now than risk losing him for another $25,000."
