"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is impressive, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know your thoughts.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise on my end. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $750,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That would be a great price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which is a bit above your last offer, but still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer you $710,000.  I believe that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal today.",710000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we can get a deal done today. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm excited about the prospect of selling the product to you. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  Tell you what - let's split the difference.  $715,000, and we have a deal.",715000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the way you think! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I was thinking we could meet at $718,000. This way, I can still make a decent profit, and you'll get an amazing product at a great price. What do you think?",718000.0,Alice,9,
