# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $13,000 is lower than $15,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:** While Alice could potentially lower the price further, the offer is still within your budget and saves you $2,000 compared to John's offer."
