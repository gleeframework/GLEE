Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer allows us both to benefit significantly. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while ensuring a significant profit margin.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefit"" to entice Bob.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing for bolder negotiation with Bob."
