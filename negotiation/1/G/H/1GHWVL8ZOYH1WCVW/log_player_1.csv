"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum.  This should encourage Bob to negotiate and potentially get us closer to a mutually beneficial price.  I'm also reminding him of the value of the product to sweeten the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer to show a willingness to compromise. This also positions me in a stronger negotiating position by demonstrating that I'm open to reasonable offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $10,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better deal.  I'm confident I can secure a higher price through continued negotiation, and selling to John is still an option if a deal with Bob doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $10,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $10,500, keeping it closer to my minimum price point.  I'm also emphasizing the idea of compromise to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I would like to propose $10,350 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can still push for a better deal and see if I can close the deal in the next few rounds. Selling to John is still an option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,425.  This is a very fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 10425}
```

I'm making a small concession to show that I'm serious about reaching an agreement with Bob. This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum price point.  With only a few rounds remaining, I want to put pressure on Bob to accept and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to pay $10,400 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm still slightly below my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of rounds.  It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer further, and I'm running the risk of having to sell to John for $15,000, which would be a significant loss. Accepting Bob's offer at $10,400 is the most sensible option at this point."
