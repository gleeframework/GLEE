Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. It offers unique capabilities and potential that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to that extent. How about $925,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $775,000 is just too low for me to accept.  However, I am eager to find a solution that works for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at $875,000, we have a deal.
