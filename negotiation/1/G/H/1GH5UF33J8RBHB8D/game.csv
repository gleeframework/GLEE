"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair compromise. This price is closer to my budget and would allow us to finalize the deal. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the offer of $8,750.  While I'm willing to make concessions, that price is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,900. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",8900.0,Alice,5,
