"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it looks great, $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $90? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a little high for my budget though.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? I think it's the best compromise we can reach.",85.0,Alice,5,
