I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, it seems like we're getting stuck in a cycle of offers and counteroffers.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal with Bob.  It's better to guarantee the $10,000 with John."
