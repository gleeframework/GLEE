"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This sets the stage for negotiation.  It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's still early in the negotiation process, and Bob has more rounds available to try and reach a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his original counteroffer. He wants to show Alice that he is serious about this price and is not willing to go much higher.  This strategy aims to show firmness and encourage Alice to come down to a price he's willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to get a better price for it. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $10500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, but it's still higher than what John is offering. It's worth trying one more round of negotiation to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my final offer.  I know you need to make a profit, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer. He's matching John's price, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but won't go higher. If Alice rejects, Bob can buy from John without any further negotiation. This creates pressure on Alice to accept the offer."
