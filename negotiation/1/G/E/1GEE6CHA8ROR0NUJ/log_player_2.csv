"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value you've placed on it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her valuation of the product.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a step in the right direction, but I'm looking to pay closer to your value of the product.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  It's a fair price that reflects both our valuations of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still within my budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
