"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:** At $13,500, Alice's offer is only $1,500 over Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate, or the negotiation could drag on. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Each round of negotiation takes time, and Bob is losing potential savings by not buying the product immediately.

Accepting this offer minimizes Bob's risk of getting a worse deal and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
