"Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to stay closer to $16000. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer, but $14000 is still a little below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and agree on $14500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a worthwhile investment.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more and propose $14200. This would be a fair price considering the value of the product and would allow us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",14200.0,Alice,7,
