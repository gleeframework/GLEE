"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,400. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this simple - I'm willing to pay $9,900. That's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option I have.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to go below $10,800. I've already given you a significant discount from the original price, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $10,700. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,7,
