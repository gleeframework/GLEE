Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  By offering $9,500, you're leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for yourself.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're not giving away the farm, and you're still earning more than if you sold to John. 
* **It's a friendly and encouraging message:** You want to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to engage. 

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob accepts, great! You've made a good sale. 
* **Initiate a counteroffer:** If Bob rejects, you can use his counteroffer to understand his maximum willingness to pay and adjust your strategy accordingly. 
* **Keep John as a backup:** You've set a clear benchmark with John's offer, ensuring you don't undervalue your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is far too low. It's below your minimum acceptable price, and you have a better option with John.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  Show Bob you're not desperate to sell and that you're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Set a stronger foundation for future negotiation:** A firm rejection will make him more likely to offer a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round.
* **Keep John as a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob stall, you still have the secure option of selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is my final offer. It's still a great price for the value this product delivers. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a compromise:**  It shows Bob you're willing to negotiate, but it's not a massive concession.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still earning more than you would by selling to John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not setting a hardline, so there's still space for Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants.

By making this counteroffer, you're:

* **Showing Bob you're serious:** You're willing to meet him halfway, but you're also standing your ground.
* **Guiding the negotiation:**  You've set a clear target price and made it clear that you're unlikely to go lower.
* **Maintaining your options:** You still have the option to sell to John if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  You don't want to settle for less than what you think the product is worth, especially since you have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  Show Bob you're not willing to settle for a price that undervalues your product.
* **Signal your seriousness:**  It indicates that you're not afraid to walk away if you don't get a fair deal.
* **Keep John as your safety net:**  You have a secure alternative if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate the compromise, $7,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $8,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to go no lower. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway, but you're still holding onto a good portion of your desired profit. 
* **Keep negotiations moving:** It offers Bob a chance to find a middle ground without having to make a significant concession.
* **Maintain your leverage:**  You're still holding firm on your minimum acceptable price, but you're leaving room for a final agreement. 

By making this counteroffer, you're:

* **Guiding the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial outcome:**  It encourages Bob to consider a price closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:** It keeps the conversation open and prevents negotiations from falling apart completely.
* **Staying prepared for all outcomes:**  If Bob accepts, you've made a good sale. If he rejects, you can move forward with your backup plan of selling to John."
