"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $500000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $500000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price that's higher than $500000, but lower than my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1200000 is closer to my budget, but still a bit high.  Let's split the difference and go with $900000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I could make good use of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1200000, which would be $1050000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go to $1000000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1200000? This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
