""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John who will buy it for $12,000 if Bob refuses, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob."
