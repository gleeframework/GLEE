Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving a little space between my asking price and my minimum so I can potentially come down a bit if needed.
* **Knowing My Backup:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **I have a better option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to secure a better deal than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Not Too Much:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility without immediately dropping to his price.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I emphasize that my offer is ""a great deal for you"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining My Ground:** By sticking to a price above my minimum, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price and am willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **No Guarantee of Higher Offer:** While John is willing to pay $15,000, there's no guarantee that I can achieve that price in further negotiation rounds with Bob.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I keep rejecting, there's a chance Bob might lose interest altogether, and I'd be stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John.

**Conclusion:**  Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option. It's a good price, and the potential risks of continuing to negotiate outweigh the potential benefits."
