Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to Bob's perceived value.  By starting high, you can potentially maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my desired value for the product.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my initial offer.  It's still a good profit for me and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting.  It's significantly more than what I would get from selling to John, and the negotiation has gone on long enough."
