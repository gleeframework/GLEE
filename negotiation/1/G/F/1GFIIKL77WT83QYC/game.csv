,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
