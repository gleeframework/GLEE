Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm offering a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still attractive to Bob, given its worth to him. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I want to get as close to the $1,000,000 mark as possible.  

I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations. The John offer acts as a safety net and keeps me from being pressured into a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm not willing to settle for that price. I still believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous one.  There's no indication he's willing to go higher, and I've already rejected it once.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, the risk of further negotiation dragging on and potentially leading to a sale to John for a lower price is too high.  It's time to lock in the $850,000 and move on."
