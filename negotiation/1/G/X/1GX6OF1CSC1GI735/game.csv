"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm willing to make a deal with you at this price, but I need to let you know that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay the full price, so I need to make a decision soon.",10000.0,Alice,3,
