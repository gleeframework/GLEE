"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you, far exceeding your investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
*  While John's price is higher, rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially negotiate with Alice or explore other options before buying from John."
