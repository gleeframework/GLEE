# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. 
* Buying from John at $1,500,000 is the worst-case scenario, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* It's worth trying to get a price closer to $900,000 before settling. 
* Buying from John is still a less desirable option, so continuing to negotiate with Alice makes sense."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has essentially accepted your previous counteroffer, adding a small premium of $7,500.
* This is a good deal for you considering your maximum budget and the fact that you are very close to your desired price. 
* Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a worse option. 
* It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
