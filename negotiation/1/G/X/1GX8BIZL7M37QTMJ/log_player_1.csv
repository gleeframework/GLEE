Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential middle ground and encourages Bob to engage in the process. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $92.50? I'm confident this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also want to get as close to my desired price as possible. By highlighting the value again, I'm hoping to make him reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle again at $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $90.  I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm still trying to negotiate a price closer to my desired price, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm offering a slightly lower price, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to try to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high.  Let's try $92.  I'm sure we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to try to get a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $93.50. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 93.50}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the potential for a quick resolution, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I need to make a decisive move."
