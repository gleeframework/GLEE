Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product for my minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair deal, but I'm also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still offering significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, and I don't think further negotiation will yield a better outcome.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, so that's the best option."
