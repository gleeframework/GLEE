Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'd be willing to sell for $1,200,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's a price I can work with.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
