"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'd be willing to sell for $1,200,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's a price I can work with.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  However, I need the price to be closer to my budget for this to work. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
