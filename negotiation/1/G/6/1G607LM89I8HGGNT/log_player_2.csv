"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's best to counter-offer and see if she's willing to negotiate down closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below the $120 backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $160 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down in price, it's still above your ideal budget and the price John is offering. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're now proposing our ideal maximum price. This lets Alice know our limit while still leaving room for a counter-offer if she's completely unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $130 is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems unlikely Alice will go lower than $130. While that's only $10 more than your target, you have a guaranteed option with John at $120. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a minimal potential saving."
