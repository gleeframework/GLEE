"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd love to hear if you're willing to meet me halfway.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit.

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $980000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer, so I'd like to propose a price of $990000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",990000.0,Bob,6,
