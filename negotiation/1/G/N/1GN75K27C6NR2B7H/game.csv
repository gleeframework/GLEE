"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $9,000 for the product, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Alice,5,
