Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $9,000 for the product, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer of $8,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
