Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Clear Expectations:** By stating it's a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, you avoid getting bogged down in protracted negotiations.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. If you had additional information, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
