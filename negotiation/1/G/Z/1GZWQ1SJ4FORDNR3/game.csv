"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay $10,500, while still recognizing the product's true value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
