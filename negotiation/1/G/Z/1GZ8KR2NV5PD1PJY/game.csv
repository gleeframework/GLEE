"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $12000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $10000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is my last offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
