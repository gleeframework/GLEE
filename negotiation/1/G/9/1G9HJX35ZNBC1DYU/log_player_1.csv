I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my target, $145 is still below my minimum.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm going to sell to John for $150. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than what Bob is offering and guarantees a sale."
