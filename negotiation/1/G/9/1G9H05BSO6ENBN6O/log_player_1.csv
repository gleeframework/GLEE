Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's also lower than what you could get from John, ensuring you still make a decent profit. This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, as he'll still be getting a good deal, while also maximizing your earnings."
