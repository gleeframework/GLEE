Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 is significantly lower than the product's actual value and the price I'm seeking.

This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.
