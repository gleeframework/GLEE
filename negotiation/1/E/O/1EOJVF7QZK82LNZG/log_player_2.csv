"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit high given my assessment of the product's value.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling your seriousness in negotiating. It's a reasonable starting point considering your target price and Alice's potential profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on investment. I can go down to $1,050,000,  but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, and we've only had three rounds.  There's still potential for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which would still allow you a good profit. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving closer to Alice's price but staying within my budget. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable price."
