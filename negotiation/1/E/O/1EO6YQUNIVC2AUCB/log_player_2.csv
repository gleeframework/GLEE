Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the product's value to Alice, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a strong counteroffer of $750,000, significantly lower than Alice's offer. This establishes a clear negotiation stance and tests Alice's willingness to compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $820,000 is close to Bob's maximum budget, he can still try to negotiate further. He has already established a lower price point with his previous counteroffer, and Alice has shown willingness to compromise.  There's potential for a better deal if Bob continues negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his ideal target. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $810,000 is only $10,000 more than what Bob can buy the product for from John.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the next offer and the deal could fall through.  Accepting this offer guarantees Bob the product at a price that's very close to his maximum budget."
