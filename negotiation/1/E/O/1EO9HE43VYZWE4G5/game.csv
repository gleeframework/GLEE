"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and your need to make a sale. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,200. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",12200.0,Alice,5,
