"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. He has a clear advantage knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to her.  Rejecting the offer opens the door for counter-offers and potentially a lower purchase price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. This product is valuable, but it's not quite worth $800,000 to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $750,000 is a good deal.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject his next offer or walk away from the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer secures the purchase at a price significantly lower than John's and within Bob's budget."
