"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. This product is valuable, but it's not quite worth $800,000 to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
