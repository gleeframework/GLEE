Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to understand his value perception and negotiate from there. I also have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, but it's still within the realm of what I'd consider acceptable. However, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I believe I can do better than $1,200,000, and I'm willing to risk a potential breakdown in negotiations to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also still higher than Bob's offer, indicating I believe the product is worth more.  This will hopefully incentivize Bob to meet me in the middle, and I can gauge his reaction to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000, but it's still not ideal.  At this point, I'm concerned that we're too far apart in our valuations, and the negotiation is becoming time-consuming.  While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe and guaranteed option. It's time to secure the deal and move on."
