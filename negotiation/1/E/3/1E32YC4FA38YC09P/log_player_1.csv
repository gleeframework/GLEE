Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value but also considering my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is considerably below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise, recognizing its value while still offering you a significant discount."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the compromise, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. Let's find a way to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he is far from our $1,000,000 minimum. We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the sale with John."
