"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value but also considering my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is considerably below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise, recognizing its value while still offering you a significant discount.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate the compromise, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. Let's find a way to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
