Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
