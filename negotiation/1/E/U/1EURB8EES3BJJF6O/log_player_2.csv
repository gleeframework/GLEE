"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm looking for a price around $1,150,000 to reflect its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good deal, Bob can still potentially save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
