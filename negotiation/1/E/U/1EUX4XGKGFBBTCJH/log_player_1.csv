Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Secure a Deal Quickly:**  While John offers a safety net, selling to Bob at $14,000 is a better deal and avoids potential delays."
