"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, given its value to me. I think this is a fair price that reflects the potential benefit to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
