"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to recoup a significant portion of the investment I made in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, and it allows for a profitable transaction. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession.  How about $1,350,000? This would allow us to both make a fair profit.  I believe this is a good compromise considering our past discussions.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1,350,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,300,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
