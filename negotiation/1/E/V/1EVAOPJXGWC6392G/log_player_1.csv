"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as justified due to the product's value, without revealing my own valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, indicating I'm willing to negotiate. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts a high price, it's a win.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, counteroffer) reveals valuable information about his willingness to pay.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** Setting the initial price anchors the negotiation and gives me an advantageous starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). I have a guaranteed offer from John at that minimum, so there's no reason to settle for less. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a higher price and am willing to walk away from the deal. This keeps the door open for further negotiation.  I'm confident I can still reach a more favorable agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm lowering my price, but only slightly, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value to justify the price. 
* **""Meet in the middle"":**  This framing makes the offer seem more appealing and fair, even though the midpoint is subjective.  

This approach aims to:

1. **Maintain Value Perception:**  I don't want to drop the price too drastically, which could signal desperation or lower the product's perceived value in Bob's mind.
2. **Test Bob's Willingness:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to significantly increase his offer.
3. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** There's still space for further adjustments if needed within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has only increased by $50,000 from his previous offer. This suggests he is very unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds to reach my minimum price of $1,200,000.  

I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price in the limited rounds remaining."
