Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, knowing it's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm going to counter with $87. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $82 is still above my minimum and a decent profit.  There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer secures a good deal."
