Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $1,300,000, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a high point. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, his counter-offers might be closer to your desired range than if you had started lower. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  You always have John as a backup buyer. If negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial price is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this lowball offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  We're making a substantial step down from $1,300,000 to $1,100,000, showing Bob we're flexible. However, we're staying firmly above our $1,000,000 floor.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""true value,"" we're subtly reminding Bob of his own $800,000 valuation.
* **Urgency:** We haven't explicitly threatened to go to John yet, but implying there's a ""middle ground"" suggests time might be a factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Perhaps we can agree on $700,000?  This offer shows I'm serious about buying while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your $1,000,000 threshold.  Bob inching up to $700,000 indicates he's willing to negotiate within a certain range, but that range might not be favorable to you.  It's time to apply more pressure by bringing John into the picture."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've received a compelling offer from another buyer for $1,000,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic about my options. I'm willing to hold my offer at $1,050,000 for the next 24 hours. After that, I'll need to proceed with the other offer. This is your chance to acquire a valuable product at a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing John:**  By explicitly mentioning John's $1,000,000 offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Final Offer:** We're giving Bob a final offer of $1,050,000 â€“ a small but acceptable margin above our absolute minimum.  This shows we're serious about closing the deal but not desperate.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour deadline adds pressure for Bob to make a decision without giving him too much time to counter. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer or making a substantial counter-offer."
