Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've received a compelling offer from another buyer for $1,000,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic about my options. I'm willing to hold my offer at $1,050,000 for the next 24 hours. After that, I'll need to proceed with the other offer. This is your chance to acquire a valuable product at a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While Alice's price is getting closer to a reasonable range, it's clear she's trying to anchor the negotiations close to her desired value.  John's offer of $800,000 is the maximum I'm willing to spend, and further haggling with Alice might not yield a better outcome.  It's time to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
