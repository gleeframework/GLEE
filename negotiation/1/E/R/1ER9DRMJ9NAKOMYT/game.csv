,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original price. How about $10,500? This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
