"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since you're already within a range where you can potentially get the product for less than John's price, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,075,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and at $1,087,500 you're getting the product for less than John's price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially asking for a higher price.  It's better to secure the deal now at a price that's still good for you."
