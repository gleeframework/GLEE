"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,000. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I can compromise further, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting closer.  How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $8,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $9,200. This is the lowest I can go while still making a decent profit.",9200.0,Alice,7,
