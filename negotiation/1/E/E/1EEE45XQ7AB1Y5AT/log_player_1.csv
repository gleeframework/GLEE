Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce. 
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out as you have John willing to buy it at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
