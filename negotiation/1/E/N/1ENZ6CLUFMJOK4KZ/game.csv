"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident this price allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $920,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",920000.0,Bob,4,
