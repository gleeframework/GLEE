{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm also keeping the door open for negotiation to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100 yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I'll make one last offer of $100. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer matches my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price as John's offer.  There's no reason to keep negotiating; I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
