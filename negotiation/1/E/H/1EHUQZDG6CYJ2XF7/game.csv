"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a little steep for me. Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $14,500? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I can do $14,000.  That's a fair offer considering John can sell it to me right now.",14000.0,Bob,6,
