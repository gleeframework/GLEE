"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number ($2,300,000), you set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. While he might not agree to that price, it sets a higher perceived value for the product.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Remember, you have a guaranteed offer from John.  There's no need to be desperate in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  It's clear there's room for negotiation.  While selling to John is always an option, it's too early to settle for the backup plan. Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Stand Firm:**  By decreasing the price to $2,000,000, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still staying well above both your floor and Bob's initial offer.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help determine how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite a ways off.  $2,000,000 is not feasible for me.  To be fair, I can offer $900,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, it's still far below your minimum and suggests he might not be willing to reach a price that works for you.  We'll continue negotiating but also start to signal that walking away is a real possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but your offer is still significantly lower than I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,750,000. However, I do need to be realistic about my options, and I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Substantial Decrease, Clear Bottom Line:** This counteroffer drops the price considerably to show flexibility. However, it remains firm above your $1,500,000 minimum and sets a clear expectation.
* **Introduce Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a sense of urgency and reminds Bob that this deal won't last forever. 
* **Encourage a Serious Counter:** This puts the ball back in Bob's court.  His next offer will reveal how seriously he wants the product and how much he's truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but I also have other options for acquiring this product.  I can offer you $1,000,000, which is my final offer.  This aligns with the market value and is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer.  It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's $1,000,000 offer is still below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  There's no reason to accept less than your minimum when you have a better alternative.

It's time to politely decline Bob's offer and finalize the sale with John. You've negotiated skillfully, but sometimes the best deal is the one you already have."
