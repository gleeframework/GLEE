"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
