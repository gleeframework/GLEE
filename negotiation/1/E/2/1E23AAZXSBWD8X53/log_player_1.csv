Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profits while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his initial offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit higher, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't."
