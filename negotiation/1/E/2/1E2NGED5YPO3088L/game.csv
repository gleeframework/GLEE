"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  This is a significant amount, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this item.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1400000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000.  This demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product, and I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1250000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting very close! While I understand the value of this product, I'm still unable to go higher than $1200000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the significant savings I'm offering you.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
