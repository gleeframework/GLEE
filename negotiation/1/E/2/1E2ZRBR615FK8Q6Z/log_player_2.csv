# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. After careful consideration and evaluation, I propose to sell this unique item to you at a special price of $950,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its true worth of $1,200,000, making it an attractive proposition for someone as discerning as yourself. I am confident that this investment will not only meet but exceed your expectations. Should you decide to proceed, I am here to facilitate a smooth transaction. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While you could pay John $1,200,000, Alice is offering a lower price of $950,000.
* **The product is still worth more to Bob than the asking price.** Even at $950,000, Bob is getting a good deal as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option for Bob."
