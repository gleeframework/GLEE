"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can aim for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'd like to counter with a price of $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high for Bob's budget.  Although it's closer to Bob's limit, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move forward with a purchase if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'd like to counter with a price of $1,020,000 for the product. This is my last offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his maximum budget and Alice is getting closer to her minimum.  This means the negotiation is likely to end with a price that is not ideal for either party.  By buying from John, Bob can save $20,000 compared to Alice's final offer, while still securing the product."
