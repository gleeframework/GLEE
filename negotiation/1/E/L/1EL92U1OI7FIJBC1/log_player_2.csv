"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $10,000 is lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to you ($12,000). 
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  
* **Avoiding immediate purchase:** Buying from John now would be a waste of your bargaining power and could result in paying more than necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive yet reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your desire to negotiate.
* **Within your budget:**  $9,000 is still within your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** There's still room to lower the price if Alice is unwilling to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $9,500 is very close to your initial counteroffer of $9,000 and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000.
* **Risk of escalation:** Rejecting Alice's offer could lead to further negotiation rounds and potentially a higher final price, or even a stalemate.
* **Time constraint:** With only 7 rounds remaining, accepting the offer helps secure the product without risking running out of time."
