"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a strong opening offer, aiming to maximize my profit. I'm confident that the product is worth enough to Bob that he'll be willing to negotiate.  We'll see how he responds."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident that I can get a higher offer from Bob if I continue to negotiate.  I'm not in a rush, and I have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as we are nearing the halfway point in our negotiations."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While we are getting closer, $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. We only have a few rounds left, but I'm hoping to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While Bob's offer of $9,900 is very close to my minimum, I'm not confident that we will reach a deal in the remaining rounds. It's important to secure a price that meets my minimum requirement, and John's offer provides that. I'm happy to close the deal with him and move on."
