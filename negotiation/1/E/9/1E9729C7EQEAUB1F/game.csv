"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1175000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1150000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
