{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for potential bargaining.  It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to go up to $9,100 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,100 is only $100 less than my counteroffer of $9,250. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
