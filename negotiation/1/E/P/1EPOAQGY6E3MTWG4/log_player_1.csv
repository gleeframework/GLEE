This is a starting point. I've chosen a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation.  I've also made it clear that this is a good deal for both of us, which might make Bob more willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $762,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $762,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 800000}
