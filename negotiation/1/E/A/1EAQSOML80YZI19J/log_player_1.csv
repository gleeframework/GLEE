Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that's worth a significant amount to me. I believe it could be of great value to you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it gives him a potential profit margin.  
* **The message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximize profit:** $900,000 is a good middle ground, potentially earning more than selling to John while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  The price is not so high as to be immediately rejected.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation if Bob feels the price is too high."
