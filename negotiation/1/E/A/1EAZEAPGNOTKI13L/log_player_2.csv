# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, it's closer to your ideal price than her previous offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get her down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000.
