"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message aims to maintain a positive and respectful tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Significant but not Unreasonable:**  $1,100,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's offer but is still a profitable price for Alice considering her valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I am serious about purchasing it. Let's find some common ground. How about $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice came down $100,000, so it's reasonable to show willingness to compromise by also moving closer to her price.  $1,200,000 is a significant step towards that.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):** The phrase ""Let's find some common ground""  subtly implies a desire to close the deal sooner rather than later,  which could encourage Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Still Below John's Price:**  We're still well below John's $1,500,000 offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
