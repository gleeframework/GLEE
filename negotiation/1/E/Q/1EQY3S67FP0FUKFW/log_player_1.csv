"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, this offer leaves some potential profit for him while also maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get closer to my target of $12,000.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, giving me enough time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $10,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. It's a good midpoint between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $12,000.  This leaves some room for further negotiation, depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has increased his offer to $9,500, which is getting closer to my desired price point.  While it's still below my initial target of $12,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  This deal provides a decent profit for me, and further negotiation might not be worth the risk of Bob walking away."
