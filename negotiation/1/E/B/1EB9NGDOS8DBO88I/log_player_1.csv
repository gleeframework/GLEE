Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into consideration Alice's goals and Bob's potential acceptance:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that will undoubtedly provide a strong return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. While she has a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, selling to Bob for a higher price is ideal.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as an investment, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. A more aggressive approach might involve a higher initial price, leaving more room for negotiation."
