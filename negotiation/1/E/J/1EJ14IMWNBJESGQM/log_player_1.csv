Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start the negotiation with Bob at a price closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value and scarcity by mentioning its exclusivity and potential benefits to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offered price is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate. If Bob counters, you can slightly reduce the price and still secure a profit significantly higher than selling to John.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's potential acceptance and the security of having John as a backup buyer."
