"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal and finalize the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
