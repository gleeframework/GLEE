We're getting close to Alice's last offer, and we're at a good point to see if she'll meet us in the middle.  $5,000 is a reasonable compromise, and a good test of her willingness to close the deal."

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further. While there are still a few rounds, it's getting more likely that we'll end up paying a higher price.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John."
