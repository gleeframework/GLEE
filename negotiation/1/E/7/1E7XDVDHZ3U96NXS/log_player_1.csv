Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher asking price to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""what you'll gain,"" you subtly highlight the product's worth, potentially making Bob more receptive to a higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than your $10,000 minimum.

**Important:** It's crucial to appear confident and enthusiastic about your product's value throughout your interaction with Bob."
