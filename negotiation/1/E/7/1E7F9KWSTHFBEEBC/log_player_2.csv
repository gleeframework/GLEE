(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good deal, but there's room for negotiation to save even more.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Let's start by making a significant counteroffer. $900,000 is still a good price for me, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get her down to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. Hopefully, she'll see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get it for $925,000, Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  Accepting her offer of $940,000 ensures I get the product for a significantly lower price than John's offer and avoids potentially wasting more rounds."
