Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $90, you are aiming for a price that is appealing to Bob (as it's below his valuation) while also maximizing your potential profit.  

This approach attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and getting the best possible price."
