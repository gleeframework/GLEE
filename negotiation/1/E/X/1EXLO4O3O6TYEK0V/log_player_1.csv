"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also trying to frame it as a fair compromise to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the price I can get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer will secure the sale and allow me to move on. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for the same price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
