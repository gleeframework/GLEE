"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the price I can get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
