I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $1200000, but I can also offer it to you for $1200000, and throw in a few extras that will make it worth your while. Alternatively, I can sell it to you for $1200000 and give you a 5% discount for a quick cash payment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
