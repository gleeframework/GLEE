Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line.  This gives you negotiating power.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out, even if the price is higher than he initially intended. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** You don't know Bob's financial limits or how much he's willing to spend.  There's a chance this offer will be rejected outright. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate down from your initial price. Having a clear strategy for how low you're willing to go will be important."
