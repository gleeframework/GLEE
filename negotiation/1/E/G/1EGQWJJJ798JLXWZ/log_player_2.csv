# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer because the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and she is asking for $1,550,000, which is too expensive. I will look for a better deal elsewhere.
