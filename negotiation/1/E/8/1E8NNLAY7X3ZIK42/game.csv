"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great value for what you'll be getting.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  $12,500 is very close.  How about we split the difference and do $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12200.0,Alice,7,
