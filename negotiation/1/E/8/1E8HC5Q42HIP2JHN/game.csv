"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
