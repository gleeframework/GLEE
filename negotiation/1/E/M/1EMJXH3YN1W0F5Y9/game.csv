"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get a fair value for my product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit on the sale. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. I think this is the highest I can go, and I hope you can meet me there. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Bob,6,
