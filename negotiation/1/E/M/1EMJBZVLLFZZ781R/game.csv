"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to your response!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still a bit far off from that number. How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
