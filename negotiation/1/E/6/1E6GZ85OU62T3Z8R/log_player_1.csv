Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,300,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room for More:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my $1,000,000 minimum, but still significantly below his perceived value of $1,500,000 and my initial offer. 
* **Negotiating Position:** Rejecting this offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm not in a rush because I have John as a guaranteed buyer. This allows me to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially considering the benefits it will bring you. Could you consider $1,225,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still aiming for a price above the midpoint ($1,150,000) between our last two offers.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of his $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Strategic Concession:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand its value, but I do have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,160,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit Margin:** $1,160,000 is a significant profit over my $1,000,000 minimum and a decent return on the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might alienate Bob, or we could get stuck haggling over relatively small amounts.  
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now brings in the money sooner. Prolonging negotiations delays the profit and has the potential to fall apart."
