"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has great potential and would be a great addition to your portfolio. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for you to secure a better price, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by going with John."
