"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
