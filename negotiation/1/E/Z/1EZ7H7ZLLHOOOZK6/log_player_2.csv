"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects its true worth.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 still doesn't reflect the unique value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $975,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the fact that John is offering $1,000,000.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $975,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than her starting price and a $25,000 savings compared to John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result and risks losing the deal altogether."
