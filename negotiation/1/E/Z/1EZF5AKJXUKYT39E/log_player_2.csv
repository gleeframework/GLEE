"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  Rejecting allows for potential negotiation and a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
