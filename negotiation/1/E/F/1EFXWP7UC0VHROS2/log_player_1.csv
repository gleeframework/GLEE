Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than its value to him.

Let's see what Bob thinks!"

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $140. Since $140 is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150), I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.
