{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's still a decent profit for me.  I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $14,000 is still a good price, but I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $14,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that's profitable for me. I'm hoping to reach a deal quickly, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,200 is only $300 less than my last counteroffer. At this point, I'm willing to take the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer of $10,000.  It's a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
