"Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,1,
