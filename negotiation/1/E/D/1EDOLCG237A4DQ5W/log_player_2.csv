"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice's minimum is $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. How about $13,000? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm looking for something closer to $13,750.  This product is truly top-notch, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is $13,750, and your maximum is $15,000. This means you can save $1,250 by accepting her offer instead of buying from John.  While you could counteroffer again, you risk Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving up the price. It's better to accept the offer and save some money."
