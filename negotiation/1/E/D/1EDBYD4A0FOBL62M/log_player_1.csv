Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. 
* **Considering John:** I'm aware that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not overly aggressive in my initial offer. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob a chance to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still lower than my goal of at least $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum and I believe I can push him closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  John's offer represents my absolute minimum. I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,125,000, which is $25,000 higher than his offer and $25,000 lower than my initial offer.
* **Reasonable compromise:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Pressure on Bob:** By offering a price closer to his initial counteroffer, I'm putting pressure on him to accept or risk losing a good deal. 

By offering a compromise that's still within my acceptable range, I aim to secure a good deal while keeping the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $1,075,000 is slightly less than my ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that he'll walk away completely or continue lowering his offer.
* **Securing a decent profit:** Accepting his offer ensures a decent profit, which is much better than selling to John for $1,000,000. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a good deal and avoiding the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or no deal at all."
