"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to both of us, I propose a price of $14000 to ensure we both benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his ideal price point. By acknowledging Alice's perspective, he's trying to maintain a positive and open negotiation. This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product to you, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $13500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's target of $13,000. While he could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and further stall the negotiation. Accepting this offer saves him $500 compared to buying from John and leaves room for potential future gains if he can resell the product at a higher price."
