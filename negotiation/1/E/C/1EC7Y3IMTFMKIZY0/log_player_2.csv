Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $7,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,500.  This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at this point."
