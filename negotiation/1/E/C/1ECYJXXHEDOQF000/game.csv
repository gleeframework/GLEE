"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,16000.0
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to consider a price of $16000. This is the best I can do at this time.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15500? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,15800.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $15800, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers...",15800.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher.  However, $15800 is still stretching my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $15400?  It's a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",15400.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,15700.0
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15400, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'll throw in some additional support and training to help you get the most out of the product. In return, I'd like to get $15700. It's a fair price considering the extras I'm offering.",15700.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate the added value of the training, and I'm willing to pay a bit more for that.  However, $15700 is still pushing my budget. How about we split the difference at $15500?  That would allow me to get the training and stay within my financial limits.",15500.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,15650.0
"I'm glad you like the added value, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to $15500. I'll meet you at $15650, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product and the training.",15650.0,Alice,9,,
