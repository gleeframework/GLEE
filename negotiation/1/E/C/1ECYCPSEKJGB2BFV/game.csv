"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the product's value to me while ensuring a profitable transaction for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,030,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to both of us.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
