{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses openness to negotiation, signaling that a deal is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and even the middle ground he suggests is still below my floor. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $14,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,250? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident we'll be able to agree on a price that works for both of us. It's better to sell to John now and guarantee the $15,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially get less."
