Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
