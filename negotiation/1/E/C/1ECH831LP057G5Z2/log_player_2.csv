Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a lower price to see how Alice reacts."

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my limit. I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, moving closer to Alice's price but still significantly lower than her initial offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget."

Alice's offer is still higher than my limit. While it's tempting to buy from her to avoid further negotiation, the risk of not reaching a better price with John is too high. I will continue to try to negotiate with Alice, but keep John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's also a price that's still within my budget, but close enough to Alice's that she may be willing to accept it."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Alice's offer is very close to my limit, but I'm not willing to risk going another round and potentially ending up with a higher price. John's offer is a guaranteed deal within my budget, and it's time to secure the purchase."
