"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit margin.
* **Gauge Bob's Position:** This initial offer will help me understand Bob's willingness to pay and his negotiation style. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the backup plan of John offering $800,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant jump down from my initial ask. While it's above my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I believe $1,050,000 is a more accurate reflection of its worth. This price still offers you significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to my desired price point.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A $50,000 decrease might seem small, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting me at $1,000,000 is a good deal. This price exceeds my minimum by a healthy margin ($200,000 profit) and represents a successful negotiation. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it at this point."
