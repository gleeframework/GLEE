Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $88? That's only $3 away from your offer, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $88 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. That's a good deal for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price of $80, I'd like to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I still have four rounds left."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $82.50 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't quite go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go a bit lower than $82.50, but I'm not willing to go back up to $85. How about $81.25? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $81.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd still like to get closer to $85,  I only have two rounds left, and  $81.25 is a better deal than what John is offering. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
