"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This offer reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price considering the long-term benefits you'll reap.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my acceptable range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it fairly reflects the product's potential benefits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, we're still a considerable distance apart.  I'm willing to accept $1,800,000, as this represents a significant concession on my end.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair given the product's potential.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've made concessions, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my financial limit. To finalize this deal, I'm offering $1,550,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable compromise for both parties. Let's work together to reach an agreement before time runs out.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
