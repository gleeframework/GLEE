Given its value and the impact it could have on your company, I am offering it to you for $11,500. This price reflects the high quality and unique features of the product while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. I am confident that this investment will pay off in terms of efficiency gains and cost savings for your organization. Please let me know if you require any further information or demonstrations to help you make an informed decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob could potentially get the product for a lower price from Alice if he rejects the offer and negotiates further,  buying from Alice at $11,500 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. Bob is still saving money and achieving his goal of acquiring the product within his budget."
