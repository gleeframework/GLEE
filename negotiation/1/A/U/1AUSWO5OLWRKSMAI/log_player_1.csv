I'm starting with an ambitious offer, aiming for a 10% markup. This initial offer signals my confidence in the product's value and sets a high starting point for negotiation."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit. I'm confident this offer will be more attractive to Bob than his previous offer, and will keep the negotiation moving forward."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of significantly cutting my profit. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is a firm offer, indicating my unwillingness to go lower. It's a risky move, but with only 5 rounds remaining, it's time to see if Bob will meet my bottom line."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Time is running out, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not confident I can reach an agreement with Bob in the remaining rounds. To ensure I get my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
