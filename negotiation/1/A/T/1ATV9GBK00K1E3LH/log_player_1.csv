Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You still make a profit if he accepts.
* **It's friendly:** Starting with a positive tone can help build rapport. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95.  How about we split the difference? "", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm willing to compromise but not drastically.
* **Gives a reason:** Providing a reason (splitting the difference) makes the offer more appealing. 
* **Keeps the negotiation going:** This keeps the door open to reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $92. Can you go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $120. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go any lower than $93.  This is a great price for a product that you'll really enjoy. What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 93} 
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking closer to my minimum but still offering a compromise.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I'm still not comfortable with $93. Can you meet me at $89? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $89 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like we're at an impasse. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $120. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum price than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
