{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price higher than that to entice him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also signals that the product is valuable.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so any price Bob accepts above that is profit. 

By aiming high but staying within a reasonable range of Bob's valuation, we maximize our potential profit while still making the offer attractive to him."
