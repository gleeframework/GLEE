"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $11,500. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's profitable for me. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer before we run out of rounds."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, though it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since we have several rounds left. I'll continue to counter with higher offers in the next round, hoping to reach a deal closer to my desired price."
