"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, Bob has room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strategic move to see if Alice is willing to budge.  Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $10,000 but still leaving room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reduced her offer to $11,000, which is still above Bob's target price. However, it's closer than her first offer. Bob should continue negotiating in the hopes of getting closer to his desired price, which is closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal.  $10,750 is a middle ground between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,850 is very close to Bob's target price and significantly better than John's offer of $12,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, accepting the offer at this point secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further rounds.  There's a chance Alice might reject a counteroffer, and Bob could end up paying more than $10,850, or even be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's best to lock in this deal."
