"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential counteroffers without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, we can likely push for a better deal with Bob. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
This counteroffer is still below Bob's value but significantly higher than Bob's last offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while ensuring we don't get stuck with a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close enough to our target price that it's worth accepting. We've made progress in the negotiation and selling to John would result in a lower profit."
