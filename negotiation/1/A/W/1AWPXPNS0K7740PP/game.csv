"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, and I think you'll find it very attractive. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $875000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $825000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be mindful of my own valuation. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, which is the lowest I can go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
