"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value you're looking to get and allows for a fair profit for you while also meeting my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to my target value by counter-offering. There are 8 rounds left, providing room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest in the product, $900,000 doesn't reflect its full potential value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to meet you halfway.  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable return while offering you a significant opportunity for growth.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This would give you a healthy profit margin while still allowing me to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I need to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better offer. With 6 rounds left, I have time to explore further options."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below the value I need to achieve for this product. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This allows for a significant profit for you and still reflects the true value of the product. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product.  This represents a good compromise that allows for both of us to achieve a positive outcome. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm determined to achieve a better price, and with four rounds remaining, I believe there's still room for negotiation.
