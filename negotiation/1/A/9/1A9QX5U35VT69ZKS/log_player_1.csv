Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point for negotiation.  I'm offering a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers. 

I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John for $15,000, so I need to find a balance between getting the best price and not letting the negotiation drag on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and also lower than my initial offer of $20,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum value. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  I'm content with accepting this offer to secure the sale. Continuing to negotiate risks dragging the process out and potentially losing both Bob and John as buyers."
