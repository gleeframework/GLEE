{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can still negotiate a better price and I don't want to sell below my minimum value of $1,500,000 just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum price point. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a figure closer to $1,350,000 to move forward. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the market value of the product.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, considering the value to you and the market value of the product. How about we meet at $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value and secures a sale.  There's always a risk of further negotiation, and I don't want to push my luck and potentially lose the deal altogether."
