# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You can try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's final offer is still too high for Bob's budget. It makes more sense to buy the product from John for $800,000 and save $200,000."
