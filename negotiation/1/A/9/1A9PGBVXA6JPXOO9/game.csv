"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This is my best offer, as I'm  constrained by my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being transparent about your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? This is a fair price that is closer to our  target.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
