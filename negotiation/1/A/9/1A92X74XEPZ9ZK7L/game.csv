"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. My initial offer is $130. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. How about $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $115 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $118 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise at $119. It's only a dollar more, and it's a great deal for you, considering the product's worth.",119.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Alice. I can do $117, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",117.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time, and $117 is still a bit too low for me.  To avoid losing out, I'm willing to go down to $118.  It's a fair deal, and we can finally close this deal.",118.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $118. I'm willing to meet you at $116, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John.",116.0,Bob,10,
