"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I am only able to pay up to $1,250,000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this offer meets your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little off from where I need to be. How about $1,550,000? This is a very reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This price aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the value I see in the item. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for a higher price. I think I can still push for a slightly higher price from Bob.  I'll make one more counteroffer in the next round, and if he rejects it, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's the best chance we have to close this deal.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, after careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range and allows us to conclude this transaction.

It's time to move on.  Bob's offer is close, but I've only got two rounds left.  I don't want to risk losing out on the higher price from John.  It's time to sell to John and secure the $1,500,000."
