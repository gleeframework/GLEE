Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for [price slightly higher than $80, for example, $85]. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

This offer strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  By offering a price slightly higher than your minimum, you see if Bob is willing to pay more than John.
* **Maximize profit potential:** If Bob accepts, you earn more than selling to John. 
* **Guarantee a sale:** If Bob rejects, you have a guaranteed sale to John for your minimum price."
