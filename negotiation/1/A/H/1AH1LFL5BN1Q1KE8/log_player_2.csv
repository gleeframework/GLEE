"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  He can potentially get the product for closer to his desired price or even closer to Alice's valuation of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $11,000, and it's also lower than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
