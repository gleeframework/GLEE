"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price. $95 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to at least cover my costs. Let's make this happen!",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $96. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. $96 is still below my bottom line.  If you're serious about buying this product, I'm willing to meet you at $97. It's a fair price for both of us.",97.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $95. That's the absolute highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,8,
