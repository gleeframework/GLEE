"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob could potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Alice.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate. 

Therefore, Bob decides to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
