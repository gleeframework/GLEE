Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000 for the product. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves a potential profit range of $200,000 for both of us.
* **Initial Offer:** My initial offer of $1,150,000 is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It is a fair offer considering Bob's value, while still securing a significant profit for myself.

**Next Steps:** 

I will observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response. If he counteroffers, I'll evaluate his offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll consider lowering my price slightly, but I won't go below $1,050,000. If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is only $50,000 less than my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Costs:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price or delaying the sale.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, but accepting Bob's offer yields an additional $100,000. 

**Conclusion:** 

While $1,100,000 is not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that secures a quick sale and a significant profit. The potential for further negotiation is small, and the risk of losing the sale outweighs the possibility of a slightly higher price."
