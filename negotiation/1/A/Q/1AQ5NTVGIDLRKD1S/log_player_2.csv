"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

Bob should start by offering his maximum price, $80. While Alice likely won't accept this right away, it establishes Bob's firm budget and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the leverage on Bob's side.  He's demonstrated he's serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $90. This shows Alice he is willing to compromise while still staying within his budget. This increase is more likely to encourage Alice to accept the offer, as it's a reasonable compromise from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount above what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price lower before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

Bob should offer $100. This is a fair compromise: it's a significant increase from his previous offer, showing he's serious about buying, while also still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $105 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are only a few rounds left, so he needs to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

Bob should offer $102. This is a small increase from his previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise but also that he is firm about not going over his budget. With only two rounds left, this final attempt at negotiation might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
