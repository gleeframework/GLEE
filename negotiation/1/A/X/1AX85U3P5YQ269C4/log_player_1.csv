"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm not willing to drop down to $900,000. I'll counter with a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my bottom line, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me significantly more.  It's better to take this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
