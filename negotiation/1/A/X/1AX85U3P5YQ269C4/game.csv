"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
