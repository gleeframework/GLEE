Alice has come back to her original price.  This indicates she might be unwilling to negotiate further. While I could continue trying to get a lower price, with only a few rounds left, it's more efficient to buy from John.  I'm guaranteed the product at my maximum price, and I can avoid further negotiation and the risk of not reaching an agreement."
