Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I still think we can reach a better agreement.  I'll counter in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,280,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

{

}
```

While a higher price is ideal, Bob has consistently shown he's unwilling to go above $1,300,000. Accepting his $1,280,000 offer is a good business decision at this point, securing a significant profit over John's standing offer."
