Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This allows for some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Understanding John:**  Knowing John will pay $8,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product for a decent price.
* **Potential for profit:** I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product beyond $8,000 and is willing to pay closer to $9,000. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
