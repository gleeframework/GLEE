Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a good return.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

By offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, you're aiming to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and keeping the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the $950,000 you initially offered. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can attempt to secure a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows your willingness to negotiate but not cave in to his initial low offer.
* **Lower than your initial offer:**  This demonstrates flexibility and leaves room for a potential agreement. 

By offering $900,000, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to the $800,000 offer from John. While it's still lower than your initial target, it's a reasonable price considering the risk of further negotiation and potential delays. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a faster sale and a decent profit."
