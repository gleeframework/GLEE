"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However,  $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This price is still fair for both of us, and I believe it's a great way to move forward with this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000.  This price is fair and allows for both of us to make a good deal.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",875000.0,Alice,5,
