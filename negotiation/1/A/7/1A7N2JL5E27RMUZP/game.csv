"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $15000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. How about $17500? It's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be happy.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16250. Can you consider this revised offer?",16250.0,Bob,4,
