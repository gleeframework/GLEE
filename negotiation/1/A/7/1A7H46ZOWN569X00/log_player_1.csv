"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but still leaves room for some profit."
