"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal value while still leaving some room for negotiation. This should demonstrate my seriousness in getting a good deal but also leave space for Alice to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer.  While $950,000 is still above my ideal value, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or losing the opportunity to John."
