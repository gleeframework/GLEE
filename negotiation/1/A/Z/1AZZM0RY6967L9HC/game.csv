"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering your value and my own.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that leaves us both with a good margin. Let's close this deal!",875000.0,Bob,4,
