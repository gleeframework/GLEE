Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering your value and my own.  What do you think?
