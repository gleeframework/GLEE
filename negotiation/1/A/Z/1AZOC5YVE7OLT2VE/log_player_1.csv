"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes a high starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm willing to take a risk for a potentially much higher return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired value.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. It gives Bob room to negotiate but also pushes him closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what I would get from John.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with the lower price from John."
