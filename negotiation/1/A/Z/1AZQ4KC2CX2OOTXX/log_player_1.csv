Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I have a strong position. Offering the product to Bob at $20,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.  

**Here's why this strategy makes sense:**

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($20,000) sets a psychological anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started at a lower price.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer gauges Bob's interest level and willingness to pay. His response will guide my next move in the negotiation. 
* **No risk:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
