"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,400,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000. This still allows me to get a fair return on my investment while recognizing the value you see in the product.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
