Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe you'll find valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $10,000, aiming for a price slightly below that maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John provides a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
