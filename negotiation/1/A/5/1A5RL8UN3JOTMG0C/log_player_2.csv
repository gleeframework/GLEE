"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Its value is substantial, and I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for you. To start our discussion, I'm proposing a price of $1500000.  This reflects the product's unique capabilities and the significant benefit it can bring to your business. I'm open to discussing further, but I'm confident this price is a fair reflection of its worth. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value this product offers.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still allows for significant profit potential for you and recognizes the unique capabilities of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
