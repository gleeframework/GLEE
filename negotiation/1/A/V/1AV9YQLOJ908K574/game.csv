"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for what's being offered.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can offer at this point.",900000.0,Bob,4,
