"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping we can agree on a price closer to my initial offer. How about $14000? This price still reflects the product's exceptional qualities and the potential it holds for your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider this offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $13000.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14000.  I truly believe this product will be worth the investment for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to make one more offer: $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,6,
