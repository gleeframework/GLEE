"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'll see if I can get him closer to $15,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping we can agree on a price closer to my initial offer. How about $14,000? This price still reflects the product's exceptional qualities and the potential it holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but I still think I can do better. I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $13,000.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14,000.  I truly believe this product will be worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to make one more offer: $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still not ideal, it's a significant improvement from his previous offers and a good deal considering the risk of him walking away. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm going to accept his offer."
