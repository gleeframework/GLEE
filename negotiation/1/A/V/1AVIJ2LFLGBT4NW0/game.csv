"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm not sure I can go as high as $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,500?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product.  Would you consider a price of $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'm offering $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need for this product. Would you consider a price of $10,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable, and I'm willing to make this final concession.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any higher. I'm really hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. ",9500.0,Bob,6,
