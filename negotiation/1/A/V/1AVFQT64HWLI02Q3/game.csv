"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  The value of this product is truly unique, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial benefits.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This offer represents a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand the value you place on this product, $1,325,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
