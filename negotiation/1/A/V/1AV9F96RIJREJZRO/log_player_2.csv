"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Since I value the product at $1,000,000, I can afford to pay slightly more than Alice's offer but still save a significant amount.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be happy to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the value it brings and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  This price is still below my valuation of $1,000,000, allowing me to save money.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might become unwilling to budge further or I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without the risk of further negotiation."
