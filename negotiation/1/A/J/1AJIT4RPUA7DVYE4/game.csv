"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 seems a little high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but $140 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,5,
