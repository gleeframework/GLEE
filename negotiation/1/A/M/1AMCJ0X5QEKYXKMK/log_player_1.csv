"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $200, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to see how much Bob values the product and potentially get a good price without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $200 is a bit steep for me. How about $175? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While $175 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to try to push for a higher price.
* **More Negotiating Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the price further.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my desired range, especially considering I have multiple rounds remaining.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still above $175."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer! $175 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Would you be willing to go to $185? It's a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 185} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Justification:**  I'm not just rejecting his offer; I'm providing a specific reason (fair price for value) for my counteroffer.
* **Slight Increase:** My counteroffer is a modest increase from his offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the conversation open and avoid turning Bob off. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still keeping my goal of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $185 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $180?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Point:**  Bob's offer of $180 is very close to my desired price range and represents a good compromise.
* **Time is Money:**  We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a good price without risking further rounds of back-and-forth, potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net,  $180 is a significantly better deal for me.

**Next Steps:** I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
