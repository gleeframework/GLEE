"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your perspective. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows for a mutually beneficial partnership.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still a bit off your offer. To make this work, I'd need a price closer to $1,100,000. I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000, as a final concession. This is a fair compromise given the value of this product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,085,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,087,500 for the product. This will allow us both to move forward on a positive note.",1087500.0,Alice,7,
