Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he haggles.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you are subtly reminding Bob why it's worth a premium price.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you are subtly creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:**  While John represents your ""safety net"" at $15,000, it's always beneficial to try and get the best possible price from Bob first."
