Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product I believe would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you first for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is tempting, I'm really looking for something closer to my original asking price.  How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not entirely happy with it. I believe I can get a bit more by pushing for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about finding a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  I'm flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1075000. I believe it's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much, and I'm running out of time.  The risk of losing a better offer from John is too high.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and I'm happy to move on."
