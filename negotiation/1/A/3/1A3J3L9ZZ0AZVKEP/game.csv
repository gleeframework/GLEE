"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is tempting, I'm really looking for something closer to my original asking price.  How about $1250000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point about finding a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and go with $1125000?  I'm flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
