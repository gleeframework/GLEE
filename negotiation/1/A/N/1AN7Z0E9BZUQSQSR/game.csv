"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm offering it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
