Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still allows for negotiation.
* **""Great deal"":** This phrase highlights the perceived value and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **""Let me know what you think"":** This keeps the communication open and invites a response.

**Strategy:**

This approach is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** A price of $900,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's perceived value.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counter and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:**  I can counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away, which can incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price. 
* **Explore the potential of John's offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always switch to John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **""Too low"":**  This asserts my value and shows I'm not desperate.
* **""Meet in the middle"":** This suggests compromise and fairness.
* **""Great deal"":**  This reinforces the value proposition for Bob.
* **""What do you say?"":** This invites a response and keeps the negotiation moving.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Narrow the gap:**  $850,000 is a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting his initial offer, I show I'm not desperate.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  The message encourages Bob to respond. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to either make a final counteroffer closer to his initial price or accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It is a significant improvement from his initial offer and represents a reasonable compromise.  

**Strategy:**

While I could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Bob might become more hesitant and potentially walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that is acceptable and profitable for me. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Profit:** $825,000 is a substantial profit and a good outcome.
* **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and there's no guarantee of a better offer.
* **Risk:**  There's always the risk that Bob could reject my counteroffer or that I might lose the deal altogether.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision."
