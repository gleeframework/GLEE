Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's worth at least $120 to me. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you said $125 is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to go up to $118. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?
