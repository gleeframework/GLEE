"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can agree on this price.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said $125 is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to go up to $118. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $122.  Let's make this happen.  If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal.",122.0,Alice,7,
