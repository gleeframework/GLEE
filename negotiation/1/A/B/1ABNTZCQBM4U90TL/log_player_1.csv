Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below what John is offering. This leaves room for negotiation, but also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make. I want to see if I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still well above his last offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving up on getting a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and while I could counteroffer again, it's unlikely he'll budge further. I've already lost some time negotiating with Bob, and John is guaranteed to give me my minimum. It's best to sell to John now to secure the guaranteed profit."
