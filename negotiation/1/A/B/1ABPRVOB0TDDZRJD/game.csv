"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $18000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $16500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $15750 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $16125. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",16125.0,Alice,5,
