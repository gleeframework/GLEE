"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is over his budget, and he can likely get a better price.  He's willing to go through some negotiation rounds before potentially buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still more than Bob wants to pay. He should try to get closer to his $15,000 goal.  He's willing to go through more negotiation rounds before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $16,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $15750 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $16125. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but she's still not willing to go below $16,000.  He's only got 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee she'll meet his price.  It's better to buy from John now and save himself the risk of further negotiation."
