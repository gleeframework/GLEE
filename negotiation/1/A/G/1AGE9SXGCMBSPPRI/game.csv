"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think this product is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,500 is still a little more than I'm able to spend right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $15,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, so the total value you'll get is $16,500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept $15,500 for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
