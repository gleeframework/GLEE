Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think this product is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, so the total value you'll get is $16,500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept $15,500 for the product.
