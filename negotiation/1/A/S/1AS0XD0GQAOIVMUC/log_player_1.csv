Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for the highest price Bob might accept, significantly exceeding your minimum ($8,000) and approaching his perceived value ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  The wording emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as advantageous to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation."
