# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110.**  This is more than the product is worth to you ($120).
* **Rejecting the offer:**  You can buy the product from John for $120, which is your maximum price.
* **Buying from John:** While this is your maximum price, it's still better than accepting Alice's offer."
