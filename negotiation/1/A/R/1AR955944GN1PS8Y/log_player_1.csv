Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $725,000.  This is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell for less. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below the product's value to you, and his mention of John selling ""for less"" is likely a bluff to pressure you. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum acceptable price, so it's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiating with Bob."
