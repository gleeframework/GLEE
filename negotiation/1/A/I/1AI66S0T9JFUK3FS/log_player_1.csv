{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $80, so you're not selling yourself short.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $100, so there's space for him to counteroffer. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A price closer to $100 might make Bob immediately reject it.

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to your minimum, it's still below what you are hoping for. You can likely negotiate a better price with Bob. You also have a backup buyer in John, so you're in a good position to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still not quite there. How about $87? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87 is close to your minimum, it's still below what you're hoping to get. You have John as a backup, and Bob is already close to your price, so you have leverage to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $87 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}
