Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing you a significant profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000. 

By setting the price at $11,999, you're aiming for the best-case scenario of Bob accepting, while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
