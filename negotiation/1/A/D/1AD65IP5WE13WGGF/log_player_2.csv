Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While it seems nice, $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. I can sell it to you for $135.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I can see that $105 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. How about we meet at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my limit."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $110, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $128 for the product. How about we meet at $128? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down significantly from $128. You've been clear about your $110 limit, and she's consistently aiming for a price above your threshold.  It's better to cut your losses and secure the product from John at $100."
