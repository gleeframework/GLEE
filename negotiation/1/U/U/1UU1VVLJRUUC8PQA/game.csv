"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000. Can you consider $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can conclude the deal at this price. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'm counteroffering at $1070000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can conclude the deal at this price. What do you think?",1070000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1200000.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
