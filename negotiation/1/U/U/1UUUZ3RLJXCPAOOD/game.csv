"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $2,000,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer and still within a reasonable range for me. Let's see if we can come to a final agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
