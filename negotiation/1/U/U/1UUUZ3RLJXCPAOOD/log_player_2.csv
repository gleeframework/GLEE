"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above your budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $2,000,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is still above your budget. It's worth pushing for a lower price. You're still better off than buying from John, as you could potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer and still within a reasonable range for me. Let's see if we can come to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,400,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John, as you're guaranteed to get the product within your price range.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of her rejecting your counteroffers, potentially leaving you with no product and a wasted effort."
