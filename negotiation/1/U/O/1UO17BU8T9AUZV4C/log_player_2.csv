"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe can be very valuable to your business. My initial price is $2,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,200,000? This price reflects the value and potential of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate the movement, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's potential and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair compromise.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm also considering another buyer who's willing to pay closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down in price, she's still significantly above your $800,000 limit. Her mentioning another buyer could be a negotiating tactic, but it also adds risk.  At this point, John's offer is more attractive as it guarantees you get the product without the uncertainty and potential for a higher final price with Alice."
