"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe can be very valuable to your business. My initial price is $2,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to budge. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm framing the offer in terms of the product's benefits for Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility to show I'm open to reaching a deal, but I'm also setting a strong initial position.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and use the threat of selling to John as leverage. I'll be willing to lower the price, but I want to see how far Bob is willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Leveraging John:** I have a better alternative in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.  This gives me strong leverage in negotiations.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price by countering. 

**Strategy:**

I'll use this round to counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll continue to leverage the threat of selling to John to encourage Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,200,000? This price reflects the value and potential of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Minimum:** I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,200,000, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and potential to justify the price.
* **Compromise Language:**  I'm using ""fair compromise"" to emphasize that I'm being flexible but not giving away the farm.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'll still be prepared to walk away if he doesn't meet me halfway. The threat of selling to John remains a powerful tool in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate the movement, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's potential and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Leveraging John:** I'm still better off selling to John at this point. 
* **Need More Leverage:** Bob's offer suggests he's unwilling to pay closer to my value. I need to continue negotiating or move on to John.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to reject Bob's offers and try to push him closer to my desired price. I'll need to find a way to make him see the value of the product closer to my perspective. However, I will be very cautious about going too low as I don't want to lose out on the deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair compromise.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm also considering another buyer who's willing to pay closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm lowering my price again, but staying above my minimum price.  $1,000,000 is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while still reflecting the product's value.
* **Threat of John:** I'm reminding Bob that I have another buyer, creating pressure to close the deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential benefits to Bob, reminding him of the long-term value it could bring.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground with Bob while maintaining a sense of urgency. I want to make him feel like he's getting a good deal while also emphasizing that I have other options.  This round is crucial for gauging Bob's willingness to compromise and making a final decision on whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
