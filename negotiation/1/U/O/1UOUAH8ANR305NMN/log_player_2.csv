It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $1,700,000. You can get it from John for $1,500,000. So, you should reject the offer and start counteroffering."

Alice's offer is still too high.  You can get the product from John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal.  You should reject her offer and try to get a lower price from her."
