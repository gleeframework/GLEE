"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. My asking price is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant value it holds for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob and we can still get a better price than $850,000.  It's worth trying to get closer to our desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $900,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's see if we can find common ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We are still within a reasonable range to try and get a better price than $875,000.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $890,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $880,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's better to secure this deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation breakdown, especially with only 4 rounds remaining."
