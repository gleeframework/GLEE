You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150 maximum.
* Alice is offering it for $120.
* You can get it from John for $150.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value. It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, saving yourself $30."
