Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to reach a more acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
