{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $11,500 is a good starting point, giving me a decent profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** By offering a price slightly lower than what Bob is willing to pay, I create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Be confident but not pushy:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, fostering a positive negotiation atmosphere. 

Remember, this is just my first offer. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response and the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
