"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. He has a significant buffer between Alice's offer and his own valuation of the product, and he should leverage that to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable accepting $750,000, as it's still below my minimum target. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000.
