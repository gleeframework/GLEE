"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is closer to what I need, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
