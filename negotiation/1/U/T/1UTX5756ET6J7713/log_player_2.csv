"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $100 for this exceptional item? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we set the price at $85 for the product? This is still above its value to me, but it's closer to what you're willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hesitant to go above my $80 limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with, especially since John is offering the product for $80."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not quite there. $85 is unfortunately a bit more than I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my maximum budget of $80. John is offering the same product for $80, which is within my budget. Since time is limited and I want to ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll go with John's offer."
