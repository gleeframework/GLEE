"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $100 for this exceptional item?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $100 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about we consider a price of $90 for the product? I believe it still reflects its value while being more accessible to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $75 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we set the price at $85 for the product? This is still above its value to me, but it's closer to what you're willing to pay.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not quite there. $85 is unfortunately a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my offer of $75 for the product.  I believe this is fair to both of us and allows us to make a deal.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to compromise further. How about we settle on $82 for the product? This is a price that respects its value while remaining within your budget.",82.0,Alice,7,
