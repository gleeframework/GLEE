"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit surprised by the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement, $800,000 undervalues the product's true worth. Let's meet closer to the middle ground â€“ I propose $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I think that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
