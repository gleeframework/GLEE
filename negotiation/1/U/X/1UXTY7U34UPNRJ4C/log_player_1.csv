This offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob will find it appealing, as he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than $12,000. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $12,500, and we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. It's time to finalize the deal with Bob."
