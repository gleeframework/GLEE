"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $115 is still too close to her valuation and leaves room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable bargaining range. It signals that I'm serious about buying but need a lower price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** By offering $90, I leave space for Alice to counter with a price closer to my $100 limit.
* **Alternative option in mind:** I'm aware that I can buy the product from John for $100, so I'm not desperate to accept any price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough to my limit:**  While I could try to haggle further, $105 is only $5 over my ideal price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or me spending too much time for a minimal gain.
* **Time value:** Sometimes a good deal is good enough.  Getting the product now for a reasonable price is preferable to endless negotiation."
