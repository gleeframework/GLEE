Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, it makes more financial sense to go with that option and save the extra $1,000."
