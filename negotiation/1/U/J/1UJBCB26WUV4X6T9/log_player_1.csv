Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob is interested in the product and will be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it at that price if I think I can get more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $175. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still getting a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $160 is a fair price and it's better than selling to John for $150.  It's also worth noting that continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale to Bob entirely."
