"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $500,000. I believe this offer represents a fair starting point considering the potential value I see in it. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response and for recognizing the value of this product.  While your initial offer is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to continue the conversation. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,700,000. I believe this price better reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,700,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we move closer to the middle and consider $800,000? This takes into account the value I place on the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
