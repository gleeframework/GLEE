Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $500,000. I believe this offer represents a fair starting point considering the potential value I see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response and for recognizing the value of this product.  While your initial offer is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to continue the conversation. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,700,000. I believe this price better reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,700,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we move closer to the middle and consider $800,000? This takes into account the value I place on the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his stated value of $800,000. While continued negotiation is possible, it's risky to keep going when you have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. Accepting John's offer is the most logical choice to ensure the best possible outcome."
