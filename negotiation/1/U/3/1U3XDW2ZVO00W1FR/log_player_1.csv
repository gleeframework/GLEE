"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal. I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation but still aiming for a price that is significantly higher than his valuation. This will hopefully encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $16,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum desired price. It's also a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still a little below what I want. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $14,500. This is a small concession, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. While $13,500 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I've made several concessions, but it seems like Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
