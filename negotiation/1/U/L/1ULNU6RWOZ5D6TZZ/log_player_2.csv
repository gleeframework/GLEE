"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer.  He has a clear advantage knowing Alice values the product at $10,000."

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. He'll try another counteroffer to see if he can bridge the gap."
