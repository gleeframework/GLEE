Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $100, and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as he values the product at $100. However, I'm prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While I am happy to sell the product for $100 to John, I will reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still above my minimum price of $100, and I believe this price is fair given that Bob values the product at $100."
