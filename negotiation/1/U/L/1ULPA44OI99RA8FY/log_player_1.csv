"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not unreasonable. This will give me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also leaving myself some breathing room for further counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to settle for the minimum. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's $1500 higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial asking price.  This shows flexibility while still trying to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm not sure if I can get any higher.  It's better than selling to John, and I'm getting closer to my target with each round.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
