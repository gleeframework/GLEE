Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price to John ($1,200,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob attempts to counter-offer) while still securing a significant profit above our guaranteed sale price.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as a limited-time opportunity can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the price without trying to negotiate down too much."
