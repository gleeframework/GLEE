Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a high offer close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leave Bob Feeling Good:** Offering a price slightly below his perceived value could make him feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $9,500 still provides a significant gain compared to John's offer of $8,000.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while maintaining a balance to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
