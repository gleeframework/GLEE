# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go below $8400. I think the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price. My counteroffer is $8400 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's been unable to get Alice's price down to his target of $8,000, and with only a few rounds left, there's a risk that the negotiation will continue to stall. It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his offers or continuing to hold out for a higher price."
