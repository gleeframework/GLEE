{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price, but it's still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it. If not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and it allows you to get a great deal on a product that's clearly worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,100,000. I'd like to make a new offer of $980,000. I'm willing to take a risk to get a good deal on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to risk losing a sale to John for a lower price.  I'll sell to John and secure a good profit."
