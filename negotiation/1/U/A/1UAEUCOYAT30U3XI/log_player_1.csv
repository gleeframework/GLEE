Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I can come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think this is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $11,000 is a significant profit compared to John's $8,000 offer."
