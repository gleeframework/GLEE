"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $112. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",112.0,Bob,4,
