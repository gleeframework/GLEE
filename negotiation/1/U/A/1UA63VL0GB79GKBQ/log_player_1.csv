Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny of my asking price of $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, aiming to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. This keeps the door open for potentially reaching an even higher final price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
