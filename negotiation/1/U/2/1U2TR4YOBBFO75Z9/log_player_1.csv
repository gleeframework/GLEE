Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than his estimated value of $1,200,000 to get the product. We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price above my minimum acceptable value. I believe Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, especially considering the potential for further negotiation if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going to be long and potentially fruitless. I'm comfortable selling to John for $1,500,000, which is a much quicker and more secure option."
