"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great price considering the product's value to me, and gives you a significant saving. Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
