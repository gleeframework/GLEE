We are getting close to the end of the negotiations and Bob seems to be stuck at $900,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. It's better to be safe than sorry and sell to John for $1,200,000, which is significantly closer to my desired price."
