Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $19,000. I believe in its value and think it could be highly beneficial for you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $12,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started lower. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high initial price gives you room to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob. This allows you to be firm in your pricing.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but does carry the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. You will need to assess Bob's personality and negotiation style to determine if this approach is appropriate."
