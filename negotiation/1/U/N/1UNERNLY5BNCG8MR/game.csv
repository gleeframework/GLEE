,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $950,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my target. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm offering $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. It's a slight increase, but I believe it's still a great value for you and a fair price for me.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still hoping to close this deal.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's work together to make this happen.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,075,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000, but I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,030,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
