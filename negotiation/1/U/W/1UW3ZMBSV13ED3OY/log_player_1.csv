Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** A price slightly under a round number like $20,000 can sometimes feel more appealing to buyers.

It's important to note: This strategy assumes you don't have significant costs associated with waiting for another buyer. If time is a factor, you might adjust your offer to ensure a quicker sale."
