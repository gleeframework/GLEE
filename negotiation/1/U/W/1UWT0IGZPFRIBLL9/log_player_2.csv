"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have an alternative option with John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or ultimately buy from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
