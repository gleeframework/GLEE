"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11000. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This feels like a fair price considering the value I place on it and the potential for us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $10000, which would be $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",10500.0,Alice,5,
