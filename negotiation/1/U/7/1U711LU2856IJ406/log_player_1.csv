Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting the bar high:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, starting high allows room for negotiation.  
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended (""open to hearing your thoughts"") to see how interested Bob is and if he might be willing to pay more than $8,000. 
* **No loss scenario:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can always fall back on John, our guaranteed buyer at $15,000. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing risk."
