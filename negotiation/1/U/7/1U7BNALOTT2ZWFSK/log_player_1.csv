Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable to your business. My price for it is $900,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic starting point. Here's why:

* **It's ambitious:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:** It demonstrates you believe in the product's worth.
* **It leaves space for compromise:** You can adjust if Bob makes a counteroffer.

This approach allows you to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the $900,000 I offered and far below the product's value to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option if I don't get a more reasonable price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This takes into account your perspective and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **It's a compromise:** It moves closer to Bob's offer but still remains above his perceived value.
* **It's reasonable:**  It shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my own financial goals.
* **It's firm:** It clearly states a price point, leaving less room for further drastic reductions.

This approach aims to find a middle ground and encourages Bob to consider a more equitable deal without jeopardizing my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's counteroffer is a slight improvement, $775,000 is still too far from my ideal price.  I'm determined to get closer to $850,000.  The potential for a deal with John at $1,000,000 remains my safety net, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a little longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about finding a middle ground. While $775,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway again, but not completely giving in.
* **Stay above my minimum:** $825,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Create pressure:** It emphasizes the need for a decision, suggesting that I might not be willing to negotiate further. 

This strategy aims to nudge Bob towards a more favorable deal for me without completely closing the door on a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $795,000 is closer to my preferred price, it's still not enough to meet my financial goals. I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiations might drag on without a guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.  To ensure a profitable deal, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
