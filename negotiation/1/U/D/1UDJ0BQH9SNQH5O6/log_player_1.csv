Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that's slightly below your guaranteed price with John. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business helps justify the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone is polite and leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer.  

**Why not lower?**

* Offering a price closer to $800,000 leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. Since we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, we are in a strong position to negotiate."
