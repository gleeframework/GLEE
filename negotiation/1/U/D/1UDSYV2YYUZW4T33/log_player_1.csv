"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high bar and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer down in subsequent rounds. However, if he accepts, I've made a great deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum target of $1,500,000. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is above my minimum target of $1,500,000, and it's getting closer to my ideal price.  Since I have limited rounds, I'm going to accept his offer and secure a good deal."
