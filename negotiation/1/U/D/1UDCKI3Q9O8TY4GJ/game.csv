"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? That's still a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",145.0,Alice,3,
