"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It's a significant decrease from Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation.  We're aiming to get the price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference and call it $9,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to nudge the price down further while still signaling a willingness to compromise. It splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's current offer, which can be a persuasive negotiating tactic."
