Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a strategic opening offer. It's a good starting point for negotiation as it:

* **Offers a significant discount:**  $10,000 is $2,000 less than what the product is worth to Bob, making it attractive.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You haven't gone too low, giving you space to adjust the price if necessary.
* **Shows confidence:** You're not afraid to ask for a good price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm choosing to counter with a price of $9,250. This offers a compromise: 

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** This ensures I'm getting at least $8,000 for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference and call it $9,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a fair compromise and meets my minimum price requirement.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
