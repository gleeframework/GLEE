"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and while I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the value it can bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I recognize its value, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still not comfortable accepting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can push a little further and get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for you.  $950,000 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
