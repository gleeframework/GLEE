Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the value it can bring to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for you.  $950,000 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has met her own valuation of the product. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing the negotiation risks missing out on the deal entirely.  It's best to accept now and secure a good price."
