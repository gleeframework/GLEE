Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you want to pay. You can likely still negotiate a lower price."
