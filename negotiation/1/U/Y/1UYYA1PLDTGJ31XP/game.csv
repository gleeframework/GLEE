"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $820000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know what you think.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your offer of $750000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm counteroffering at $790000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know what you think.",790000.0,Alice,5,
