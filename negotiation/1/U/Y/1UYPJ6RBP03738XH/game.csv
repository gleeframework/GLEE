"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than I had in mind, I understand there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer takes into account the true value and potential this product holds.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's a fair offer considering its value to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
