"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. How about we split the difference at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.  ",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. How about we settle on $90? That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. ",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $90. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's make this happen.",90.0,Alice,7,
