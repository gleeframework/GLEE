Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $95. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and positions it as a potential bargain compared to an unknown higher price later. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you aim for $95, starting slightly higher leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting you closer to your $100 goal.

This approach balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
