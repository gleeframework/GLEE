Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, there's no reason to go below that.  We start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification and Openness:** The message frames the price as related to the product's value and invites Bob's feedback, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer outright.  A different strategy could involve starting lower to entice Bob while still aiming to negotiate upwards."
