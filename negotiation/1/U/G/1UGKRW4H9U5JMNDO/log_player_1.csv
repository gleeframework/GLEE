Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Slight Markup:** A price of $135 represents a 12.5% markup from your minimum price. This is a reasonable starting point, and if Bob accepts, you'll earn a nice profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value and is phrased as a question, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer at $135. However, since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, you're not risking losing money. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit."
