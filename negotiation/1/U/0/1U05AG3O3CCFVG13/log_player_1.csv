{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $950,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you're not giving away too much.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've created a range for potential counteroffers, giving you flexibility in the negotiation. 

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to **reject** it and make a counteroffer. Here's why:

* **My minimum:**  My goal is to earn at least $1,000,000. Accepting $850,000 would fall short of that goal.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price.
* **The backup option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if I can't secure a better deal with Bob.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my target price while still keeping the negotiation open."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would give you a significant savings and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above my minimum:** $900,000 is still above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Be a compromise:** It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:** It's still higher than Bob's current offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

I'll see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to come down, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Here's why:

* **My minimum:**  While getting closer, $875,000 is still significantly below my minimum goal of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for compromise:** I believe there's still room for Bob to come up in price, and I'm not willing to accept a deal that far below my desired value.
* **The safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 remains a viable option if we can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

My counteroffer will be a small step towards Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also committed to securing a price that reflects the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** It's a significant step towards Bob's offer, indicating my desire to reach a deal.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $887,500 is still above my minimum target of $1,000,000.  
* **Create urgency:** By suggesting a compromise and emphasizing ""making the deal happen"", I aim to encourage Bob to accept before he considers walking away. 

I'll see if this final offer is enough to secure the deal with Bob. If not, I'll be ready to sell to John and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is it. Bob's last offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I've shown flexibility, made concessions, and demonstrated a desire to reach an agreement. But ultimately, Bob's stubbornness and unwillingness to meet my needs make this negotiation unproductive. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to **sell the product to John for $1,000,000**. This guarantees me a fair price and allows me to move on without further wasted time and effort."
