,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product is incredibly valuable and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in buying, but my absolute maximum is $12,000.  Is that something you could consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  Would you be willing to do $14,500? That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
