Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,300,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's valuation, there's no harm in starting with a strong offer closer to our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason, even if general, makes the offer seem more considered. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering at $1,300,000 gives Bob a potential $500,000 gain if he values it even slightly higher than $800,000.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept."
