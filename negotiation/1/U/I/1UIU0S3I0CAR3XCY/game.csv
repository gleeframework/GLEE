"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me. While I do believe the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
