Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high initially, as Bob values the product significantly more than your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $11,000 offer allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **Consider the Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000, so any offer above that is a gain. This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit from Bob, the higher-value customer."
