"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $12,500 is better than $15,000, it's still above his desired price.  He should reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your need for a fair price, Alice.  $11,500 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's still a good deal for you, and gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $12000, which would be $11750. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $11,750 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $10,000, and significantly better than John's $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob might be able to squeeze out another small discount, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential gains. 
* **Time Factor:** Continued negotiation could drag on and cost Bob valuable time.

Accepting the offer secures a good deal without risking losing out to John."
