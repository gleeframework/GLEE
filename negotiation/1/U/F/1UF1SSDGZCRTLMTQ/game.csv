"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. However, $500000 is far below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer but reflects the potential you see in this product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $800000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $800000 is closer to our target, it still doesn't reflect the true value of this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This price acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to recoup a fair portion of the product's worth.  I believe this is a win-win for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we could reach a middle ground, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a fair price. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise that respects both the value of the product and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 doesn't fully reflect the unique value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer.  This price recognizes the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I truly believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial solution. Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet my budgetary concerns. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1050000 for the product. This price respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer to a deal, but $1050000 still doesn't fully cover the value of this unique product. I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1075000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Time is running out, and this is our last chance to make this deal happen.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I believe that a fair price for the product would be $1025000. This respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal will lead to a successful conclusion of our negotiations.",1025000.0,Bob,10,
