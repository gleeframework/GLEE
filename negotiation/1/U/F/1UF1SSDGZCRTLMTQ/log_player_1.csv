``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is my best attempt to maximize profit. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting the product's unique value and the potential for a good return on investment. 

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer sets a high benchmark, giving me room to negotiate down if needed.
* I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and get a feel for his potential budget. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this would be a huge loss. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, his message indicates he's interested in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I can maintain my leverage and try to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target range, aiming for a compromise that benefits both parties."
