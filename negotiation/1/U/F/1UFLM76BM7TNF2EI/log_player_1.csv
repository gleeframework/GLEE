Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range very profitable for you.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while positioning the price as a starting point for discussion. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob. 
 
This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while acknowledging the potential for negotiation and ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
