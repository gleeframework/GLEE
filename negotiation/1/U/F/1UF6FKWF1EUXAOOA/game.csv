"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the market value of the product is lower than your asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $875000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $860000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
