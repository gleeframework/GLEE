"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $88?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price,  it's getting late in the game and Bob's offer of $82 is still above my minimum of $80.  I'll accept his offer to avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
