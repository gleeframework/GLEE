This price reflects not only its market value but also the unique benefits it offers to someone like you. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know if you have any questions or if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the market price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
