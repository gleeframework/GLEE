"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $115 is getting closer. How about we split the difference and do $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $111.25.  That's a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",111.25,Alice,5,
