"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, you can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You have nothing to lose by trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, you want to offer a price that's just slightly higher.  $10,500 is a good starting point for your counteroffer. It gives Alice some room to negotiate but also demonstrates your commitment to getting a better price than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $11,000, which is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes the most sense to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John. There's no guarantee you'll be able to get a lower price from Alice, and you risk wasting time in further negotiation."
