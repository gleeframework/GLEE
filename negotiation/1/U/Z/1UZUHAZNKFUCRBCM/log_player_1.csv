"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:** My message expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, hoping to build trust and encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Early Exit:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move to John as I'm still confident I can get my minimum value from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, there's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Power:**  I have 8 rounds left, and selling to John remains a viable option if I don't get a better offer from Bob. This gives me leverage to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility while preserving my negotiation position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's true value. How about $1,050,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant advantage. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. It demonstrates flexibility while showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Value Justification:**  I emphasize the ""true value"" of the product to justify my counteroffer, further appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and cooperative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiations in the remaining rounds, while still guaranteeing a profit greater than what John offers."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 6 rounds left, which is enough time to continue negotiating. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, providing a safety net and negotiation leverage.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's get this deal finalized!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a further compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I reiterate the idea of ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to see the value in accepting the offer.
* **Urgency:** I introduce a sense of urgency by saying ""let's get this deal finalized."" This aims to motivate Bob to reach a decision and avoid losing the opportunity. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  While lower than my previous offers, this price still secures a profit for me, leaving a buffer if further negotiation is necessary.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 5 rounds left, I'm still confident that I can secure a better price than what John offers if necessary."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but there's still a gap of $25,000.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 4 rounds left, which is enough to keep negotiating. 
* **John's Offer:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, which provides a safe option and negotiation leverage.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but staying above my minimum acceptable value. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a favorable outcome for me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000. This will give us both a good deal and we can finally close this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer is my final offer and aligns with my minimum acceptable value. It closes the gap and should be appealing to Bob as it meets his budget while providing me with my desired outcome.
* **Urgency & Finality:** I emphasize ""finalizing the transaction"" to create a sense of urgency and convey that this is my final offer.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I frame the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us to highlight the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement.
* **Pressure Point:**  With only 3 rounds left, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept the offer before he risks losing out on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to offer $980,000, which is as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are down to our last two rounds. This means any further negotiations with Bob are risky, especially given his history of rejecting offers close to my desired price.
* **Profit vs. Risk:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. The risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending with a lower price is too high.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $1,000,000. There's no risk involved, and it's the most secure way to achieve my goal in this scenario. 

While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, the time pressure and Bob's unwillingness to meet my minimum make selling to John the best strategic decision at this point."
