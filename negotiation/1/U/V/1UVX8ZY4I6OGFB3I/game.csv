"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
