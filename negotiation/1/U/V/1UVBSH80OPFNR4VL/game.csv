"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a significant investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would still give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to wait for the right price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while keeping me within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I know the product has. I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000, but I think we can do better than that. Let's see if we can push the price up a bit higher.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,320,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm prepared to go up to $1,310,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while keeping me within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I think $1,310,000 is still a bit short of the product's value, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that if we can't meet at this price, it might be better to explore other options. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $1,315,000, but I'm really pushing my budget here. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1315000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,315,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,315,000 and $1,325,000, which would be $1,320,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If we can't agree on this price, I'm starting to think that I should explore other options. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",1320000.0,Alice,9,
