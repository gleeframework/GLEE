"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a significant investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is higher than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000).  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would still give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to wait for the right price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000). You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option. You're still early in the negotiation, and there's potential to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while keeping me within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I know the product has. I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000, but I think we can do better than that. Let's see if we can push the price up a bit higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still higher than your budget, but it's getting closer. You've shown that you're willing to negotiate and move closer to her asking price. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,320,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm prepared to go up to $1,310,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while keeping me within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1310000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I think $1,310,000 is still a bit short of the product's value, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that if we can't meet at this price, it might be better to explore other options. Let's see if we can make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still higher than your budget, but you're getting very close. You have a few rounds left and there's potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $1,315,000, but I'm really pushing my budget here. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1315000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,315,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,315,000 and $1,325,000, which would be $1,320,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If we can't agree on this price, I'm starting to think that I should explore other options. Let's see if we can make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have only one round left. You've tried your best to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is unwilling to go below $1,320,000. This price is still higher than your budget, and with only one round left, it's unlikely you'll be able to secure a better deal. To avoid further delays and ensure you get the product, it's best to buy it from John for $1,500,000.  Even though it's higher than your ideal price, it's still within your budget and you'll avoid further negotiation with Alice."
