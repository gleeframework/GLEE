"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $950,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers a fair value for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for your business, and I'm eager to see us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your continued interest in this product. While $1,050,000 is closer to our target, it's still slightly below what I need to make this deal work.  To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product for your business. I'm confident we can finalize this deal and ensure a successful partnership. ",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,150,000 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
