"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $12,250. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While the product is valuable, my budget is firm. How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is your firm budget, but I'm still a bit short on my desired price. I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product to you for $12,750. It's the lowest I can go while still making a profit.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,750 is still too high for me. I can do $11,500, which is a fair compromise considering your last offer. If you're not able to accept this, I might have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $12,600. It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but $12,600 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer a final price of $11,750.  If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to consider purchasing from John, even though I'd prefer to work with you.",11750.0,Bob,8,
