"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product for a one-time price of $12,000. It's a steal at twice the market value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way out of my budget. This product is only worth $6,000 to me. Would you consider that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $7,500? That's the highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we compromise at $8,500? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make it a one-time deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
