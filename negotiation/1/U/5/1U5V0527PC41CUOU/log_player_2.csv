"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product for a one-time price of $12,000. It's a steal at twice the market value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way out of my budget. This product is only worth $6,000 to me. Would you consider that?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This gives you room to move upwards during the bargaining process.
* **Signaling Interest:** While the offer is low, it shows Alice you're interested in the product but need a significantly lower price. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering $6,000, there's space for Alice to counter and potentially meet somewhere closer to your $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your limit, but you can still try to negotiate a better price. $9,000 is still above your ideal budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $7,500? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** We're moving closer to your $8,000 maximum in smaller increments, showing willingness to compromise but not to be walked over.
* **Setting a Firm Limit:** By stating ""$7,500 is the highest I can go,"" you're signaling to Alice that you're serious about your budget constraints. This could encourage her to make a final decision. 
* **Maintaining Room to Negotiate (Slightly):** There's still a small gap between $7,500 and your $8,000 absolute maximum, allowing for a tiny bit of wiggle room if Alice is very resistant."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we compromise at $8,500? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make it a one-time deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  You've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in significant savings. Buying from John at $8,000 ensures you stay within your budget and avoid potentially lengthy back-and-forth."
