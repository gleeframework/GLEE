"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can do better than $9,000.  You should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $8,750? It's a compromise that's closer to my value and gives you a fair price.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's best to accept that deal."
