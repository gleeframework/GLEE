"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $8,750? It's a compromise that's closer to my value and gives you a fair price.  Let me know if that works for you.",8750.0,Alice,3,
