"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. How about $750,000?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are still significantly above John's offer. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate Bob a bit higher, even if it's just a small concession."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By stating this is my final offer, it adds a bit of pressure to the negotiation. We are giving a concession, but still maintaining a price point well above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $885,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has increased his offer and we are in a strong position. While we could potentially squeeze a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away and losing the deal is greater than the potential reward of a slightly higher offer.  Taking the $885,000 is a good outcome."
