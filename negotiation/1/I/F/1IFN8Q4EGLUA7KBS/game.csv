"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $12,800 is still a little steep for me. Could we settle somewhere around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,200 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,850?",11850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm getting close to my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,050. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12050.0,Alice,7,
