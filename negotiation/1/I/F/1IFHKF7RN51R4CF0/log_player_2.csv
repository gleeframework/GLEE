"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and she's starting at $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above your maximum.  You're better off trying to negotiate further.  There are still 7 rounds left, and you can always go with John's offer if you don't reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $875,000. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, you're still $100,000 apart. There are still six rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price. You can always go with John's offer if you don't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about wanting a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $885,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 885000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $885,000. I'm counteroffering at $912,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you in the middle. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we are down to our last three rounds.  While there's a chance we could negotiate further, the risk of not reaching a deal is increasing. It's wiser to secure the product from John at $800,000. It's your maximum price, and you're guaranteed to get the product."
