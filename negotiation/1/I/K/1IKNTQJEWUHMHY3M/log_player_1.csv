Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $14,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Option to Walk Away:**  By mentioning John, Bob is subtly reminded that you have other options, adding pressure. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:** The $14,000 offer leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer that you can either accept or reject.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,500 is still significantly lower than the minimum value you've set for yourself ($15,000). Accepting it would mean a loss.
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it's not unreasonable.  This indicates he's willing to negotiate further, which gives you leverage.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, there's still potential to earn more by negotiating with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control and can make a counteroffer that might be more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Above Bob's Offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but won't accept a price far below your minimum.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $13,250 is the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value, subtly suggesting he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly, encouraging further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise while still ensuring you get a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $12,750? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is slightly higher, it's still well below your minimum value.  You're not likely to get a better offer from Bob, and continuing the negotiation might just waste time.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum desired price of $15,000.  This is a safe and profitable option.

The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers are unlikely to result in a price you're happy with. It's time to take the guaranteed profit from John."
