"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $12,750? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this.",12750.0,Bob,4,
