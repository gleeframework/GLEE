"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product within my budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think you'll really get a great deal at that price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we try $148? It's a small premium, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.",148.0,Alice,7,
