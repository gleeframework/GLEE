"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $132.50?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",130.0,Bob,4,
