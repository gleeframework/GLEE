"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll gain.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,750,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects its full potential. How about we settle on $2,000,000? This feels like a win-win, allowing you to capitalize on the product while ensuring a fair return on my end.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1,750,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the market demand and the product's value.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you the first opportunity. If you're able to come up to $1,900,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I need to explore that other option.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,800,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
