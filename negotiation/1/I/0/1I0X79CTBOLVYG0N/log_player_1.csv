Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  This product would be useful to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still too high for me. Perhaps we can find a price that works for both of us? How about $7,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial and $7,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget.  I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's my absolute limit.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's clear Bob is not going to budge significantly from his budget. Accepting his offer of $7,500 would be a substantial loss. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
