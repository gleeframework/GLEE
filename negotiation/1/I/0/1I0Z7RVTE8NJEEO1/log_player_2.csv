(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  A $100,000 saving is significant, and there are still 9 rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge. A $100,000 reduction is a significant amount, but it's still within the range of a possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about a deal but still pushing for a good price. This should encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is a good price considering the initial asking price and the fact that we have only 5 rounds left. While I'd like to get it even lower, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
