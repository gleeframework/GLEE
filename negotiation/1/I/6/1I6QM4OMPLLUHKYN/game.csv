"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
