"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that aligns perfectly with your needs.  While its true value is substantial, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount for a product that could easily fetch much more. I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial, allowing you a great deal while ensuring I still receive a reasonable return. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
