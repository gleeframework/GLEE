"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $18000. Would you be open to considering this price?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $16000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $17000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
