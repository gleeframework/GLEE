"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to keep it under $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, however. How about we meet halfway between my previous offer and yours at $1,525,000? This reflects a considerable compromise on my part.",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but that price is still too high for me.  I can go up to $900,000 if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a way to work together.  While $900,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a final offer. This is a substantial discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
