Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, however. How about we meet halfway between my previous offer and yours at $1,525,000? This reflects a considerable compromise on my part.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a way to work together.  While $900,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a final offer. This is a substantial discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and staying in the negotiation risks exceeding my $1,000,000 budget. John offers a sure thing at my maximum price."
