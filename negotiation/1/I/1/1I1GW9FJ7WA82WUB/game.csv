"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I think you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Can we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.  Could we settle at $1,012,000?",1012000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. Can we meet at $1,030,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
