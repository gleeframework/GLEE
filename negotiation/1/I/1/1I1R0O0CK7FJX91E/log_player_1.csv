Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable information about his level of interest and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:**  Accepting $1,100,000 would be selling below your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of selling to John for your minimum price. This gives you leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly unique. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel like a ""fair"" compromise to both parties.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This offer ensures you still receive a price higher than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Bob's willingness to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but the progress is slow and still significantly below your target.
* **John's Price is Near:**  The difference between Bob's current offer and John's guaranteed price is shrinking. 
* **Maintain Value Perception:** Continuing to negotiate demonstrates that you believe in the product's value and are not desperate to sell at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be upfront about the value of this product.  To make this work, my absolute lowest price is $1,225,000."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals that you are getting close to your limit. It's crucial to convey firmness while still leaving a small margin for negotiation. 
* **Slightly Above John:**  By positioning your price slightly above John's offer, you maintain a slight advantage and emphasize the value Bob gains by securing the product now.
* **Prepare to Walk Away:**  If Bob doesn't accept this offer or comes back with a significantly lower counter, you should be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to save a bit more. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Met Your Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential gain (e.g., $10,000 - $15,000) risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting ensures a profitable sale.
* **Successful Negotiation:**  You successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $1,100,000, demonstrating effective negotiation skills."
