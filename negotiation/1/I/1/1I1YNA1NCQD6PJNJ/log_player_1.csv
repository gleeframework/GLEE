"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a good incentive to accept the offer, as he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105.  This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but still ensures I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to run out of rounds, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm getting close to the end of negotiations, but I'm still holding out for a price above $100.  I'm offering $102, hoping to close the deal while still earning something above my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is not budging much. I've already rejected several offers below my minimum price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm confident I can secure a better deal than $98 with John.  I'll sell the product to John for $100."
