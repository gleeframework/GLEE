Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $990,000."", ""product_price"": 990000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High but Negotiable:** Starting at $990,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still likely settle for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Exclusivity Tactic:** Emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept."
