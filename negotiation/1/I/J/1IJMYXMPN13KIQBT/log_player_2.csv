# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I would like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $80 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $100.
