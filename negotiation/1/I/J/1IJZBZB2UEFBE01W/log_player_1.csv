"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point and leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a strong position while also showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. How about $800,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to settle for it right away. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. Would $850,000 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and I've already had several rounds of negotiation.  It's better to secure the sale now than to risk getting a lower offer or a rejection in the next rounds."
