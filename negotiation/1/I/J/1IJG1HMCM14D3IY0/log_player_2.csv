(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is way over your budget of $80.  You're better off rejecting and counter-offering to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $80 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget of $80.  You can continue to negotiate with Alice, trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90. This is my best offer, so let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $100 is still outside your budget. You have 5 rounds left, but there's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further. It's wiser to go with John's offer of $80 and secure the product within your budget."
