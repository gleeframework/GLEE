"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This would still leave you with a profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
