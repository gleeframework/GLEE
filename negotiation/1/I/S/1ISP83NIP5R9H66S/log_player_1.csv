Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just rejecting outright.
* **Room for compromise:**  The $10,000 offer allows for a potential compromise without risking a complete breakdown of negotiations. 
* **The backup plan:** I can always go to John for my minimum price if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than you think. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I still have room to negotiate and can potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  If negotiations with Bob completely break down, I can always sell to John for my minimum price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and can try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. Let's split the difference and make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not going to accept Bob's low offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price. 
* **Highlighting a middle ground:**  The $9,500 counteroffer is a clear middle ground between our initial positions. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

By counteroffering, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to sell for a price significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a good chance Bob will just walk away.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him entirely and then being forced to sell to John for $12,000.

Accepting Bob's offer at $9,000 is the best course of action at this point. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
