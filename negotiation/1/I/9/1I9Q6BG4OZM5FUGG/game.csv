"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go over $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still above my limit. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a decent profit.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
