"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $75? That's the highest I can go.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $75, which would be $78.50. That's the best I can do.",78.5,Alice,5,
