"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, you can potentially get a better deal. It's always worth exploring other options and seeing if you can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be happy to buy the product for $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $9,000 to $8,750. This is a good deal for you, as you are willing to pay up to $10,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in smaller price drops, and you risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a good price."
