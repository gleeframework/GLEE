Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'll keep an eye on his counteroffer, and if he seems unwilling to budge, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $12,000, Bob seems unwilling to negotiate much higher. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum threshold, so I'll take that option to avoid further negotiation."
