The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob. This means there is room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer allows for a potential better price."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice's offer is still a bit too high for me. While it shows her willingness to compromise, I'm only willing to pay up to $900,000. It's better for me to buy the product from John for $800,000 and save $112,500."
