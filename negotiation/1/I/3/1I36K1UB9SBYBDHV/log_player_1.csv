Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can get close to my desired price. If Bob rejects, I'll counter-offer. If the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer. Accepting it would be a big loss for me.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $925,000? It's a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. 
* **Still above minimum:** $925,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving me some room for further negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise and keeping the communication positive, I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully secure a price closer to my target. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider my options and potentially make another counteroffer or accept his offer if it's closer to my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? It's a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly below.  Accepting it would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to my desired price. I believe there is still potential for a better deal.
* **John as a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, potentially aiming for a price slightly higher than $900,000, but still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll keep the negotiation moving forward while remaining mindful of my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll offer you the product for $912,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our willingness to compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate further.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $912,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Urging finality:**  I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to subtly pressure Bob into accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a small compromise, I'm hoping to entice Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward while staying firm on my minimum acceptable price."
