"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to consider her offer as it's below the product's worth to her, it's still too high for you. You should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget of $1,000,000. You can still save money by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before you consider buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still slightly above your budget of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely you'll be stuck in a cycle of small concessions. 

It's more advantageous to go with John's offer of $1,000,000 as it guarantees you the product at your maximum budget and avoids further haggling."
