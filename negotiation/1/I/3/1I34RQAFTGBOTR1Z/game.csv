"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $850000. This price reflects its true value and still allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still above my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $750000 for the product. This price is a fair middle ground, and it's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
