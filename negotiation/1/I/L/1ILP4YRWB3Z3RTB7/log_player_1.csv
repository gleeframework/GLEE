Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, aiming slightly below your true value ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a better deal.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for Bob to consider the offer (""very valuable to you"") and frames it as a good deal (""very competitive price""). 
* **Leaving Room:**  If Bob rejects the $14,500, you haven't gone so low that you can't offer a slightly reduced price (e.g., $14,000) in a follow-up before going to John."
