You should reject Alice's offer. $95 is still a decent price, but you have room to negotiate lower and potentially save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, and it's still within my budget. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$90 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll reject and see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $87. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$92 is still a bit higher than I want to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $89.  This is a small increase, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway but still aiming for a price below $90."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating for a while now, and while Alice is coming down, she's not getting close to my ideal price. At this point, with only a few rounds left, it's probably best to cut my losses and buy from John for $120. It's not my ideal price, but it's still within my budget and ensures I get the product."
