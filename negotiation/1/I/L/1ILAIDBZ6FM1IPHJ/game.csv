"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, or if you'd like to discuss further!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle on $11,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
