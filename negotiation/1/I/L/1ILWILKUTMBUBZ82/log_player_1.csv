Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my asking price.  $1,600,000 is still too low, and I have a good chance of getting a better price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,675,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find a way to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.
