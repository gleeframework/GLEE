It's always a good idea to start by seeing if you can negotiate a lower price.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential for savings."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how Alice reacts.  $800,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and it sets the tone for serious negotiation."

While I'd love to get it even lower, $870,000 is a good deal and close to my target.  With only 3 rounds left, it's not worth risking the deal with John."
