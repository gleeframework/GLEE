"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in buying it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($120)** is better than buying from John ($150). 
* However, you can likely get a better deal. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so you have room to negotiate. 
* Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer or wait for a better price from Alice."
