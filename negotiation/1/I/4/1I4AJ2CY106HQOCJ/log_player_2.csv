"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  To kick off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $15,000. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
