"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  To kick off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
