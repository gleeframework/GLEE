"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that reflects its value and your potential gain. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This gives you a solid profit margin while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Consider it, and let me know your decision.  ",900000.0,Alice,1,
