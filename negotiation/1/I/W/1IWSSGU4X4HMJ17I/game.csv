,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
