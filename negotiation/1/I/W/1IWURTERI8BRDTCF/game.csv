"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm really only able to spend $85 at this time.  Would you be willing to go down to that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $100. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really only able to spend $90 at this time.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, which would be $95. It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
