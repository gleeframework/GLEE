"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000, and I'm hoping I can get a better price from Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob as it's below my initial offer of $15,000. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable.  I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum value of $12,000. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to negotiate further and risk getting a worse offer or no offer at all.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum value and ensures a sale."
