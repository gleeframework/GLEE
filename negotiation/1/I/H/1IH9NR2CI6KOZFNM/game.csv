"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
