"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I really need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $152? It's still a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",152.0,Alice,5,
