"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your interest in selling this product to me. However, $850000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $780000.  What do you think?",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the value of the product, while also being reasonable for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $820000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a fair price considering what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
