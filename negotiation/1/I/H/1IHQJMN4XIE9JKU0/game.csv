"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product might be valuable to me, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1500000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1750000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find common ground. However, I must respectfully decline at $1750000. Given my current financial situation, I cannot meet that price. I am willing to offer $1600000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
