"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still slightly above my budget. Since I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before making a final decision."
