{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm also phrasing the message in a friendly and collaborative way, hoping to encourage a productive dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $800,000, as this is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirements."
