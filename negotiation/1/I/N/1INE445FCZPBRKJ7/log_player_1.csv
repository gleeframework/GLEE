Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I need to get at least $150, starting high gives room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Appeal to Bob:**  Framing it as a special opportunity might make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $120 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's a tempting discount from a higher implied price. This increases the chance Bob might accept, netting a better profit than selling to John."
