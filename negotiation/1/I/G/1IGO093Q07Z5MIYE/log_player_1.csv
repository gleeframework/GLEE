Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $90, knowing the product is worth $100 to me and $80 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message might make Bob more likely to engage and consider the offer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Floor:** $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** I believe I can likely negotiate a higher price with Bob, given his interest. 
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** However, if I fail to reach an agreement with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's a great deal for you, and I think it's fair to both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Within My Range:** $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not too much.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the value for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I again encourage Bob to continue the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about $82? That's my absolute maximum, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $82 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's likely the best I can get from Bob at this point.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a high chance he will walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for $100.
* **Time is a Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out and potentially lead to a lower price or no deal at all. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and is a decent outcome."
