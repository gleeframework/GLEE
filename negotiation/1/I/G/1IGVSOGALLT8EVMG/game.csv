"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your new offer. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $12,250? That way we both get a good deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000, and we can call it a day?",12000.0,Bob,6,
