"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($800,000 vs. $1,200,000). There's definitely room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $800,000 feels a bit low given its value. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to part with the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I still think there's room for negotiation.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to her, and $950,000 is still a significant profit. I'm going to counter again to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. I'm offering the product to you for $987,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $987,500 is very close to my target price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go lower, and I risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, saving me $212,500 compared to buying from John."
