Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $800,000 feels a bit low given its value. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.
