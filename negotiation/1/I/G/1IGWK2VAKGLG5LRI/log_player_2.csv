"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe you'll really value at $15,000. I'm willing to make a one-time deal with you at a price of $12,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
