"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95?  It's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counter-offer of $95 is within your budget of $120 and represents a good compromise.  It's still a better price than buying from John, so accepting the offer is the most beneficial choice."
