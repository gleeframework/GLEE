"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower to avoid losing the sale."
