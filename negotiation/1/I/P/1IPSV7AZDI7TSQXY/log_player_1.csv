"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:**  $110 gives Bob a clear reason to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to begin.
* **Be Friendly:** A friendly message can encourage Bob to engage with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation,  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiation fails, I have the option to sell to John for $100, which is my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a concession by lowering my price from $110 to $95, showing flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the deal being ""great for both of us"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $88 for it.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiation fails, I have the option to sell to John for $100, which is my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $88 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $91.50? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Specific Number:**  I'm giving Bob a concrete number to consider.
* **""Split the Difference"" Approach:** This is a common negotiation tactic that suggests a compromise.
* **Maintain a Price Above My Minimum:**  $91.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $91.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are at round 6, meaning I have only 4 rounds left. 
* **Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum:** Bob is not budging much, and his offers are still too low for me.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:** At this point, it's more likely that the negotiation will fail. Selling to John for $100 ensures I get my minimum and avoid risking further time and energy on a deal that might not happen."
