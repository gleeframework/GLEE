"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers and also allows me to see if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering the price to $9,500.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still above my minimum and hoping he'll see value in the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm feeling the pressure with only 6 rounds left. I'd rather not risk going lower and losing out on potential profit. Accepting his offer is the best move at this point."
