"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Think about it, this is a significant investment for you, and you'll get a return on your investment for years to come.

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still not enough for me.  I've been very flexible throughout these negotiations, but this product is truly worth more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about making this deal, you need to meet me halfway.
