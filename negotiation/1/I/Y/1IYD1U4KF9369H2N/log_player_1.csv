Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my valuation, the difference between his offer ($900,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000) is too significant to ignore. It's unlikely Bob will reach my minimum acceptable price, so it's more profitable to sell to John."
