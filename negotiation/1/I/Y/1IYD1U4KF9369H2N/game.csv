"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
