Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) while staying above your minimum ($120). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message is firm, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer. He might be willing to go slightly above $100 if he really wants the product.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John provides leverage. You are not desperate to sell below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between potentially securing a higher sale price from Bob and ensuring you don't miss out on a guaranteed profit from John."
