Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($800,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher price than Bob's valuation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" and positions the offer as a ""fair deal,"" aiming to persuade Bob. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price point and the guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000."
