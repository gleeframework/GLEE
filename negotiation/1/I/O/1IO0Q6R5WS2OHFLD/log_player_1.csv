I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I know it's worth less to him, I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay my price. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's no pressure to lower my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum. While I'd like to sell the product,  I'm not willing to go below $12,000 at this point. I will counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. I hope Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I will have to consider my options more seriously."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge on his offer and I'm not willing to go below $11,500.  I've already had a good back-and-forth with Bob and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000."
