"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum.  I'm hoping to get a good deal without having to negotiate too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to get a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to get closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $130, it's likely that Bob will not go higher.  I'd rather sell to Bob now than risk further negotiations and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
