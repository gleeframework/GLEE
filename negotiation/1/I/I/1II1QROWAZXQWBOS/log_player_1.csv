"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $8000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14000 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  That's a significant drop from your previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product. Let's find a compromise at this price. It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $12000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. If you're serious about selling, this might be the best deal we can reach.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, $11,000 is still below my minimum. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  I'm willing to go down to $11,500 for this product. This is a good price for you and a fair deal for me.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a little out of my reach.  I'm firm on $11000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on $11,000, which is still below my minimum. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely that I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
