"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $8000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  This still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14000 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  That's a significant drop from your previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $12000 for this product. Let's find a compromise at this price. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $12000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. If you're serious about selling, this might be the best deal we can reach. ",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  I'm willing to go down to $11500 for this product. This is a good price for you and a fair deal for me.  Let's close this deal!",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is still a little out of my reach.  I'm firm on $11000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while now.",11000.0,Bob,8,
