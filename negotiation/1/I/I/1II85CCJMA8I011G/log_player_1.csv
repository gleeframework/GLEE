Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's a bit below Bob's estimated value, but still leaves me with a good profit margin.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. It's still a good price for Bob, since he values it at $150, and it's closer to my initial asking price. I hope this will be agreeable to him, but I'm ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close enough to my initial counteroffer of $130. Accepting his offer is a good choice, as it ensures a profit of $25, which is better than selling to John for $100. Further negotiation might yield a better price, but there's a risk of losing the deal entirely."
