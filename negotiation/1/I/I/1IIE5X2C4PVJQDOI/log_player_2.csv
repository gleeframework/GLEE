"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a bit high. You know you have a backup option with John for $12,000, so there's a chance you can get a better price from Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
