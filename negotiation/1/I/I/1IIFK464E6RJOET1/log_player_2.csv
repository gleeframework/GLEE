"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, so there's time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $80, but leaving some room for negotiation. This offer shows Bob is serious about buying but also willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $92. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate further.  He's aiming for a price closer to his target of $85, and there are still 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm happy to pay $88. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this time he's offered a price that's closer to Alice's last counteroffer. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and wants to reach a compromise.  He's also emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $90. It's the lowest I can go, but I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is getting close to his maximum price ($120).  Accepting Alice's offer at $90 is still a good deal for Bob, especially considering he has only 5 rounds left.  There is a risk that Alice may reject further counteroffers and Bob would end up buying from John at a higher price."
