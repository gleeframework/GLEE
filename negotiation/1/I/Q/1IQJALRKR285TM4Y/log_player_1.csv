{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation and potential for you to get closer to that price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects this price, you can still negotiate further without giving away too much. 

Remember, this is just a starting point. You can adjust the price based on how Bob responds and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below the price you initially offered. You have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you can explore other options and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** It demonstrates your flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Still leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still go lower, but hopefully this will incentivize him to come closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $8200? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is just above your minimum, it's still closer to your floor price than the price you're aiming for.  You're very close to a deal with John, which gives you the power to be more assertive in this negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show firmness:**  Demonstrate that you're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Potentially push Bob higher:**  A counteroffer from you might encourage Bob to come up a bit.
* **Leave the option to sell to John:** You always have the alternative of selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $8,200 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $8,700.  This is a final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows firmness:**  It signals that you are not willing to go much lower.
* **Positions you for a close:** It's a compromise, but it's closer to your desired price.
* **Leaves no room for further negotiation:**  It's a final offer, which could push Bob to make a decision.

Remember, you can still sell to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your desired price, and you've already made a final offer that he rejected. This indicates a stalemate in the negotiation, and further counteroffers are unlikely to yield a better result.  Since John is willing to buy the product for $8,000, it's more beneficial to secure that guaranteed sale than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
