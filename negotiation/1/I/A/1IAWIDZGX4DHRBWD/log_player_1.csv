Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $15,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and leaves me with a decent profit. It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and continuing negotiations might lead to a lower final price."
