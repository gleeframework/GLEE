Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum price of $12,000, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** A higher initial offer demonstrates your willingness to make a deal. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest while still leaving room for counteroffers. Remember, you can always accept John's offer of $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired profit margin. You can likely negotiate a better price by counteroffering.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell for $13,250.  This way, we both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a compromise:**  You've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable:**  $13,250 is still above your minimum price of $12,000.
* **It's reasonable:**  Splitting the difference makes the offer seem fair, potentially encouraging Bob to accept.

By keeping the negotiation open, you increase your chances of securing a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13250, which is $12625. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you would like to earn more, Bob's offer of $12,625 is very close to your minimum price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer guarantees you a profit.  

Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially since John is willing to pay $12,000.  It's better to secure a profit now than risk getting nothing at all."
