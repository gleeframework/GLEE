"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're keen on the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
