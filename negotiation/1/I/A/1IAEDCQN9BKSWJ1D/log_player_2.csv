You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and her offer is higher than that.  It's worth seeing if you can get her to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're keen on the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price point. It's better to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
