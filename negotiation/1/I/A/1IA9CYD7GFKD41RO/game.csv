"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $2000000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $900000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1100000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach your target, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $900000, which would be $1000000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not sure $1000000 is quite enough. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1050000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious effort to negotiate, but I'm at my limit. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made a serious effort to negotiate, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. How about we try $1050000 again? I know it's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
