Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value. I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me ($800,000) and the fallback option of selling to John for that price.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's definitely higher than what I'd get from John. Accepting this offer is the best choice for maximizing my profit."
