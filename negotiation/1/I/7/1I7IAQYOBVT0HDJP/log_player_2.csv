"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $500,000 is a significant amount, and there's a chance to negotiate a better price.  By rejecting, Bob can gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals his intent to negotiate aggressively and sets the stage for potential back-and-forth. While $300,000 is a big drop, it's still a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. Bob wants to see how much Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to push for a lower price.  He has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price.  There's still room for improvement, and by rejecting, Bob can continue to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he is serious about buying the product, but also that he's still not willing to pay Alice's asking price. By offering $350,000, Bob is trying to find a middle ground, hoping that Alice will accept a price closer to his desired range.  This counteroffer also demonstrates flexibility, which can be important in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a better price.  While $450,000 is getting closer to his goal, he can likely do better with a few more rounds of negotiation.  He's shown that he's willing to compromise, and Alice has already adjusted her price twice.  By rejecting, Bob can try to push for a price closer to his desired range of $350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer to $400,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise further. He has rejected Alice's previous offer, which shows he's not desperate to buy immediately. By offering $400,000, Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while still trying to secure a price closer to his target.  This counteroffer signals his intent to reach a deal soon, potentially leading to an agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price range, but also nearing the end of the negotiation.  He's shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but it's not clear if he'll get a better deal. Accepting the offer at $475,000 ensures a deal and saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise that balances potential further negotiation with the risk of not getting a deal."
