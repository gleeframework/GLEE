"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $15500? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14750. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can consider it.",14750.0,Bob,4,
