"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least close to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you need a fair price. How about we settle at $1,175,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it represents a good deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
