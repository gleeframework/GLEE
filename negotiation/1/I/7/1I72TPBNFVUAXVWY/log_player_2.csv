"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price lower than you anticipated. Let me know what you think.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least close to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price of $1,200,000."
