"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $125. Let's see if we can make this work.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  I'm still willing to work with you to find a price we're both happy with. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, so I'm going to offer $130. This is my final offer before I go with John's deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sticking with me and your offer is getting closer.  However, $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me.  Would you consider $133? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to avoid having to go with John's offer. What do you think?",133.0,Alice,5,
