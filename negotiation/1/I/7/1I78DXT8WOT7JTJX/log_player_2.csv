"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's make a deal!

print(""Reason:Alice came down to $10,500, which is only slightly above John's price. Continuing to negotiate might be risky, as Alice could walk away, and I'd end up paying John's full price anyway.  Saving $500 isn't worth that risk."")
