"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $8,500? That's a significant reduction from my initial price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  How about $8,000? That's a fair compromise and a significant drop from my previous offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
