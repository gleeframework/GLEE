"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and propose $975,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing us both to gain something from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring this product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,012,500. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while still allowing us to both achieve a successful outcome. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",1012500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,012,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm now offering it to you for $1,075,000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional benefits, such as a 6-month warranty and a dedicated support package. This is a unique opportunity for you to acquire the product with added value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
