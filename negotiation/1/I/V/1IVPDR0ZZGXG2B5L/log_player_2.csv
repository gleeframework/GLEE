"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above the product's worth to you.  We should try to negotiate a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  $1,050,000 is still a significant profit for her and closer to her value for the product. I'll try to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and propose $975,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing us both to gain something from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?

While Alice is showing some flexibility, $1,025,000 is still quite a bit higher than my preferred price.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get closer to my target before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,012,500. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while still allowing us to both achieve a successful outcome. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,012,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm now offering it to you for $1,075,000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional benefits, such as a 6-month warranty and a dedicated support package. This is a unique opportunity for you to acquire the product with added value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still too high for me, and this is our last round of negotiation with her.  While the added benefits are nice, they don't significantly change the value proposition enough to justify accepting a price that's above my target. It's better to buy from John for $1,500,000,  which is higher than what I'd like, but still within my budget."
