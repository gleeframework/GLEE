{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firmly set at $1,500,000. Accepting this offer secures a $300,000 profit. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely, at which point my only option is selling to John for a smaller profit ($0). 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with a worse outcome later."
