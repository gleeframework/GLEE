"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a deal that works better for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Bob,4,
