"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget. 
* **John's offer:** $15,000, which is Bob's absolute limit.

Since Alice's offer is higher than Bob's desired price, it's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to reach a deal, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000
* **Bob's counteroffer:** $12,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within Bob's maximum budget.

By offering a lower price, Bob is initiating a negotiation and expressing his willingness to compromise. This counteroffer also leaves room for a potential agreement between the two parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000
* **John's offer:** $15,000

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above Bob's ideal price. Bob has already established a lower price point, and rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation moving towards a better deal. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a deal that works better for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000
* **Bob's counteroffer:** $12,500,  a compromise that shows Bob is serious about making a deal but also keeps the price below Alice's last offer.

Bob is making a small increment, aiming to show he's willing to budge but not concede too much.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining some leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $12,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,750.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $12,750
* **John's offer:** $15,000

Alice has come down significantly, and her current offer is now closer to Bob's target price than John's offer.  Accepting this offer would mean saving $2,250 compared to buying from John.  While there are still rounds left to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer and losing the deal entirely is high. It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a lower price."
