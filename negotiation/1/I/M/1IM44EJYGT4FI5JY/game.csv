"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, reflecting the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I hope this aligns better with our interests.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,337,500? This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
