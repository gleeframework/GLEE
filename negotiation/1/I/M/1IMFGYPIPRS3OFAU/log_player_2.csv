"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I want to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is a bit too expensive for me. I'll try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'll offer $9,000, which is a good compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's well below the $15,000 it's worth to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit too high for me, considering the product is worth $8,000 to her. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further to get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she's already come down to $10,000, I'll try to get her to come down a bit more. I'll offer $8,500, which is closer to her minimum value of the product.
