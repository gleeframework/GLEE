Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum threshold and leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that he'll offer more in the next round, so accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum value for the product."
