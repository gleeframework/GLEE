"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $135. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go below $130. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $125 again?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $130, Bob, and I'm not willing to go back to $125. I think we're getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable selling at that point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $125, which would be $127.50. That's my final offer. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,7,
