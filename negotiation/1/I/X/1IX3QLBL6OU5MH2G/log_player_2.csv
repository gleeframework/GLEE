"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to make it more appealing to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a concession, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to secure the product from John at his desired price."
