"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. That's the lowest I can go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $9,250? This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget. Let's close this deal and make it work.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,900. That's the best I can do.",8900.0,Bob,6,
