The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $12,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

It's still better to try to negotiate a lower price, as Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000."

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still higher than what he's willing to pay. Since John is selling the product for $10,000, which is Bob's maximum price, it's best to buy from John."
