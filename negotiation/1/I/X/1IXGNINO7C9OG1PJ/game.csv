"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $10500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
