Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what it's worth to him, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also gives me a decent profit while still being lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and potentially negotiate further. However, I have a backup option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't feel the negotiation is moving in a favorable direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. It's still above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's closer to his offer and potentially more likely to be accepted. I'm hoping to close the deal without having to go back and forth further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
