,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my maximum budget for this item.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. I'm confident this price represents a fair value for both of us. ",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product brings.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price given that we're both trying to reach an agreement. ",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $9,000, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $11,000. I think it's worth it to me, and I'm willing to wait for the right buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer it to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,7,
