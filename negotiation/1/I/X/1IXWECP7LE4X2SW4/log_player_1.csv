"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  However, it's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $1,500,000, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to further concessions on both sides. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
