"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its true potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.** $950,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** While Bob could try to counter-offer again, Alice might become less flexible and ultimately demand a higher price.
* **Accepting the offer is a safe move.** It secures the product at a decent price without taking unnecessary risks."
