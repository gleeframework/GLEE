"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also convey the product's high value to me.  
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and provide insights into his negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my perspective, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I know I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is understandable, the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage further.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  My counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer and comfortably above my guaranteed price from John.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value, I'm reiterating its worth and providing a rationale for my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe this product is valuable, but $1,750,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my valuation and your need to move the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no benefit to further negotiation, as I have no reason to believe I can secure a higher price from Bob, and I risk him lowering his offer. Accepting now ensures I make the sale at my desired price."
