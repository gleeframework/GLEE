"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think, Bob?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $900,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
