"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  Let's see if Bob is interested in this price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering $125. This is still a good deal for Bob since it's below his perceived value of the product, but it also ensures I make a profit. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $122, which is still above my minimum threshold. It's a slight compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price and agree to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $118 is close to my minimum, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob doesn't seem to be budging much. I'm worried I might run out of rounds before he agrees on a price that's acceptable to me.  To avoid the risk of ending up with nothing, I'll sell the product to John for $120.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's a guaranteed profit."
