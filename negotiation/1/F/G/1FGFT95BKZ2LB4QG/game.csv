"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $10,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own valuation.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
